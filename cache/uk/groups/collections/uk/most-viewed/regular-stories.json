The teenagers arrived in a critical condition, according to hospital spokeswoman Martha Harlan.<br /></p> \n<p>Harlan said both victims had an arm amputated. The 16-year-old had his arm removed below the shoulder, while the 13-year old had hers amputated at the elbow. The girl also sustained serious tissue damage to her leg, according to Harlan.</p> \n<p>Both patients, whose names have not been released, have since had their conditions upgraded to “fair”.</p> \n<p>“I saw someone carry this girl [out of the water] and people were swarming around and trying to help,” Steve Bouser, who was just beginning his week-long beach vacation, told the Associated Press. “It was quite terrible.”</p> \n<p>The girl was bleeding heavily and people applied makeshift tourniquets while asking her questions to try to keep her conscious.</p> \n<p>It was “quite nightmarish”, Bouser said. </p> \n<p>His wife, Brenda Bouser, said: “It was so much like a scene from Jaws.” </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.wect.com/story/29316814/2-teens-lose-limbs-following-reported-shark-bites-in-oak-island\">Betty Wallace,</a> Oak Island’s <a href=\"http://www.wect.com/story/29316814/2-teens-lose-limbs-following-reported-shark-bites-in-oak-island\">mayor</a>, told CNN that shark attacks are so rare at Oak Island that she could not remember one occurring before the incident this weekend.</p> \n<p>Both attacks occurred at high tide in the vicinity of Ocean Crest Pier, a popular destination for beachgoers. “At the pier this time of year, I’m sure the beach was packed,” Wallace said.</p> \n<p>Local officials sent an all-terrain vehicle to get everyone out of the water, and the Brunswick county sheriff’s office was planning to have a helicopter patrol the coastline, the mayor said.</p> \n<p>Red flags have reportedly been hoisted at most Brunswick County beaches and a helicopter was scouring the waters for sharks.</p> \n<p>Wallace said on Sunday evening she had no further information on the girl’s condition. The girl is not from Oak Island but was visiting family, the mayor said.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Tim Holloman, the town manager, said that in 16 years he has never seen anything like what happened on Sunday. “Oak Island is still a safe place,” he told <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/teens-mauled-separate-shark-attacks-north-carolina-beach/story?id=31762489\">ABC news</a>. “We’re monitoring the situation. This is highly unusual.”</p> \n<p>He said the beaches would be open on Monday, but visitors would be encouraged not to go in the water.</p> \n<p>“The Brunswick county sheriff’s department will have Marine One and their helicopter support to monitor the coastline for any activities tomorrow,” he said.</p> \n<p>Due to the nature of the attacks, experts said it was highly likely that a large shark – such as the tiger or bull shark – was to blame.</p> \n<p>“This is the real deal threat,” <a href=\"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/fpsr/personnel.htm\">George Burgess of the University of Florida</a>, who has been studying sharks for 40 years, told ABC news. “This is highly unusual – I have seen this twice in 40 years.

All involved on that historic day would be astonished to think of its resonance since. Indeed, John never wanted it published and it was annulled by the pope nine weeks later. He ruled that the king had been forced to sign it under duress.</p> \n<p>It was redrafted in 1216, 1217 and 1225, and confirmed in English law in 1297 – 81 years after the death of John, a king one contemporary writer described as being “brimful of evil qualities” and whom history condemns as a cruel and lecherous tyrant.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3243a0b1c78fe724e6531ea38359674dd7c3359d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434322431619/c76043ab-5cb7-40ce-849d-a4fe1f28f9fe-339x420.jpeg\" alt=\"One of the four original 1215 Magna Carta documents.\" width=\"339\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the four original 1215 Magna Carta documents.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Esther Smith /Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most parts of it have since been repealed and it was originally an English document relevant only to rich, free, land-owning males.

Rather, say historians following a three-year study, the fact it survived was down to church scribes based at the ecclesiastical centres in Lincoln and Salisbury.</p> \n<p>The identity of those who wrote two of the four remaining copies were uncovered by the Magna Carta Project. Its principal investigator, Prof Nicholas Vincent, a medieval history expert at the University of East Anglia, said: “To have found and identified the work of these scribes, 800 years after their writing, is a significant achievement, certainly equivalent to finding needles in a very large haystack.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>“King John had no real intention that the charter be either publicised or enforced.

Landing in Melbourne, I went for a routine ultrasound as a beaming, expectant parent. I came out a grieving patient. The twins were dying in utero, unsuspectedly and unobtrusively, from some rare condition that I had never heard of. Two days later, I was induced into labour to deliver the two little boys whom we would never see grow. Then I went home. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/09/we-need-more-gps-new-ways-working\">We need more GPs – and new ways of working as they can’t do it all | Zara Aziz</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>If all this sounds a little detached it is because 10 years later I still have no words to describe the total bewilderment, the depth of sorrow and the intensity of loss that I experienced during those days. Some days, I really thought my heart would break into pieces. Ten years later, the din of happy children fills our house. But what I have found myself frequently reflecting on is how the behaviour of my doctors in those days profoundly altered the way in which I would treat my patients. </p> \n<p>An experienced obstetrician was performing my ultrasound that morning. Everything was going well and we chatted away about my new job until he frowned. Then he grimaced, pushed and prodded with the probe, and rushed out before I could utter a word. He then took me into his office and offered me his comfortable seat. Not too many pregnant women need a consultation at a routine ultrasound. </p> \n<p>“I am afraid I have bad news,” he said before sketching a picture to describe the extent of the trouble. I thought for a fleeting moment that my medical brain would kick in and I would present him with sophisticated questions to test his assertion that the twins were gravely ill. But of course, I was like every other patient, simultaneously bursting with questions while rendered mute by shock. </p> \n<p>I was well aware that doctors sometimes sidestepped the truth, usually with the intent of protecting the patient. I knew he could easily get away with not telling me any more until he had more information but I also knew that he knew. I read it in his face and I desperately wanted him to tell me. </p> \n<p>I asked the only question that mattered.</p> \n<p>“Will they die?”</p> \n<p>“Yes,” he said, simply holding my gaze until his tears started.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>In 13 years of medical training, I had never seen a doctor cry.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>As I took in the framed photos of children around his office he probably wished he could hide them all away. </p> \n<p>“I don’t know what to say,” he murmured, his eyes still wet. </p> \n<p>Until then, in 13 years of medical training, I had never seen a doctor cry. I had participated in every drama that life in bustling public hospitals offers but never once had I seen a doctor cry. </p> \n<p>My obstetrician’s tears stunned me but also provided immediate comfort. They normalised the mad grief that had begun to set inside me. Yes, the doctor’s expression said, this is truly awful and I feel sad too. </p> \n<p>“You are sure?”</p> \n<p>“There is a faint chance that one lives but if you ask me, things look bad. You know I will do everything I can to confirm this,” he said.</p> \n<p>The obstetrician had told the unflinching truth and in doing so almost surgically displaced uncertainty with the knowledge that I needed to prepare myself for what lay ahead. I had test after test that day, each specialist confirming the worst. I think I coped better because the first doctor had told the truth. </p> \n<p>Two other notable things happened that week. Among the wishes that flowed, another doctor wrote me an atypical condolence note. His letter began with the various tragedies that had taken place that week, some on home soil and others involving complete strangers. “I ask myself why,” he wrote, “and of course there is no answer to why anyone must suffer.”</p> \n<p>Until then, everyone had commiserated only at my loss – and I was enormously grateful – but here was someone gently reminding me that in life we are all visited by tragedy. All the support and love in the world won’t make you immune to misfortune, he was saying, but it will help ease the pain. </p> \n<p>Finally, there was the grieving. I lost count of the pamphlets that were left at our door to attend support groups, counselling sessions and bereavement seminars but we were resolutely having none of it. My midwife called me out of the blue – it was a moving exchange that taught me how deeply nurses are affected too. But I didn’t need counselling, I needed time. I valued the offers but I knew that my catharsis lay in writing. I wrote myself out of suffocating grief, which eventually turned to deep sadness and then a hollow pain, which eventually receded enough to allow me to take up my job as a brand new oncologist. How I would interpret the needs of my patients was fundamentally altered now that I had been one myself. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Cancer patients are very particular about how much truth they want to know and when.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Cancer patients are very particular about how much truth they want to know and when. I don’t decide for them but if they ask me I always tell the truth. A wife brings in her husband and his horrendous scans trigger a gasp of astonishment among even the non-oncologists. </p> \n<p>“Doctor, will he die from this?” she asks me. </p> \n<p>“I am afraid so,” I answer gently, “but I will do everything in my power to keep him well for as long as I can.” </p> \n<p>It is the only truthful promise I can make and although she is distressed she returns to thank me for giving her clarity. Sometimes honesty backfires, when the patient or family later say they wanted to talk but not really hear bad news. I find these encounters particularly upsetting but they are rare and I don’t let them sway me from telling the truth.</p> \n<p>Oncology is emotionally charged and I have never been afraid of admitting this to the very people who imbue my work with emotion. I don’t cry easily in front of patients but I have had my share of tears and tissues in clinic and contrary to my fears, this has been an odd source of comfort to patients. In his Christmas card, a widower wrote that when my voice broke at the news that his wife had died he felt consoled that the world shared his heartbreak. </p> \n<p>It can be tricky but I try to put my patients’ grief into perspective without being insensitive. It’s extraordinary how many of them really appreciate knowing that I, and others, have seen thousands of people who are frightened, sad, philosophical, resigned, angry, brave and puzzled, sometimes all together, just like them. It doesn’t diminish their own suffering but helps them peek into the library of human experiences that are catalogued by oncologists. It prompts many patients to say that they are lucky to feel as well as they do despite a life-threatening illness, which is a positive and helpful way of viewing the world. </p> \n<p>I will never know what kind of a doctor I might have become without the searing experience of being a patient. The twins would have been 10 soon. As I usher the next patient into my room to deliver bad news, I like to think that my loss was not entirely in vain. <br /></p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b3fd2110ae08a8fa804914954c9ead0d9383cede/0_261_4260_2555/4260.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2555,"width":4260,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Blend Images / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"AEB40W Doctor holding male patient  s hand in hospital room","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Blend Images / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T05:04:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T05:06:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":40,"contributors":[{"name":"Ranjana Srivastava","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/18/1416320691328/Ranjana-Srivastava-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ranjana-srivastava"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Doctors","Health","Society","Cancer","Parents and parenting","Family","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"society/doctors","webTitle":"Doctors"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"society/cancer","webTitle":"Cancer"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ranjana Srivastava","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ranjana-srivastava"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/15/losing-my-twin-baby-boys-forever-changed-the-way-i-treat-my-patients","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49nte","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/15/losing-my-twin-baby-boys-forever-changed-the-way-i-treat-my-patients","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/15/losing-my-twin-baby-boys-forever-changed-the-way-i-treat-my-patients"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b3fd2110ae08a8fa804914954c9ead0d9383cede/0_261_4260_2555/4260.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2555,"width":4260,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘My obstetrician’s tears stunned me but also provided immediate comfort.

My ears are ringing and my head is held in the vice-like grip of safety gear more suited to a spaceship.</p> \n<p>But what I’m actually wearing is a cycling helmet. It’s a <a href=\"http://www.hovding.com/\">H&ouml;vding</a>, an “airbag for cyclists”, invented in Sweden and billed as the helmet for people who don’t like wearing helmets. The H&ouml;vding promises superior protection in a crash without the need to actually put anything on your head.</p> \n<p>My “crash” was simulated for the camera’s benefit, but still I’m surprised by the drama of it all. The H&ouml;vding incorporates a lot of scientific research and a sophisticated algorithm that stops it going off unnecessarily, so to activate it I had to throw myself at the ground, headfirst. Moments before impact there was a loud bang, then there I was on the ground, stunned, wrapped in a hard white balloon.</p> \n<p>I’m one of those cyclists who never wears a helmet. I justify this to myself by pointing to the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f3817?ijkey=I5vHBog6FhaaLzX&amp;keytype=ref#ref-9\">ongoing controversy</a> over whether it they actually help. Some studies have suggested helmets encourage both riders and drivers to take more risks, <a href=\"http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/releases/overtaking110906.html\">and one study</a> suggested that cyclists wearing helmets are more likely to be involved in collisions with passing vehicles. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOolESrCcBw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NOolESrCcBw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the statistics can’t really counter my belief that, if I knew for sure I was going to crash, I’d rather be protected than not. When I started cycling I always wore one, but after several years without ever calling on it I started to leave it behind. Not because of vanity, I hasten to say. It’s not a head of carefully groomed hair I’m trying to protect. Rather it’s the hassle of having one more thing to carry once I’m off the bike. To the cinema, in restaurants, at the supermarket. Add to this the discomfort of a sweaty head covered in plastic and polystyrene in summer and it doesn’t seem worth it. So would a H&ouml;vding change my mind? In its resting state, the H&ouml;vding fits round your neck a bit like a scarf. It’s heavier than it looks, with a battery, airbag and all that Swedish technology inside. You need to keep it charged and switch it on when you set off.</p> \n<p>It’s a bit cumbersome off the bike, pulled backwards by the weight at the back, but when you’re cycling and leaning forward it’s fairly unobtrusive. I was expecting looks of admiration and envy at the traffic lights as other cyclists noticed my sophisticated piece of kit – but no one seemed to pay it any attention.</p> \n<p>I wouldn’t want to wear it off the bike, though, so it doesn’t really solve the problems I have with helmets. It’s a bit easier to carry around than a bog standard one as it can be folded and put in a (largish) bag, but not much. And at &pound;249 you certainly won’t be leaving it on your bike. Then there’s the heat – it might keep you warm in winter but having a chunky scarf around your neck in hot weather is not going to be pleasant.</p> \n<p>I did notice I felt safer with it on, though. I have a rule about not wearing headphones when cycling, but with the H&ouml;vding I broke that a few times, listening to music on my way home from work. It was great, but perhaps confirms those suggestions about taking extra risks if you think you’re protected.</p> \n<p>And since the H&ouml;vding can only be used once – although if you’re involved in an accident they sell you a replacement for &pound;99 – I probably won’t be splashing out any time soon. If, however, the crash hadn’t been simulated and the device had saved my life, &pound;249 might seem cheap at the price.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433777000542/Judith-Soal-wears-the-inf-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Judith Soal wears the inflated Hovding bike airbag following her simulated crash in north London.

Get one? That’s a discussion that will have been going on in the country’s living rooms during and after the first episode of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/humans\" title=\"\"><strong>Humans</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday). One meaning your own synthetic, or “synth”: a green-eyed humanoid robot.</p> \n<p>On the plus side it will clean and iron and then cook you a nice chicken chasseur for tea, freeing you up for all the good stuff you never find time for. It might even provide some kind of companionship. Plus there are potential upgrades, including adult ones, if you know what I’m saying.</p> \n<p>On the downside, there is a danger synths might make you, me, everyone redundant. They are already doing all the jobs people don’t really want to do, not just in the house, but street cleaning, handing out free newspapers, sex work etc (they are basically a bit like immigrants, I’m afraid). But it won’t be long before they’re doing the jobs you might want to do yourself – doctor, lawyer, politician, TV critic, footballer perhaps. The Singularity – when artificial intelligence overtakes human intelligence – isn’t far off. Also, returning to the basic domestic model, it might be a bit creepy having a machine that looks just like a person living in your house. It’s not good for the children either, it’ll mess with their heads. Plus you might be unlucky – like the Hawkins family – and get one, like Anita, that … who can think, and feel. Then things start to get really complicated.</p> \n<p>One of the beauties of Humans is that, like Charlie Brooker’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/black-mirror\" title=\"\">Black Mirror</a>, it really isn’t such a big leap, or ask. Only last week there was a story about Ocado creating an army of humanoids with artificial intelligence. The online supermarket robots might not be as pretty as Gemma Chan, who plays Anita (very convincing as a semi-humanoid), but this stuff is happening. Tellingly, Humans is set not some time in the future, but some time around now. It’s sci-fi for the non sci-fi fan, sci-fi that has more than a foot in sci-fact.</p> \n<p>It’s also a clever, high-energy thriller. Written – actually adapted from a Swedish series – by Spooks writers Sam Vincent and Jonathan Brackley, it has some of that show’s breathless urgency and tachycardiac pace. There are more of these sentient synths about the place, in the woods, plus urban wastelands, hiding, running. They are seen as a threat, bad dudes are after them, darting them, bundling them into vans, taking them away to be wiped clean, rebooted, decommissioned, or abused. Actually, it’s too early, and too simplistic, to divide into good and bad. There’s a more complicated, more realistic, more interesting morality to Humans.</p> \n<p>So you’re sitting on the edge of your seat, but maybe you’re also resting your chin in your hand, as you ponder technology, intelligence, consciousness, humanity, who we are and how we live now, and so on. And maybe that discussion you have should be not would you get a synth, but <em>will</em> you? Me? Are you kidding? Of course I bloody will. Mmm, chicken chasseur.</p> \n<p>Can there really be 100 Lego bricks for every child, woman and man in the world, as revealed in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-secret-world-of-lego\" title=\"\"><strong>The Secret World of Lego</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday)? Seven hundred billion bricks? By my calculations that would mean (for someone with average size feet) that approximately every other time you walked into a room bare-footed you’d step on a piece … yeah, so about right then.</p> \n<p>Head office, in the Danish village of Billund, is a secretive place where strange child-adults stick coloured bricks together, for their job. Secretive, until now; “Reputation Manager” Roar Rude Trangbaek has opened the doors and is showing us round, except for the product development area; as the camera approaches, the building’s shutters do their thing (shut).</p> \n<p>The cultishness of the company – or the fact that sugar isn’t allowed in the canteen – doesn’t put Justin off, a 23-year-old Afol (adult fan of Lego) from London from wanting to work there. Wanting to, and succeeding. The dream comes true! Of the thousands who apply, Justin is selected. And here he is, six months into the job. “It’s amazing, it’s this great family atmosphere, you feel like you’re part of something,” he says, smiling. There’s something slightly different about him, now he’s in, from before, when he was just a fan. I think Justin is lost, to Lego.</p> \n<p>Another interesting stat: in a couple of years the population of Minifigures will overtake humans … Hang on, this is beginning to feel like the other show.

Cox had appeared as a contestant on the reality show I Want to Work For Diddy (she did not end up working for the rap mogul, leaving in its sixth week) but OITNB was her breakout role. Her character Sophia is a transgender woman imprisoned for credit card fraud committed to fund her gender reassignment surgery. “I love her heart and soul,” Cox says. “She’s kinda sassy, too. I love the no-nonsense sass and the quiet wisdom she has.” She waves her hand. “I hate that word, sassy.” She pauses. “For years I would get direction from people asking, ‘Can you make her sassier?’ Which is code for, can you make it a little more ‘black’, a little more attitude?

There’s something that feels a little patriarchal about it too, right?” The <a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/SassyBlackWoman\">“sassy best friend” trope</a> has been a TV cliche for years; OITNB, an ensemble drama telling stories of women in prison, firmly rejects those stereotypes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9068726cea267852c7f34ef1f734b38744e5c496\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434127783635/2f87c12f-f0ba-4ad7-9660-993a6fd632d1-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A year before Caitlyn Jenner’s Vanity Fair viral sensation, Cox appeared on the cover of Time magazine\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A year before Caitlyn Jenner’s Vanity Fair viral sensation, Cox appeared on the cover of Time magazine. Photograph: Time</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cox agrees that it has one of the most diverse casts on television, “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/26/-sp-women-shonda-rhimes-shondaland\">outside of Shondaland</a>,” the studio run by the formidable Shonda Rhimes and which makes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prE0lIZOqbk\">Scandal</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_2707650637&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=baRfki0-L2Q&amp;v=q1pcpgREQ5c\">Grey’s Anatomy</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fGby9c7yyQ\">How to Get Away with Murder</a>. “Now we have <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBzu_jKLJek\">Empire</a> and other shows coming down the pipe that have more black and brown faces on them. I don’t know if we’re a trailblazer or not, but I would hate to think that this is a trend. It’s not enough to have people of different sexual orientations, races, genders, ages, sizes on television. The story must be compelling.”</p> \n<p>She leans over carefully (she’s wearing a skintight orange dress, “nothing to do with the show”, that leaves little room for manoeuvre) and shows me her Instagram account on her phone, where a picture of her and other cast members on the cover of <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/3rGwh1ih4D/?taken-by=lavernecox\">Essence magazine currently has over 19,000 likes</a>. “I’m a black transgender chick from Mobile, Alabama, I grew up poor and working class, and I’m on the cover of magazines,” she notes, with some amazement.</p> \n<p>Cox was raised with her twin brother – who plays her OITNB character in her pre-transition scenes – by a single mother. She endured relentless homophobic bullying as a child, and has described other children at school calling her names such as “sissy” and “faggot”, as well as being chased home from school. A teacher once informed her mother: “Your son is going to end up in New Orleans in a dress if we don‘t get him in therapy right away.” At 11, she attempted suicide, and credits a move to study dance at the Alabama School of Fine Arts with saving her life. In her late teens, she moved to New York to pursue acting. She describes herself as “gender-nonconforming” when she first arrived in the city, where she began her transition.</p> \n<p>I ask her where she went out when she first arrived, but she’s coy about naming the clubs, because “if I tell you the venues, it will date me too much”. She says she loved to just “go out and <em>dance</em>. It was before boys – well there’s never been a time before boys! – but, like, I wasn’t going out looking for boys. I was going out to dress up and have fun. And it felt so pure.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78271e4c34042c023b96ad2787df961d4d53289a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434128040413/331ce1f7-2cc2-49f8-a644-eaaa4999af42-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"'I love her heart and soul' ...

Laverne Cox as Sophia in Orange is the New Black. Photograph: Jessica Miglio for Netflix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The New York nightlife also provided Cox with a living. “A lot of black transgender women aren’t so lucky, but I was able to perform and put together a look that was able to fly.” In fact, during the first season of OITNB, Cox was still working at a restaurant called Lucky Cheng’s on the Lower East Side, where she had applied to work as a waitress, but ended up performing as a drag queen. She recognises how lucky she was to have the opportunity, and praises the queens and trans women she worked with who became her family, but says the job itself was “degrading, and it never stopped feeling degrading. We mostly catered to bachelorette parties, groups of girls who would come in from the outer boroughs to celebrate with ‘the freaks’. I don’t like to be negative, but that was the gig.”</p> \n<p>Cox left Lucky Cheng’s after the first season of OITNB wrapped, and has been in work almost constantly since, appearing on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePs3v9ls4sg\">The Mindy Project</a>, shooting a film, <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4270516/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_4\">Grandma</a>, with Lily Tomlin, fronting a pilot called Doubt for CBS and making a documentary on trans life for MTV, among plentiful other acting gigs. I ask her if she’s noticed a difference in the kinds of roles she is offered now; if, say, she is no longer being typecast as a prostitute. She gently corrects a poor choice of words. “I’ve played sex workers seven different times on television and in films. People who do sex work are human beings and deserve to have their stories told in humanising ways. But I’ve done it so much that I want to do something different.” I ask if I’ve made a faux pas with “prostitute”. “Maybe because I’ve talked to a lot of folks who do advocacy for sex workers, but for me it’s about acknowledging that it is work, so it’s less stigmatising, absolutely.”</p> \n<p>Cox has spent many months on a speaking tour of college campuses in the US and Canada with a lecture called Ain’t I A Woman. “Before I knew I was a trans woman I wanted to be on stage and act and dance, but my acting has given me the platform to speak out,” she says. “Before Orange, I was writing pieces about gender for the Huffington Post, and speaking in Albany for <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/laverne-cox/transgender-freedom-riders-the-fight-for-transgender-equality-in-new-york-state_b_3129833.html\">the passage of the Gender Expression Non-Discrimination Act</a>, but I just got a bigger platform.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1feeab8730d13b5095ef011203a3c24fc773260d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434128282804/0c6d3947-70df-4f32-986b-0b1e66a82919-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Laverne Cox (right)  in The Mindy Project\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Laverne Cox (right) in The Mindy Project.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fox vis Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Presumably it’s easier to simply not be the person everyone asks for an opinion on every issue connected to life as a trans person. “It’s intense, it’s hard,” she admits, but says she has always felt as if she should be of service, and has a sense of this being “God’s will for me, to be very grandiose about it.” Plus, she says, “I was frustrated with the way trans stories were being talked about in the media and press.”</p> \n<p>When Cox appeared on that cover of Time magazine, it was a vital, historical moment. She says now that with people like her and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/01/caitlyn-jenner-vanity-fair-cover-life-affirming\">Caitlyn Jenner</a> in the public eye, trans people are experiencing “unprecedented affirming visibility”. But visibility only goes so far. “We need more people of colour in positions of power at LGBT organisations, more trans people, different perspectives. And we need more queer and LGBT perspectives in black organisations, so we are not getting myopic,” she insists. She lists stark, horrifying statistics. “In the first eight weeks of 2015, seven trans women were murdered, and they were all trans women of colour. They’re not being murdered just because they’re trans, but because they’re at the intersection of identities, of race, class, homelessness. These issues have to be addressed if we want to end violence against trans folk.”</p> \n<p>We discuss <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database\">the Guardian’s project The Counted</a>, tracking the number Americans killed by police this year, which has revealed that black Americans killed by police are twice as likely to be unarmed as white Americans. “I don’t know if this is incendiary or not, but the United States was created on the backs of slave labour,” she says. “And so you have to reckon with the fact that the system is inherently a white supremacist system. That’s controversial to a lot of folks. There’s so much confirmation bias in how we’re raised and it can be deeply painful to realise that everything we thought about the world around us is a lie.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fee21e3fe6774dd5e544c8276e812b8a3c0105c5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434128474747/1fffd9ea-2828-4bf3-a581-adca3d6b4b54-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'I have to look in the mirror and say, this is my black nose, and it’s gorgeous.' Photograph: Andrew H Walker/Getty Images\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I have to look in the mirror and say, this is my black nose, and it’s gorgeous.’ Photograph: Andrew H Walker/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She wonders if this is why people struggle to understand transgender issues, and brings up a survey that suggests 92% of Americans believe they have never met a trans person. “People get so frustrated with this trans thing because they’re like, there’s just men and women, vaginas and penises, you’re either one or the other.” But, she says, it’s a western construct. “If you look at spirit traditions in the United States, or <a href=\"http://www.everyculture.com/South-Asia/Hijra-Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html\">hijra traditions in India</a>, religious cultures all over the world have fourth and fifth genders. And then Europeans and westerners came along and said, ‘What is this?’ Colonialism was not just about colonising whiteness, but about colonising the gender binary model.”</p> \n<p>There’s a moment of silence, and then we both start to to laugh: this is not exactly a typical celebrity interview. This willingness to not just be visible as a trans woman, but be radical about it too – to not just say publicly that Caitlyn Jenner looks good, but to assess what that reaction means for the trans community and women as a whole – is invigorating. When the Vanity Fair cover was released, Cox started a Twitter hashtag, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/transisbeautiful\">#transisbeautiful</a>, in order to “multiply trans narratives” – that is, to acknowledge that both her and Caitlyn’s situations are privileged, and theirs are not the only stories to tell. But she says there is an element of selfishness at play, too. “I started the hashtag to celebrate all the things that are beautiful about my transness,” she says. It’s hard to imagine Cox, so strident with her views, lacking in confidence, but she says becoming a public figure has amplified physical scrutiny of her.</p> \n<p>“I have been picking myself apart my whole life,” she says. “I have never talked about the medical details of my transition, and a lot of people assume I’ve had all this surgery. Years ago, I wanted really highly invasive surgical procedures to feminise my face. All these years later, I have the money to do it, but I don’t want it. I don’t want it! I’m happy that this is the face that God gave me, and it’s imperfect.” She says, with horror, that she was recently told by a commenter on Instagram that she should get her nose done. She didn’t reply. “No, girl! My fans were like, that’s the nose African Americans have, and what’s wrong with that? My fans had my back. In those moments I have to look in the mirror and say, this is my black nose, and it’s gorgeous.”</p> \n<p>She sits back in her chair and exhales dramatically. We covered a lot, didn’t we? “We covered <em>a lot</em>,” she laughs. “I think you got all of Laverne today. Let’s see how you handle it.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/06/orange-is-the-new-black-netflix-early-release-1201441766/\"><em>Orange is the New Black season three</em></a><em> is on Netflix now</em></p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434125117840/My-acting-has-given-me-th-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'My acting has given me the platform to speak out' … Laverne Cox.

Anderson was highly critical of the existing system of oversight of the surveillance agencies and set out a series of recommendations for reform.<br /></p> \n<p>A new surveillance bill, scheduled for the autumn, is expected to be the subject of fierce debate.<br /></p> \n<p>Responding to the Sunday Times, David Davis, the Conservative MP who is one of the leading campaigners for privacy, said: “We have to treat all of these things with a pinch of salt.” He said the use of an anonymous source to create scare stories was a typical tactic and the timing was comfortable for the government.<br /></p> \n<p>“You can see they have been made nervous by Anderson. We have not been given any facts, just assertions,” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>Anderson recommended that approval of surveillance warrants be shifted from the home and foreign secretaries to a new judicial body made up of serving and retired judges, which Davis supports but towards which the government appears to be lukewarm.<br /></p> \n<p>Davis said there was little point in raising the Sunday Times allegations in the Commons as the government would say it does not comment on intelligence matters. Davis’s prediction was prescient. A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “We don’t comment on leaks.” The intelligence agencies said: “Our longstanding policy is not to comment on intelligence matters.”</p> \n<p>But Eric King, the deputy director of Privacy International, echoed Davis, saying: “Looking at the Sunday Times, it asks more questions than it answers.” He added that if Downing Street and the Home Office believed that Russia and China had gained access to the Snowden documents, then why was the government not putting this out through official channels.<br /></p> \n<p>He added: “Given Snowden is facing espionage charges in the US, you would have thought the British government would have provided them with this information.”<br /></p> \n<p>Snowden, a former NSA contractor, handed over tens of thousands of leaked documents to the Guardian in Hong Kong two years ago. He left Hong Kong with flights booked to Latin America but was stopped in Russia when the US revoked his passport, and has been living in Moscow in exile since.<br /></p> \n<p>He has repeatedly said he handed over all the documents to journalists in Hong Kong and no longer has access to them, making it impossible for either China or Russia to get to them through him. The Sunday Times and BBC do not say where China or Russia allegedly gained access to the files.<br /></p> \n<p>Shami Chakrabarti, director of Liberty, said: “Last week, David Anderson’s thoughtful report called for urgent reform of snooping laws. That would not have been possible without Snowden’s revelations. Days later, an ‘unnamed Home Office source’ is accusing him of having blood on his hands. The timing of this exclusive story from the securocrats seems extremely convenient.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/14/snoopers-charter-anderson-report-home-office\">There is no real case for a snooper’s charter – but that won’t stop it | Tim Colbourne</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Andrew Mitchell, a former cabinet minister, said he was sure the Sunday Times got story because of the Anderson report. He added: “I think we have to be very careful of the argument ‘listen sonny, we know what you don’t know and therefore you should do what we say’. That is not a good argument; we need to have a proper debate about all of this.” </p> \n<p>“I don’t approve of what Snowden did, but I have to say having been to Washington recently that there has been a massive change of view in the United States, not just people like Rand Paul and so on, there’s a massive change of view about the debate and that has resulted from Snowden, whether you like it or not.”</p> \n<p>The White House said it had no comment on the UK government claims.</p> \n<p>Since the initial revelations about the extent of the bulk collection of communications data and the relationship between the intelligence agencies and internet companies, the US and British governments – and their intelligence agencies – have made a series of assertions that have subsequently been retracted.<br /></p> \n<p>Snowden was initially said to be a Chinese or Russian spy, but the US has since said this is not true. The US has also backtracked on claims that surveillance helped stop 56 plots and that Snowden had “blood on his hands”. <br /></p> \n<p>The British government and intelligence agencies in both countries issued warnings as far back as at least 18 months ago that the Snowden disclosures had helped terrorists, costing GCHQ, the UK’s main surveillance agency, up to 30% of its capabilities and that agents had had to be moved.<br /></p> \n<p>But privacy campaigners countered that no evidence had ever been provided to back up these assertions and that Snowden had done a public service by revealing the extent of illegal mass surveillance.<br /></p> \n<p>The allegations being made 18 months ago have now resurfaced in the Sunday Times. The paper quoted a source saying: “Agents have had to be moved and that knowledge of how we operate has stopped us getting vital information.” The source said they had no evidence that anyone had been harmed.</p> \n<p>A “senior Home Office source” was also quoted by the newspaper, saying: “Putin didn’t give him asylum for nothing. His documents were encrypted but they weren’t completely secure and we have now seen our agents and assets being targeted.”<br /></p> \n<p>The Sunday Times also quoted a “British intelligence source” saying that Russian and Chinese officials would be examining Snowden’s material for “years to come”.</p> \n<p>“Snowden has done incalculable damage,” the intelligence source reportedly said. “In some cases the agencies have been forced to intervene and lift their agents from operations to prevent them from being identified and killed.”</p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p> </p> \n<p></p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434240101610/e56fb8f5-2d87-4a23-8704-068fcf060b6b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Itar-Tass/Barcroft Media/Itar-Tass/Barcroft Media","altText":"Edward Snowden takes part in an online Q&A session from Moscow last year.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Itar-Tass/Barcroft Media/Itar-Tass/Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-14T15:58:27Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T08:38:19Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewen MacAskill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewenmacaskill"},{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Edward Snowden","Surveillance","US news","World news","Russia","China","Espionage","Encryption","MI6","NSA","The NSA files","Politics","UK security and counter-terrorism","Europe","Technology"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/edward-snowden","webTitle":"Edward Snowden"},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia"},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China"},{"id":"world/espionage","webTitle":"Espionage"},{"id":"technology/encryption","webTitle":"Encryption"},{"id":"uk/mi6","webTitle":"MI6"},{"id":"us-news/nsa","webTitle":"NSA"},{"id":"us-news/the-nsa-files","webTitle":"The NSA files"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uksecurity","webTitle":"UK security and counter-terrorism"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/14/russia-and-china-broke-into-snowden-files-to-identify-british-and-us-spies","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49n8j","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jun/14/russia-and-china-broke-into-snowden-files-to-identify-british-and-us-spies","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/14/russia-and-china-broke-into-snowden-files-to-identify-british-and-us-spies"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434240101610/e56fb8f5-2d87-4a23-8704-068fcf060b6b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Edward Snowden taking part in an online Q&amp;A session from Moscow last year.
