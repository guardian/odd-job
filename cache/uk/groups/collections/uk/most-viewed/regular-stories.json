We are very sorry that we were unable to send an ambulance before we were cancelled by the police at 9.25pm and are now looking into the circumstances of what happened.”</p> \n<p>She confirmed that the LAS did not attend and that police officers took the woman to a south London hospital. </p> \n<p>The victim’s mother, Ida Bantala, has told how she was upstairs in her flat in Peckham when someone came screaming to her door, saying: “‘Malorie’s mum, Malorie’s mum, come quickly!’ I rushed down and there she was just lying on the pavement with the police.</p> \n<p>“She was just crying and crying. If you see your daughter like that, it’s awful. Words can’t explain it,” she told reporters. “Then, about an hour later maybe, they took her to hospital and I went with her. She was talking to the police for a long time.”</p> \n<p>She said the family had lived in the area since 2001 and had never encountered any trouble. Her daughter had been working since finishing university, she said, and was excited about having the baby.</p> \n<p>“I wanted to be a grandma. She was so happy and now she is sick in hospital,” she said. “I had seen a man hanging around with a crash helmet but I had no idea that it would turn out like this or it was anything to do with Malorie. The police have been good – they have to catch whoever did this to my precious daughter.”</p> \n<p> DCI Robert Pack, from the Metropolitan police’s homicide and major crime command, is leading the investigation.</p> \n<p>“This was a truly abhorrent and vile attack on a heavily pregnant woman who has now, tragically, lost her baby,” he said. “The suspects were distinctive in their crash helmets and we would appeal for anyone who saw them either before the attack or running from the scene to please come forward and contact us.”</p> \n<p>He later told Sky News: “[A suspect] has been been arrested on GBH [grievous bodily harm] with intent to the young mum-to-be herself, and also child destruction for what happened to her unborn, sadly passed away, foetus.”</p> \n<p>Pack said he had never seen a crime like it. “It’s an indication of how seriously the Metropolitan police are taking this that it’s been passed to my team, the homicide and serious crime command. We are treating this with all the resources and seriousness of a murder investigation.”</p> \n<p> In 2000 a man who stamped on his pregnant girlfriend’s abdomen was convicted of manslaughter after her baby was born alive then died.</p> \n<p>Monday’s attack took place on a patch of ground metres away from a children’s playground and between two council blocks, one of which is home to the Bantala family.</p> \n<p>A police cordon, which had been in place earlier this week at the scene, has now been taken down. A woman who lives in the same block as the Bantalas said the attack had come as a shock. “Although it’s a council estate, there is generally never any trouble and it has felt safe living here.”</p> \n<p> </p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434567080132/f58b6bea-591a-4283-bee6-9d98cd322039-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"National News and Pictures","altText":"Malorie Bantala, who lost her unborn baby after being brutally attacked in Peckham.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: National News and Pictures"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434568277938/f1616c84-38fa-47a0-a84b-f1ee98bd66eb-2060x1545.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1545,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Talfourd Place in Peckham, south London.

Pinckney campaigned for legislation to require police officers to wear body cameras while working. He said: “Body cameras help to record what happens. It may not be the golden ticket, the golden egg, the end-all-fix-all, but it helps to paint a picture of what happens during a police stop.”. The Rev Joseph Darby, the presiding elder at Beaufort AME Church, described Pinckney as “an advocate for the people”. He told MSNBC: “He was a very caring and competent pastor, and he was a very brave man. Brave men sometimes die difficult deaths.”.

Therefore, it’s mostly adults who consume <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2012/dec/28/seoul-k-pop-gangnam-style\">K-pop culture</a>. Teenagers don’t usually have enough cash unless their parents are affluent, high-ranking officials.</p> \n<p>Under former leader Kim Jong-il’s leadership, people didn’t feel comfortable listening to any songs that sounded different from traditional and familiar trot songs – recognised as the oldest form of Korean pop music, and even when they listened to South Korean songs they often preferred older tunes to newer hits. </p> \n<p>But since 2012, South Korean songs have become increasingly popular amongst DPRK listeners, including K-pop classics such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aIdVi9DQWbM\">Friend</a> by Ahn Jae-wook, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbvaYfJh6kM\">Private’s Letter</a> by Kim Kwang Seok and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7heZ1IQiI8c\">For Love.</a><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7heZ1IQiI8c\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7heZ1IQiI8c?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>More recently when the South Korean drama <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_18\">Sweet 18</a> became popular in the North, South Korean singer Jang Nara, who sang on the soundtrack, attracted a lot of attention in the DPRK.</p> \n<p>While I was still living in North Korea, my favourite K-pop song was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1VNANLwufs\">Like Being Shot by a Bullet</a> by Baek Ji-young. But since my mum didn’t like it, I couldn’t sing it at home. </p> \n<p>What’s clear is that North Korea’s younger generation has tastes that stretch far and wide, and they’re a big reason by K-pop singers have been getting more popular.
