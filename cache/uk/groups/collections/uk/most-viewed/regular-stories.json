It said: “Social class, however defined, apparently remains a strong determinant of one’s ability to access the elite professions and, once there, to thrive. Yet still, this study would suggest that within elite firms, awareness of the role played by social background in relation to career progression is quite low, especially compared to other diversity axes such as gender. Further, participants spoke of their reluctance to discuss social class with their colleagues, on the basis that this is potentially intrusive.”</p> \n<p>Some of the firms studied had adopted “CV-blind” selection techniques to hide an applicant’s educational background in an effort to increase social mobility. But it found that this sometimes had the unintended consequences of encouraging interviewers to focus on “proxies for quality such as speech and accent”.</p> \n<p>Louise Ashley – of Royal Holloway, University of London, who led the research – urged firms to recruit from a wider range of applicants.

I’m head[ing] back for another water board session.”</p> \n<p>Doctors and intelligence experts said they could imagine legitimate, non-abusive CIA uses for human experimentation.</p> \n<p>Steven Aftergood, a scholar of the intelligence agencies with the Federation of American Scientists, suggested that the agency might need to study polygraph effects on its agents; evaluate their performance under conditions of stress; or study physiological indicators of deception.</p> \n<p>But all said that such examples of human experimentation would require something that the CIA never had during the interrogation program: the informed consent of its subjects.</p> \n<p>“There is a disconnect between the requirement of this regulation and the conduct of the interrogation program,” said Aftergood. “They do not represent consistent policy.”</p> \n<h2><strong>A director’s decision, oversight and an evolving rulebook</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f159858a811f35772e67ecd90be6799ca91b12c7\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f159858a811f35772e67ecd90be6799ca91b12c7/0_467_2190_1314/1000.jpg\" alt=\"george tenet george bush\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Tenet at the White House in 2003, after his historic approval of so-called ‘enhanced interrogation techniques’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Eric Draper/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Months after Zubaydah’s interrogation, Tenet issued formal guidance approving brutal interrogation techniques, including waterboarding. Tenet explicitly ordered medical staff to be present – a decision carrying the effect of having them extensively document and evaluate the torture sessions.</p> \n<p>“[A]ppropriate medical or psychological personnel must be on site during all detainee interrogations employing Enhanced Techniques,” Tenet wrote in January 2003. “In each case, the medical and psychological staff shall suspend the interrogation if they determine that significant and prolonged physical or mental injury, pain or suffering is likely to result if the interrogation is not suspended.”</p> \n<p>In response to the Guardian’s questions about the newly disclosed document and its implications for the CIA’s post-9/11 torture program, CIA spokesperson Ryan Trapani provided the following statement:</p> \n<p>“CIA has had internal guidelines interpreting Executive Order 1233 in place continuously from 1987 to present. While some provisions in these guidelines have been amended since September 11, 2001, none of those amendments changed provisions governing human experimentation or were made in response to the detention and interrogation program.”</p> \n<p>Ironically, the only part of the CIA’s torture program in which agency officials claimed they were hamstrung by prohibitions on human experimentation is when they were asked by John Helgerson, their internal inspector general, if torture was effective.</p> \n<p>Their response was framed as an example of the agency respecting its own prohibition on human experimentation. In more recent days, the CIA has used it as a cudgel against the Senate report’s extensive conclusions that the torture was ultimately worthless.</p> \n<p>“[S]ystematic study over time of the effectiveness of the techniques would have been encumbered by a number of factors,” reads a CIA response given to Helgerson in June 2003, a point the agency <a href=\"https://www.cia.gov/news-information/press-releases-statements/2014-press-releases-statements/cia-fact-sheet-ssci-study-on-detention-interrogation-program.html\">reiterated</a> in its formal response to the Senate intelligence committee.

The 4 theories","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T11:59:53Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-15T12:06:55Z","body":"No one expects Jeremy Corbyn to win the Labour leadership contest. (Paddy Power have him as the 50/1 outsider in odds they have released today.) But the fact that he is in the contest will make a difference to the way it is conducted. And who will benefit? There are at least four theories, two of which are very plausible, one of which is less credible, and one of which is more tentative. Let’s start with the iffy one. 1 - Yvette Cooper or Liz Kendall benefit - because Corbyn splits the leftwing vote. A version of this theory was floated in the Sun on Sunday just over a week ago, when it claimed that Blairites were helping Corbyn get on the ballot to handicap Andy Burnham (the current favourite) by splitting the leftwing vote. But this scenario does not really stack up, for various reasons. First, the Labour party uses a preferential voting system, and the votes of the candidates who comes last get redistributed. So, if Corbyn were to come last in the first round, and most of his supporters were to choose Burnham as the next-best choice for leftwingers, Burnham would not lose out anyway. Second, it may well be Kendall who comes last in the first ballot. And, third, although Burnham is seen in some quarters as more “leftwing” than Cooper, this is highly questionable. 2 - Andy Burnham benefits - because he is no longer seen as the leftwinger. Burnham and Cooper are broadly similar in their politics, and the leftwing/centrist labels applied to them are not particularly helpful. But many people still currently perceive the contest through this prism, and Cooper has actively tried to portray herself as the centrist candidate, with Burnham on the left and Kendall on the right. In the light of that, Corbyn’s presence on the ballot paper helps Burnham, because it stops him being perceived as the leftwinger in the race. In his perceptive book on Labour under Ed Miliband, Five Year Mission, Tim Bale says that in 2010 David Miliband did not realise until far too late how much having Diane Abbott on the ballot helped his brother. David Miliband’s team clearly recognised the obvious threat his brother’s positioning posed to their man, even if none of them realised till far too late that their champion’s politically correct gesture to “lend” some of his supporters to Diane Abbott in order to ensure she got nominated was an act of unthinking idiocy that made it much, much easier for Ed than it should have been to avoid being branded the stand-out leftwinger in the contest. 3 - Corbyn benefits - obviously - and the left too. Sometime the obvious answers are the right ones. Who benefits from Corbyn being on the ballot? Well, Corbyn. To be fair, he is not an enthusiastic campaigner - he only agreed to stand after being encouraged to do so by activists - and he said this morning he did not even think the leadership contest should be taking place now. (See 11.39am.) But, now he is on the ballot, he may do surprisingly well. (He came top in a LabourList readers’ survey a few days ago.) You would still be unwise to put money on him winning, even at Paddy Power’s 50/1. But a reasonably strong showing by Corbyn could make it harder for the new leader to marginalise the left. On that basis, you could argue that there is a fourth answer to the “who benefits?” question. 4 - The Tories - because having Corbyn on the ballot will keep Labour anchored to the left. It is probably too soon to assert this as a definite consequence. But on Twitter some Tories are already crossing their fingers. This is from Lord Ashcroft.

There are at least four theories, two of which are very plausible, one of which is less credible, and one of which is more tentative.</p> \n<p>Let’s start with the iffy one.</p> \n<p><strong>1 - Yvette Cooper or Liz Kendall benefit - because Corbyn splits the leftwing vote.</strong></p> \n<p>A version of this theory was floated <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/politics/6490676/Worried-Labour-MPs-plot-to-halt-Andy-Burnham.html\">in the Sun on Sunday just over a week ago</a>, when it claimed that Blairites were helping Corbyn get on the ballot to handicap Andy Burnham (the current favourite) by splitting the leftwing vote. But this scenario does not really stack up, for various reasons. First, the Labour party uses a preferential voting system, and the votes of the candidates who comes last get redistributed. So, if Corbyn were to come last in the first round, and most of his supporters were to choose Burnham as the next-best choice for leftwingers, Burnham would not lose out anyway. Second, it may well be Kendall who comes last in the first ballot. And, third, although Burnham is seen in some quarters as more “leftwing” than Cooper, this is highly questionable.</p> \n<p><strong>2 - Andy Burnham benefits - because he is no longer seen as the leftwinger.</strong></p> \n<p>Burnham and Cooper are broadly similar in their politics, and the leftwing/centrist labels applied to them are not particularly helpful. But many people still currently perceive the contest through this prism, and Cooper has actively tried to portray herself as the centrist candidate, with Burnham on the left and Kendall on the right. In the light of that, Corbyn’s presence on the ballot paper helps Burnham, because it stops him being perceived as the leftwinger in the race. In his perceptive book on Labour under Ed Miliband,<a href=\"http://ukcatalogue.oup.com/product/9780198702962.do\"> Five Year Mission</a>, <strong>Tim Bale </strong>says that in 2010 David Miliband did not realise until far too late how much having Diane Abbott on the ballot helped his brother.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>David Miliband’s team clearly recognised the obvious threat his brother’s positioning posed to their man, even if none of them realised till far too late that their champion’s politically correct gesture to “lend” some of his supporters to Diane Abbott in order to ensure she got nominated was an act of unthinking idiocy that made it much, much easier for Ed than it should have been to avoid being branded the stand-out leftwinger in the contest.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>3 - Corbyn benefits - obviously - and the left too. </strong></p> \n<p>Sometime the obvious answers are the right ones. Who benefits from Corbyn being on the ballot? Well, Corbyn. To be fair, he is not an enthusiastic campaigner - <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/04/labour-mp-jeremy-corbyn-leadership-anti-austerity-platform\">he only agreed to stand after being encouraged to do so by activists</a> - and he said this morning he did not even think the leadership contest should be taking place now. (See <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/live/2015/jun/15/labour-leadership-nominations-close-at-noon-politics-live#block-557ea789e4b07c61f71d1eca\">11.39am.)</a> But, now he is on the ballot, he may do surprisingly well. <a href=\"http://labourlist.org/2015/06/jeremy-corbyn-emerges-as-the-winner-in-labourlist-leadership-survey/\">(He came top in a LabourList readers’ survey a few days ago.) </a>You would still be unwise to put money on him winning, even at Paddy Power’s 50/1. But a reasonably strong showing by Corbyn could make it harder for the new leader to marginalise the left. </p> \n<p>On that basis, you could argue that there is a fourth answer to the “who benefits?” question.</p> \n<p><strong>4 - The Tories - because having Corbyn on the ballot will keep Labour anchored to the left.</strong></p> \n<p>It is probably too soon to assert this as a definite consequence.

The girl is not from Oak Island but was visiting family, the mayor said.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Tim Holloman, the town manager, said that in 16 years he has never seen anything like what happened on Sunday. “Oak Island is still a safe place,” he told <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/US/teens-mauled-separate-shark-attacks-north-carolina-beach/story?id=31762489\">ABC news</a>. “We’re monitoring the situation.

It was, according to Cesar, a “stupid, stupid tackle” that Rooney apparently inflicted on him in England’s 3-1 win at Wembley, though he insisted he was not after revenge in the return game in Ljubljana. “On the pitch I am very aggressive and I enjoy the fight in physical games, but I don’t want to kill him.” He did, however, leave his calling card in the form of the forearm smash into the side of Rooney’s head during England’s 3-2 win and, putting aside for one moment the story of England’s captain and Sir Bobby Charlton’s goals record, that was a moment to demonstrate why the Manchester United player is now entrusted with the armband.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/wayne-rooney-strength-character-roy-hodgson-england\">Wayne Rooney’s character lauded by Roy Hodgson after England win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Roy Hodgson made the same point after Rooney had moved alongside Gary Lineker on 48 England goals, one short of Charlton with the usual turkey-shoot against San Marino conveniently timed in September to help him get over the line. “Wayne Rooney’s performance says a lot of things about him as a man,” Hodgson said. “Just before he took that chance he took a nasty blow from an elbow, which could have decked many a player and led to him losing his discipline. It didn’t and he got up. I like what that shows, and the fact that one or two chances had gone begging but when the ball fell to him he still stuck it away with aplomb. We can rely on that man.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457160825__\n</div> \n<p>In the buildup to this match, Rooney had talked about speaking to Ross Barkley at the end of a difficult season for the Everton midfielder and discussing with his fellow Liverpudlian the areas of his game that needed to improve. Rooney was not everyone’s choice to take over from Steven Gerrard as England captain but in his first year in the role he has scored eight goals in ten games, not been booked once and is yet to be on a losing side. These are still relatively early days but he has taken on the captaincy with distinction so far. <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/slovenia-england-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report\">Match report: Slovenia 2-3 England</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/wayne-rooney-strength-character-roy-hodgson-england\">Rooney’s character lauded by Hodgson</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/14/jack-wilshere-no-regrets-england-thunderbolts\">Dominic Fifield on Jack Wilshere’s impressive display</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>2) Maloney is Scotland’s man of this qualifying campaign</h2> \n<p>Gordon Strachan’s elation over the goal which hauled Scotland back into the game against the Republic of Ireland was matched only by the manager’s delight about the man who helped to provide it. Shaun Maloney has always been an independent thinker and occasionally an over-thinker. His is a career which continues to yield marquee moments, a matter apparently not impacted by his decision to continue his career in Major League Soccer. Maloney could quite easily have remained in England when departing Wigan Athletic last summer but fancied a fresh challenge. The attacker is Scotland’s man of this Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. He has consistently been the one to make things happen. When emerging as youth players at Celtic, it was generally accepted that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/aiden-mcgeady-ireland-scotland\">Aiden McGeady was of superior talent</a> to Maloney but the latter’s work ethic and attitude continues to reward him.

Ireland and Scotland’s 1-1 draw at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday was a messy game but a decent result for the Scots, who have looked throughout the campaign the more accomplished of the two teams. Shaun Maloney, James Morrison, Steven Naismith and Scott Brown may not be quite professor-level just yet. But even in a scruffy game there was confirmation in Dublin that Gordon Strachan – who is himself approaching national treasure status – has assembled a team that might not ever threaten to reach the final stages of Euro 2016 but which would at least look it was playing the same game as the best teams there.</p> \n<p>Against Ireland Scotland passed the ball well enough, crafted some nice triangles on the flanks and generally looked most comfortable playing a technically sound pass-and-move game. Should they fail to qualify from here they will do so in the knowledge that they have at least been pushing in the right direction, whereas much of the gloom around Ireland’s current trajectory is a sense that the basic method is simply a little out of date. Maloney was the most eye-catching player in midfield on Saturday, scorer now of five goals in qualifying and a fine all-round playmaking presence. Scotland may be two or three really good players (at least one of them a high class striker) away from being a top quality team. But Maloney and his fellow ball-playing midfielders would certainly add to the gaiety of a major tournament. Even in the fury of Dublin the glimpses in this qualifying campaign of a more historically Scottish Style have been a pleasure to watch. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/republic-of-ireland-martin-oneill-advantage-scotland\"><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> O’Neill claims Scotland’s Naismith ‘refereed the game</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>4) Coleman has discovered a match-winning blend</h2> \n<p>The headlines, inevitably, were commandeered by Gareth Bale, who inspired Wales to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/jun/12/wales-v-belgium-european-2016-qualifier-live\">1-0 win over Belgium</a> last Friday. It was not just his decisive goal, rather the confidence that he spread among his teammates. Yet this momentous effort, which set Wales fair for the Euro 2016 finals – and their first appearance at a major championship since 1958 – was characterised by a collective thou-shalt-not-pass attitude.</p> \n<p>It has underpinned the campaign so far. Chris Coleman, who deserves huge credit for the turnaround he has overseen, has watched his team concede only two goals, and neither Andorra’s penalty nor Cyprus’ slightly streaky free-kick were from open play. This was Belgium’s second blank against Wales and although they exerted pressure, they were unable to create too much of clear-cut note.</p> \n<p>Led by the indomitable Ashley Williams, Wales put bodies on the line and kept Belgium’s highly-rated attackers at arm’s length. But it was not just the defence since Bale and the midfielders worked tirelessly, too. Coleman keeps getting his tactics and organisation spot on.

The focus was exclusively on Wales. Yet on the day of the game, he became embroiled in a remarkable row. Wilmots had been tipped to take over at Schalke, having held talks with the Bundesliga club and he said that he would talk publicly about his future after the Wales game.</p> \n<p>Yet Schalke moved first, announcing that they had appointed Andr&eacute; Breitenreiter to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/26/roberto-di-matteo-resigns-schalke-coach-disagreement-club\">replace Roberto Di Matteo</a>, who resigned in May. Wilmots was furious and he immediately made his feelings known in an interview with Kicker. “To announce such a thing just hours before our crucial Euro 2016 qualifier is incredible and really bad form,” Wilmots said. “Schalke approached me, which is why it’s a bad joke when they make out now that they have turned me down.”</p> \n<p>Toby Alderweireld, the Belgium defender, told the Guardian that Wilmots had addressed his future with the players beforehand. “He told us before the game that he is staying,” Alderweireld said. Had the issue been a distraction? “No,” Alderweireld said. “As a group, we were focused on the result.” The subsequent defeat, however, gave Wilmots’ critics plenty of ammunition. <strong>DH</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/belgium-fans-trust-satnav-end-up-in-wrong-wales\">Belgium fans trust sat nav and end up in the wrong Wales</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2><strong>6) </strong>Northern Ireland architects of their own fate</h2> \n<p>Flinty Northern Ireland have finally vaulted a major psychological hurdle, as Saturday’s battling draw at home to Romania positions them nicely for Euro 2016 automatic qualification by September. The visit of Anghel Iordanescu’s side presented a stern test of character. And Northern Ireland’s industry, constantly compressing space for the group leaders, outlined a steadfast capacity to mix it when their normal, crisp, passing approach and fluidity along the channels to lone forward Kyle Lafferty starts to malfunction. Michael O’Neill’s men are now the architects of their own fate. Victories over Faroe Islands and Hungary will spirit them towards France. It helps that the Hungarians, two points adrift of Northern Ireland in third place, must play their Romanian rivals next. O’Neill’s job could get so much easier. If Lafferty, Steven Davis – “the brain of Northern Ireland” according to Iordanescu - and Jonny Evans, Northern Ireland’s best performers at the weekend, remain fit, it would be even better news. All three retain a solid presence which unquestionably carries the whole squad to greater heights and horizons. <strong>Julian Taylor</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/northern-ireland-romania-euro-2016-qualifying-match-report\">Match report: Northern Ireland 0-0 Romania</a></p> \n</blockquote>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434354121764/0095edf5-d6a7-463a-86d2-862c816330b1-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty/Action/PA/Euro 2016 qualifiers talking points","altText":"Euro 2016 qualifiers","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty/Action/PA/Euro 2016 qualifiers talking points"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434139394424/Gareth-Bale-and-Wales-tea-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gareth Bale and Wales team-mates celebrate the deciding goal against Belgium.
