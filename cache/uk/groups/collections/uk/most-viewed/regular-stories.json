She appeared in court on Wednesday with Dylan Snel, a Dutch tourist, and Lindsey and Danielle Petersen, two Canadian siblings, court sources have confirmed.</p> \n<p>The four were remanded for four days pending further investigations into alleged indecency.</p> \n<p>Hawkins’ father, Tim Hawkins, who runs his own mechanical engineering business in Derby, said: “I would like to appeal to the Malaysian authorities. I have got every faith in their judicial system. I just hope they don’t make an example of them after the tragic earthquake.”</p> \n<p>Tim Hawkins told the Guardian that he spoke to his daughter on Wednesday morning: “She is obviously upset. She’s pretty scared. But it was good to speak to her.”</p> \n<p>He also spoke of his daughter’s relief to be in the hands of the Malaysia authorities after the stunt prompted an angry backlash among the Malaysian public. “She’s kind of relieved because she saw it coming. It’s good to know where she is. It is not the kind of situation you envisage when your daughter goes travelling.”</p> \n<p>Eleanor Hawkins is understood to be held in a cell with Danielle Petersen. Ronny Cham, Hawkins’ lawyer, told the Guardian he requested the group be held separately for their own safety because of the level of public anger generated by the alleged stunt.</p> \n<p>Officials in Sabah state, in the northern half of the island of Borneo, accused the tourists of showing “disrespect to the sacred mountain”, which at 4,095 metres is south-east Asia’s highest peak.</p> \n<p>Sabah’s indigenous Kadazan Dusun people believe the tourists’ behaviour angered the spirit of the mountain and was the reason for a 5.9-magnitude earthquake, which six days later struck near the mountain, killing 18 climbers.</p> \n<p>Hawkins was third to enter the court on Wednesday, as the group was ushered in handcuffed together and dressed in purple prison uniforms.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10153050483152675&amp;hc_location=ufi\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=10153050483152675\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Facebook video of the four alleged nudists appearing in court\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The four were remanded until 14 June. Cham said they are likely to be charged with “causing annoyance by conducting obscene acts in a public place”.</p> \n<p>He said if found guilty they could face three months in prison, or a fine, or both. He said if charged, the defence is likely to argue that the top of the mountain should not be defined as a public place where annoyance could be caused to the public. </p> \n<p>Cham accused local state officials of of stoking a public backlash against the tourists. He said: “I asked the court they be held in separate custody from other detainees. Because of the sentiment in this case, we want to protect their safety. People are laying blame on them for offending the mountain. There is a lot of stupidity involved and unfortunately politicians have jumped on the bandwagon to condemn them for causing the earthquake, which is ridiculous.”</p> \n<p>The Foreign Office in London confirmed that a British national had been arrested and consular assistance was being provided.</p> \n<p>Sabah’s deputy chief minister, Joseph Pairin Kitingan, said a special ritual will be conducted to “appease the mountain spirit”.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/Malaysia_Latest/statuses/608510863478259712\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">malaysiakini: Four foreigners held for stripping atop Mt Kinabalu <a href=\"http://t.co/zjEjc9YxA9\">http://t.co/zjEjc9YxA9</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/SabahQuake?src=hash\">#SabahQuake</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/thr14eX6Hr\">pic.twitter.com/thr14eX6Hr</a></p>— Malaysia News (@Malaysia_Latest) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Malaysia_Latest/status/608510863478259712\">June 10, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Sabah’s state tourism minister, Masidi Manjun, tweeted that legal proceedings against the four foreigners had begun and that they would be remanded for four days.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/MasidiM/statuses/608491716400668673\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Legal proceedings have commenced in court against 4 alleged 'strippers on Mt Kinabalu' this morning.

The US, Mexico and Canada were expected to be among the bidders.</p> \n<p>Swiss prosecutors and the FBI are both looking into the controversial bidding process for the 2018 tournament, to be played in Russia, and the 2022 World Cup, awarded to Qatar. A disputed summary of a Fifa ethics committee report last year ruled there was not sufficient evidence to strip either country of the World Cup but the head of the audit and compliance committee, Domenico Scala, has confirmed it remains a possibility if new evidence emerges.</p> \n<p>The summary, which sparked the resignation of the report’s author Michael Garcia, detailed a list of allegations against Qatar and said Russia had been unable to cooperate because the organising committee had lost all its emails.</p> \n<p>Following a meeting of the World Cup organising committee in Samara, Valcke insisted the Russian World Cup was on track before the qualifying draw in St Petersburg in July. “Overall the preparations for the Fifa Confederations Cup and the Fifa World Cup as well as our first major event, the preliminary draw, are well under way and on schedule,” said Valcke.</p> \n<p>Russia’s 2018 local organising committee chairman, Vitaly Mutko, also a member of the Fifa executive committee and the country’s sports minister, said preparations were “well on track and on schedule”. He added: “There’s no doubt all the events of 2018 Fifa World Cup in Russia will go through at top level.”</p> \n<p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, had been critical of the US investigation, claiming it was a plot to oust the Fifa president, Sepp Blatter, and destabilise the 2018 World Cup.</p> \n<p>Valcke also defended Fifa’s handling of a $10m payment to a Caribbean Football Union account controlled by Warner, the former Fifa vice-president whose deputy Chuck Blazer has pleaded guilty in court of taking some of the money as a bribe to vote for South Africa to host the 2010 World Cup. The payment followed a 2008 letter from the South African Football Association to Valcke asking for the money to be deducted for the World Cup budget and sent as a legacy programme to be administered by Warner.</p> \n<p>“It was not Fifa’s money, it was a request from official South African authorities and SAFA,” he said. “As long as it is in line with rules we do it. I don’t understand what’s the problem and why I am such a target in this question.

The belief in a guiding intelligence is hard to shake.</p> \n<p>We know that our conditions of life are deteriorating. Most young people have little prospect of owning a home, or even of renting a decent one. Interesting jobs are sliced up, through <a href=\"http://www.ibiblio.org/eldritch/fwt/taylor.html\">digital Taylorism</a>, into portions of meaningless drudgery. The natural world, whose wonders enhance our lives, and upon which our survival depends, is being rubbed out with horrible speed. Those to whom we look for guardianship, in government and among the economic elite, do not arrest this decline, they accelerate it.</p> \n<p>The political system that delivers these outcomes is sustained by aspiration: the faith that if we try hard enough we could join the elite, even as living standards decline and social immobility becomes set almost in stone. But to what are we aspiring? A life that is better than our own, or worse?</p> \n<p>Last week <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/06/03/the-ten-commandments-for-wall-street-interns/\">a note from an analyst at Barclays’ Global Power and Utilities group in New York was leaked</a>. It addressed students about to begin a summer internship, and offered a glimpse of the toxic culture into which they are inducted.</p> \n<p>“I wanted to introduce you to the 10 Power Commandments … For nine weeks you will live and die by these … We expect you to be the last ones to leave every night, no matter what … I recommend bringing a pillow to the office. It makes sleeping under your desk a lot more comfortable … the internship really is a nine-week commitment at the desk … an intern asked our staffer for a weekend off for a family reunion – he was told he could go. He was also asked to hand in his BlackBerry and pack up his desk … Play time is over and it’s time to buckle up.”</p> \n<p>Play time is over, but did it ever begin? If these students have the kind of parents featured in the Financial Times last month, perhaps not. The article marked a new form of employment: <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4e504c28-f8a4-11e4-be00-00144feab7de.html#axzz3cZfkgQvH\">the nursery consultant</a>. These people, who charge from &pound;290 an hour, must find a nursery that will put their clients’ toddlers on the right track to an elite university.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Mental health beds for children increased by 50%, but still failed to meet demand</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>They spoke of parents who had already decided that their six-month-old son would go to Cambridge then Deutsche Bank, or whose two-year-old daughter “had a tutor for two afternoons a week (to keep on top of maths and literacy) as well as weekly phonics and reading classes, drama, piano, beginner French and swimming. They were considering adding Mandarin and Spanish. ‘The little girl was so exhausted and on edge she was terrified of opening her mouth.’”</p> \n<p>In New York, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/ee988208-ff4b-11e2-aa15-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz3cAaGFiHi\">playdate coaches</a> charging $450 an hour train small children in the social skills that might help secure their admission to the most prestigious private schools. They are taught to hide traits that could suggest they’re on the autistic spectrum, which might reduce their chances of selection.</p> \n<p>From infancy to employment, this is a life-denying, love-denying mindset, informed not by joy or contentment, but by an ambition that is both desperate and pointless, for it cannot compensate for what it displaces: childhood, family life, the joys of summer, meaningful and productive work, a sense of arrival, living in the moment. For the sake of this toxic culture, the economy is repurposed, the social contract is rewritten, the elite is released from tax, regulation and the other restraints imposed by democracy.</p> \n<p>Where the elite goes, we are induced to follow. As if the assessment regimes were too lax in UK primary schools, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2014/mar/27/four-year-olds-compulsory-tests-2016-government-confirms\">last year the education secretary announced a new test for four-year-olds</a>. A primary school in Cambridge has just taken the obvious next step: <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/education/article4464289.ece\">it is now streaming four-year-olds into classes according to perceived ability</a>. The <a href=\"http://services.parliament.uk/bills/2015-16/educationandadoption.html\">education and adoption bill</a>, announced in the Queen’s speech, will turn the screw even tighter. Will this help children, or hurt them?</p> \n<p>Who knows? Governments used to survey the prevalence of children’s mental health issues every five years, but <a href=\"http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmhealth/342/34205.htm\">this ended in 2004</a>. Imagine publishing no figures since 2004 on, say, childhood cancer, and you begin to understand the extent to which successive governments have chosen to avoid this issue. If aspirational pressure is not enhancing our wellbeing but damaging it, those in power don’t want to know.</p> \n<p>But there are hints. <a href=\"http://www.england.nhs.uk/2014/07/10/camhs-report/\">Mental health beds for children in England increased by 50% between 1999 and 2014</a>, but still failed to meet demand. Children suffering mental health crises are being <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-26528396\">dumped in adult wards</a> or even left in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20377493\">police cells</a> because of the lack of provision (put yourself in their position and imagine the impact).</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://news.cision.com/youngminds/r/100-000-children-and-young-people-could-be-hospitalised-due-to-self-harm-by-2020-warns-youngminds,c9194954\">number of children admitted to hospital because of self-harm has risen by 68% in 10 years,</a> while the number of young patients with eating disorders has almost doubled in three years. Without good data, we don’t have a clear picture of what the causes might be, but it’s worth noting that in the past year, according to the charity <a href=\"http://www.youngminds.org.uk/news/blog/2750_english_children_facing_low_self-esteem_and_exam_stress_battles\">YoungMinds, the number of children receiving counselling for exam stress has tripled</a>.</p> \n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.isciweb.org/_Uploads/dbsAttachedFiles/ChildrensWorlds2015-FullReport-Final.pdf\">international survey of children’s wellbeing</a> found that the UK, where such pressures are peculiarly intense, ranked 13th out of 15 countries for children’s life satisfaction, 13th for agreement with the statement “I like going to school”, 14th for children’s satisfaction with their bodies and 15th for self-confidence. So all that pressure and cramming and exhortation – that worked, didn’t it?</p> \n<p>In the cause of self-advancement, we are urged to sacrifice our leisure, our pleasures and our time with partners and children, to climb over the bodies of our rivals and to set ourselves against the common interests of humankind. And then? We discover that we have achieved no greater satisfaction than that with which we began.</p> \n<p>In 1653, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Izaak_Walton\">Izaak Walton described in the Compleat Angler</a> the fate of “poor-rich men”, who “spend all their time first in getting, and next in anxious care to keep it; men that are condemned to be rich, and then always busie or discontented”. Today this fate is confused with salvation.</p> \n<p>Finish your homework, pass your exams, spend your 20s avoiding daylight, and you too could live like the elite. But who in their right mind would want to?</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433863749235/Illustration-by-Andrzej-K-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'But to what are we aspiring?

It’s important to have this in mind.”</p> \n<p>Questioned on CNN about the forthcoming referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union, Miliband said Labour should argue that “even the talk of Britain leaving the European Union is dangerous for Britain, and the reality would be disastrous”.</p> \n<p>He added: “Sitting in New York, it’s completely evident to me that no American government would ever take seriously a Britain that has withdrawn from the European Union.</p> \n<p>“It’s almost like Britain would be resigning from the world.”</p> \n<p>Labour would need to be at the forefront of the campaign to remain in the EU, despite not being in government, he said.</p> \n<p>Contrary to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/08/harriet-harman-casts-doubt-over-ed-milibands-economic-credibility\">assertion this week by acting leader Harriet Harman</a> that some Labour voters had been “relieved” that the party was not in government, Miliband told CNN he thought there was a “profound sense of shock and disappointment in Labour ranks”.</p> \n<p>And he implied that Labour under his brother’s stewardship had not been trusted on the economy, saying the party “needs to catch up with the way Britain has changed, the way politics has changed, and the kind of agenda that needs to be set in an age of economic insecurity”.</p> \n<p>But Miliband stopped short of criticising his brother directly, telling the Times: “Of course it’s doubly painful for me because it’s my brother.
