offering the clearest picture yet of the breadth and depth of the heir to the throne’s lobbying at the highest level of politics.</p> \n<p>The 27 memos, sent in 2004 and 2005 and released only after the Guardian won its long freedom of information fight with the government, show the Prince of Wales making direct and persistent policy demands to the <a

figures in his Labour government.</p> \n<p>From Blair, Charles demanded everything from urgent action to improve equipment for <a

Iraq 'without necessary resources'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a single letter in February 2005, he <a

tuberculosis – damning its opponents as “intellectually dishonest”; lobbied for his preferred person to be appointed to crack down on the mistreatment of farmers by supermarkets; proposed his own aide to brief Downing Street on the design of new hospitals; and urged Blair to tackle a European Union directive limiting the use of herbal alternative medicines use in the UK.</p> \n<p>The government has spent more than &pound;400,000 on legal costs in its ultimately failed attempt to block the original <a

In 2012 the then attorney general, Dominic Grieve, warned they “would be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2013/jul/09/prince-charles-letters-mps-private-court\">seriously damaging to his role as future monarch</a> because, if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is king”.</p> \n<p>But following the release of the “black spider” memos – so-called because of the prince’s scrawled handwriting – there were questions on Wednesday about whether it was worth the money to try to keep secret details of his lobbying, some of which reflects Charles’s very narrow personal interests. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/prince-charles-letter-tony-blair-postpone-herbal-medicines-restrictions\">Did Prince Charles's letter lead Tony Blair to postpone herbal medicines law?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For example, in October 2004 he told the environment minister Elliot Morley he hoped “illegal fishing of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/prince-charles-black-spider-memos-stranger-topics-badgers-patagonian-toothfish\">Patagonian toothfish</a> will be high up on your list of priorities because until that trade is stopped, there is little hope for the poor old albatross”.<br /></p> \n<p>But they also cover more controversial subjects. In one memo, Charles explicitly lobbied Tony Blair when he was prime minister to replace Lynx military helicopters.</p> \n<p>Charles complained that delays in their replacement was “one more example where our Armed forces are being asked to do an extremely challenging job (particularly in Iraq) without the necessary resources”. Blair responded that replacement would be a priority for spending.</p> \n<p>He directly urged the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/live/2015/may/13/publication-of-the-prince-charles-black-spider-letters-live#block-555386f5e4b03e21263ee65f\">health secretary, John Reid</a>, to accelerate redevelopment at a hospital site in Sunderland in which his own architecture charity was involved, warning bluntly that “chickens will come home to roost” in Reid’s government department if action was not taken.<br /></p> \n<p>The letters revealed not only that ministers often responded actively to his suggestions but they appeared to hold his interventions in high regard.</p> \n<p>Blair replied to him in one letter: “I always value and look forward to your views – but perhaps particularly on agricultural topics.”</p> \n<p>After Charles Clarke, then education secretary, responded to Charles’ complaint about the nutritional content of school meals, he signed off: “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/humble-and-obedient-how-ministers-defied-etiquette-in-replies-to-charles\">I have the honour to be, Sir, Your Royal Highness’s most humble and obedient servant</a>.”</p> \n<p>The memos also reveal how dogged Charles can be in demanding actions from ministers as it emerged that his engagement with key political players has not abated. Since the beginning of 2010, the prince held 87 meetings with ministers, opposition party leaders and top government officials, new figures release by the campaign group Republic showed. This year he has held meetings with, among others, David Cameron, the Scottish National party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, and Alistair Carmichael, then Scotland secretary.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456719226__\n</div> \n<p>The letters emerged amid growing signs that Prince Charles is planning to rule in a far more outspoken way than the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/queen-meddling-monarchs-prince-charles\">taciturn Queen</a>. Allies told the Guardian last year he planned “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2014/nov/19/becoming-king-not-silence-prince-charles-allies\">heartfelt interventions</a>” in national life, while in 2013 his friend and biographer Jonathan Dimbleby said: “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2013/nov/13/prince-charles-65-heir-king-revolution\">A quiet constitutional revolution is afoot</a>.”</p> \n<p>But this is likely to be the only glimpse the British public gets of Charles’ correspondence with ministers. Since the original Guardian request to see the letters the government has tightened up the Freedom of Information Act to provide an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/12/prince-charles-black-spider-memos-letters-published\">“absolute exemption” on all requests relating to the Queen</a> and the heir to the throne. </p> \n<p>Paul Flynn, a Labour MP and member of the political and constitutional reform committee, said the letters lifted the lid on the activity of the “the lobbyist supreme in the land”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/13/prince-keeps-his-fists-in-a-velvet-gloves-but-does-not-pull-his-punches\">Prince keeps his fists in velvet gloves – but does not pull his punches</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“They show he is putting forward a whole variety of views – including many bad science views and others that should have no more weight than the man down the pub,” he said. “We can see his views were given a seriousness and priority they did not deserve.”</p> \n<p>Prince Charles was said to be “disappointed” the principle of confidentiality had not been maintained, and his spokeswoman said publication “can only inhibit his ability to express the concerns and suggestions which have been put to him in the course of his travels and meetings”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/ng-interactive/2015/may/13/read-the-prince-charles-black-spider-memos-in-full\">Read the Prince Charles 'black spider' memos in full</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But aides argue the letters do not show the prince engaging in matters of party political contention, implying they do not breach the principle of political neutrality.</p> \n<p>“The letters published by the government show the Prince of Wales expressing concern about issues that he has raised in public,” his spokeswoman said. “In all these cases, the Prince of Wales is raising issues of public concern, and trying to find practical ways to address the issues.”</p> \n<p>But the Guardian’s editor-in-chief, Alan Rusbridger, said: “We fought this case because we believed – and the most senior judges in the country agreed – that the royal family should operate to the same degrees of transparency as anyone else trying to make their influence felt in public life.

In addition to the seven confirmed dead in the crash on Tuesday night, more than 200 were injured.</p> \n<p>The speed limit on the curve where the train crashed is 50mph. Michael Nutter, the Philadelphia mayor, said the train’s apparent 106mph speed as it approached was “just insane” and “astounding, devastating”. </p> \n<p>On Wednesday night the driver was named in media reports as Brandon Bostian, said to be aged 32. The Reuters news agency, quoting a city official on condition of anonymity, described Bostian as a University of Missouri graduate with a business degree who had been an Amtrak engineer for more than four years and a conductor prior to that. The engineer was among those hurt in the wreck.</p> \n<p>ABC News reported Bostian’s lawyer as saying his client had no memory of the crash itself and “no explanation” for what happened, but was co-operating with authorities and had voluntarily turned over a blood sample and his cellphone.</p> \n<p>Bostian recalled driving the train to the area of the crash generally, then later getting tossed around, regaining consciousness and finding his bag and cellphone before dialing 911, the lawyer told the network.<br /></p> \n<p>ABC quoted the attorney as saying Bostian had “no health issues to speak of” before the wreck and was not on any medications. The engineer sustained a concussion and a gash to his head that required 14 staples, the lawyer told ABC. Bostian was treated for his injuries at Einstein Medical Center and released, a hospital spokesman said.</p> \n<p>NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said investigators planned to interview the engineer after a day or two, once he had had time for convalesce.</p> \n<p>Sumwalt said data from the “black box” recorder would be analyzed, along with video footage from forward-facing cameras attached to the train, as well as myriad other aspects including the condition of the tracks and signaling equipment, and the training and performance of the five-person crew.</p> \n<p>The crash seemed likely to heighten moves to expand a system known as positive train control, or PTC, designed to prevent high-speed derailments. No such system was in effect at the site of the Amtrak crash, officials said.</p> \n<p>“We feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred,” Sumwalt said.</p> \n<p>Positive train control automatically slows or even halts trains moving too fast or heading into a danger zone. Under current law the rail industry must adopt the technology by year-end. </p> \n<h2>‘A lot of folks got banged up’</h2> \n<p>The city should have been a pass-through for most passengers aboard the Amtrak Northeast Regional Service train 188 between Washington DC and New York city. <br /></p> \n<p>Yet the trip, made by about 22 Amtrak trains on a normal day, ended up sending 136 patients to hospitals in the region, including dozens to Temple University hospital, where Dr Herbert E Cushing is chief medical officer.</p> \n<p>“There are a lot of folks that got banged up when they rattled around,” Cushing said of patients tossed inside train cars who came to Temple, a level one trauma centre.</p> \n<p>Late on Wednesday 23 patients in mostly stable condition remained at Temple. Eight patients were in critical condition, three awaited surgeries that evening and most had left the hospital after treatment. Two patients were sent home on Wednesday morning.</p> \n<p>The scant “good news” in the aftermath of the crash was the relative lack of head injuries, according to Cushing. </p> \n<p>As of Wednesday afternoon the hospital was only beginning to restabilise from the deadly derailment. The crush of ambulances carrying train crash victims had ended hours earlier. </p> \n<p>Most media moved from one press conference to the next in swarms, while some reporters remained stationed near the wreckage.</p> \n<p>Outside the hospital a worker told the Guardian she was “proud of her team,” but declined to identify herself as she was not authorised to speak to media. <br /></p> \n<p>Most hospital workers, who ate lunch or smoked outside the hospital, avoided journalists.</p> \n<p>Many of the patients at Temple University were not from Philadelphia, and some had even come from outside the US. Patients from Albania, Belgium, Germany, India and Spain were brought to Temple, Cushing said.</p> \n<p>Four Amtrak officials were stationed at the hospital to help victims from outside Philadelphia figure out a way to get home.</p> \n<p>One patient, suffering massive chest injuries from the crash, died at the hospital. James Marshall Gaines III, a 48-year-old from Princeton, New Jersey, is one passenger who has been named. Authorities worked through the day to notify families of victims.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c979baf0590f5c12927e4d03ad772ab1a7fdd566\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431549361407/5f2ccd7d-8962-4179-ab3a-d434ed39978b-289x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Associated Press employee Jim Gaines pictured on 7 September 2006.\" width=\"289\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Associated Press employee James Gaines pictured on 7 September 2006.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Santos Chaparro/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Gaines, a father-of-two who worked for the Associated Press, was returning home after attending meetings in Washington.

She joins the contest alongside Chuka Umunna, Liz Kendall and Andy Burnham, who also announced his candidacy on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>In an <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/yvette-cooper-standing-labour-leadership-5693661\">article for the Daily Mirror</a>, Cooper pledged to make life better for families as she declared her bid to replace Ed Miliband, with the new leader to be announced at a special conference on 12 September.</p> \n<p>Following last week’s defeat, Cooper said the party had not given voters enough hope going into the general election. The former work and pensions secretary rejected calls to “go back to the remedies of the past” that worked for former prime minister Tony Blair. She said she wanted Labour to “move beyond the old labels of left and right” and be “credible, compassionate, creative and connected to the day-to-day realities of life”. <br /></p> \n<p>She wrote: “In the end, Labour didn’t convince enough people that we had the answers. They liked a lot of what we had to say, about raising the minimum wage, expanding childcare, cutting tax for low-paid workers and banning bad zero-hours contracts. But for many people it wasn’t enough to give them hope and confidence we could match all their ambitions for the future. And when there’s too little hope, optimism or confidence, the politics of anger, fear and division takes over – that’s what the Tories, the SNP and Ukip all exploited and campaigned on in this election. <br /></p> \n<p>“The fracturing of politics reflects the fracturing of our country and our communities. Divided between rich and poor, north and south, city and small town. And it leaves Britain a darker, narrower place. But that’s why Labour needs to be bigger in our appeal, bolder in our ambitions and brighter about the future. <br /></p> \n<p>“Going back to the remedies of the past, of Gordon Brown or Tony Blair, won’t keep up with the way the world has changed. We need a Labour party that moves beyond the old labels of left and right, and focuses four-square on the future. Credible, compassionate, creative, and connected to the day-to-day realities of life.” <br /></p> \n<p>Cooper added: “I don’t want to be the next leader of the Labour party just because there’s a vacancy. I want to make life better for Britain’s families. It isn’t enough to say we can stop bad things happening – we need to show how good we can be for people too.” <br /></p> \n<p>Earlier, in apparent contrast to Cooper, Burnham signalled that he wanted to return the party to the treble election-winning approach adopted under Blair. The former health secretary said he wanted Labour to “speak for everyone and for the whole country” and address voters’ aspirations the way it did in 1997. </p> \n<p>In a video message, Burnham also appeared to take a swipe at potential leadership rival Tristram Hunt, who has spoken of the need for the party to appeal to the “John Lewis couple” who shop in smart department stores, as well as its more traditional supporters. Burnham said: “The party that I love has lost its emotional connection with millions of people. The way to get it back can’t possibly be to choose one group of voters over another – to speak only to people on zero-hour contracts or only to shoppers at John Lewis.” <br /></p> \n<p>Burnham’s announcement came hours after Labour’s national executive committee (NEC) agreed a four-month campaign to find a new leader and deputy leader under the new one-member-one-vote system adopted by the party last year. A deadline of 12 August has been set for members and supporters to sign up to receive a vote in the election. <br /></p> \n<p>Some 30,000 new members have joined in the few days since Miliband’s resignation, and unions are expected to mount an intense drive to encourage thousands of their members to become affiliated Labour supporters in order to have a vote. <br /></p> \n<p>Earlier, Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, dismissed claims that Labour lost the general election because it was too leftwing and said his union would “play its part” in the debate on the party’s future. <br /></p> \n<p>Under the timetable set out by the NEC, the formal election period will open on Friday. The parliamentary Labour party will stage hustings for the leadership contenders on 8 June and for deputy leadership contenders on 9 June when nominations for both posts open. <br /></p> \n<p>Nominations for leader will close at midday on 15 June and for deputy leader at noon on 17 June. Ballot papers will be sent out by post on 14 August and polling will close at noon on 10 September. </p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431551690673/482dc210-3a4b-4822-bc55-0fbc69fc3da5-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ben A Pruchnie/Getty Images","altText":"Yvette Cooper","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ben A Pruchnie/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T21:31:02Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T23:04:19Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":994,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Yvette Cooper","Labour","Labour party leadership","UK news","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/yvette-cooper","webTitle":"Yvette Cooper"},{"id":"politics/labour","webTitle":"Labour"},{"id":"politics/labourleadership","webTitle":"Labour party leadership"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/13/yvette-cooper-announces-candidacy-for-labour-leadership","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48q46","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/13/yvette-cooper-announces-candidacy-for-labour-leadership","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/13/yvette-cooper-announces-candidacy-for-labour-leadership"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431551690673/482dc210-3a4b-4822-bc55-0fbc69fc3da5-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Cooper says she wants Labour to ‘move beyond the old labels of left and right’.

They established the United Nations and agreed a simple set of universal standards of decency for mankind to cling to: the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These standards were intended to protect the individual from the state, to uphold the rights of minorities and to provide support for the vulnerable.</p> \n<p>The idea was simple; these standards would first be enshrined in regional treaties such as the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and then be given legal effect in every country. In the UK this was achieved when Labour enacted the Human Rights Act (HRA) in 1998.</p> \n<p>The incoming Tory government now intends to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/10/conservatives-to-push-forward-on-manifesto-and-scrap-human-rights-act\" title=\"\">strip our people of these universal rights by repealing the HRA</a>. Michael Gove has been appointed as the new justice secretary to lead the assault. In a week when we celebrate VE Day, the irony should not be lost. British politicians, many of them Tory, participated in the drafting of the ECHR in Whitehall because they believed that they were drafting an instrument to reflect the values that we in this country took for granted and which, they thought, vindicated our military triumph.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>No doubt Gove will peddle the myth that the HRA is effectively a villains’ charter. But the evidence is against him</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>No doubt Gove will peddle the usual myth that the HRA is nothing more than a villains’ charter. But the evidence is against him on that. There has been no fundamental shift in defendants’ rights under the HRA, mainly because legislation passed by the Margaret Thatcher government in 1984 set out clear rights for suspects that have been successfully embedded in our law for many years.</p> \n<p>By stark contrast, the HRA has heralded a new approach to the protection of the most vulnerable in our society, including child victims of trafficking, women subject to domestic and sexual violence, those with disabilities and victims of crime. After many years of struggling to be heard, these individuals now have not only a voice, but a right to be protected. The Tory plans to repeal the HRA, together with the restricted access to our courts already brought about by the restriction on judicial review introduced by Gove’s predecessor, Chris Grayling, will silence the vulnerable and leave great swaths of executive action unchecked and unaccountable.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/11/human-rights-reform-michael-gove-justice-secretary\" title=\"\">Gove may try another tack</a>, arguing that the Tories are not against human rights at all, but simply want to keep those pesky judges in the European court at bay. But this argument also unravels quickly. The rights in the ECHR are very simple. They include the right to life, liberty and security of person; the right to a fair trial; protection from torture and ill treatment; freedom of thought, conscience, religion, speech and assembly; the right to marry; the right to free elections; the right to fair access to the country’s education system; and, to top things off, the right not to be discriminated against. Which of these rights would you not want? One of the reasons the much-vaunted Tory “British bill of rights” has never seen the light of day is because any proposal that does not match these basic ECHR rights will be torn to shreds.</p> \n<p>That only leaves Gove with the shallow argument that our courts are shackled because they are bound to follow the decisions of the European court of human rights. But that argument runs into two fundamental problems. First, the HRA only obliges our courts to “take into account” judgments of the European court; they are not bound by them. Second, it is not the HRA that obliges the UK to respond to the judgments of the European court. It is Article 46(1) of the ECHR itself.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/11/human-rights-reform-michael-gove-justice-secretary\">Why human rights reform could trip up Michael Gove | Joshua Rozenberg</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Article 46 states that: “The High Contracting Parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the Court in any case to which they are parties.” The UK signed up to that international obligation when it signed the ECHR in the 1950s. Repealing the HRA would have no effect whatsoever on the UK’s obligations under Article 46. The only way for the Tories to achieve what they want is for the UK to pull out of the ECHR and, as a consequence, out of the Council of Europe.</p> \n<p>That would leave the UK outside the family of nations upholding universal human rights and would hugely diminish our reputation abroad. It would also widen the fracture in our own politics evidenced by last week’s elections. When the bill of rights commission set up by the coalition government in 2012 went to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to find out what they thought of the HRA, they returned to London with a very blunt message ringing in their ears: the plan to repeal the HRA and adopt a British bill of rights is a ridiculous metropolitan Tory idea that should be put back in the box.</p> \n<p>A proposal that deprives people of their rights, divides nations abroad and divides nations at home is a grossly disproportionate reaction to one or two adverse rulings from Strasbourg. It also cuts across the basic fairness, dignity and equality that all nations committed to nearly 70 years ago.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431524469616/Judges-congregate-in-West-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Judges congregate in Westminster Abbey.

The club has the right to change coach if it is not happy.” His hopes of a second successive success, and his fifth final as a coach, fell apart just before the hour thanks to a goal few in Spain seemed to have contemplated.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/13/gareth-bale-defiant-criticism-real-madrid-champions-league\">Gareth Bale defiant over fans’ criticism of Real Madrid’s European exit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Much had been made of the fact that Madrid needed only one goal to overturn the first-leg deficit and progress but that was founded on the premise that Juventus would not score, but score they did. &Aacute;lvaro Morata, who joined Madrid as a 16-year-old, struck the goal on 57 minutes. He did not celebrate out of respect for the club that saw him grow into a player who will now play in his second consecutive European Cup final, one for each of these teams, and perhaps too because there was still much work to do.</p> \n<p>More than half an hour remained during which Juventus knew a Madrid goal would take it to extra time. The time to celebrate would come after that, if Juve could resist, and so they fought as white shirts poured towards them, defenders seemingly multiplying.</p> \n<p>“There was tension; they are an extraordinary team and it is not easy to contain them,” Allegri said. When eventually the end came, Madrid had taken 22 shots but only one had gone in. It had come after 23 minutes and it seemed to set up a comfortable passage to the final. What came next did not seem plausible then.</p> \n<p>Cristiano Ronaldo scored from the penalty spot after James Rodr&iacute;guez fell under challenges from Claudio Marchisio and Giorgio Chiellini. The goal came in front of the south end where before the game a gigantic tarpaulin had depicted Alfredo Di St&eacute;fano, the man who changed this club for ever when he arrived in 1953. It was Ronaldo’s 307th goal for Madrid, equalling Di St&eacute;fano’s record. Only Ra&uacute;l lies before him now and he will be caught in due course.</p> \n<p>The slogan that had accompanied Di St&eacute;fano read “My Real attack” and attack they did. Before the goal, Ronaldo had speared a free-kick just over and Gareth Bale’s long shot was pushed away by Gianluigi Buffon. His had been the first chance too, a header that drifted over after 35 seconds. Juventus’s open approach and their imprecise passing suited Madrid, often confronted by space, not opponents.</p> \n<p>Isco and Ronaldo hit the side-netting, Buffon caught a Karim Benzema header and then made an even sharper save, this time low at his near post.</p> \n<p>Juventus were grateful for the half-time whistle; the game was in danger of slipping away definitively. Instead, they were still in it but only Arturo Vidal had troubled Iker Casillas.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/13/marcelo-juventus-real-madrid\">Marcelo shines but Juventus’ direct approach defeats Real Madrid</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And yet the goal did come. Juventus’s passing did not convince but there was a nervousness about Madrid now, as if they were suddenly aware of their vulnerability. A mistake from Marcelo almost allowed Vidal to feed Morata inside the area and then Sergio Ramos bundled the Chilean over. The free-kick was punched away by Casillas but when the ball came back in Paul Pogba out-jumped Ramos, whose position allowed the players exiting the area to enter it again onside.</p> \n<p>It dropped to Morata near the penalty spot and he controlled and hit a bouncing ball up and through Casillas’s hands into the net. This was different now. Madrid had been preparing a defensive change; now they had to chase the game. As they did so, Juventus could have ended it, Casillas saving from Marchisio one-on-one. And while Madrid sought the goal, ideas were few.</p> \n<p>Bale put one wide before Ronaldo set up a cross from the left which the Welshman leapt to reach at the far post, just a couple of yards out. His header, though, ran across the top of the net.</p> \n<p>The noise rose and the clock ran, not quickly enough for the Italians, too quickly for the Spaniards. Andrea Pirlo was withdrawn for Andrea Barzagli, Juventus shifting to three central defenders with 12 minutes left that promised to be long indeed. Bale hit another one shot wide but real chances were strangely few, the best actually coming for Pogba at the other end.</p> \n<p>The board went up moments later; four minutes, so 94 not 95 long minutes. At 10.38pm on a hot night in Madrid the referee blew his whistle and Juventus’s players leapt into the sky and sprinted across the pitch, en route to Berlin.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/59dad295478604c9dbd8d05ae12722f1c8e820bf/110_39_3846_2309/3846.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2309,"width":3846,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images","altText":"MADRID, SPAIN - MAY 13: Alvaro Morata of Juventus celebrates after scoring during the UEFA Champions League semi final match between Real Madrid CF and Juventus at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu on May 13, 2015 in Madrid, Spain.
