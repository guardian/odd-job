Hundreds of people gathered to pay their respects outside the Emanuel AME Church – the scene of the shooting – on Thursday evening, with more prayer services held throughout Charleston.</p> \n<p>A day after the massacre – labelled a “hate crime” by South Carolina police – a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/dylann-roof-south-carolina-charleston-shooting-suspect\">portrait of Roof as an apparently committed racist</a> is building from interviews with associates of the young man, shown in Facebook photos wearing a jacket bearing the flags of the former white-racist regimes of South Africa and Rhodesia.</p> \n<p>Joseph Meek Jr, a childhood friend who saw Roof the morning of the shooting, said the pair had never discussed race growing up. But when they recently reconnected, Roof told him “blacks were taking over the world [and] someone needed to do something about it for the white race”, he told the Associated Press.</p> \n<p>“He said he wanted segregation between whites and blacks. I said, ‘That’s not the way it should be.’ But he kept talking about it.”</p> \n<p>Meek said that when he woke up on Wednesday morning Roof was at his house, sleeping in his car outside – its license plate bearing the confederate flag. </p> \n<p>Later that day, Meek said he and some friends had gone to a nearby lake but Roof stayed behind, deciding he’d rather see a movie. The next time he saw Roof was in surveillance-camera photos distributed by police in the aftermath of the killing. “I knew it was him,” Meek said.</p> \n<p>A roommate, Dalton Tyler, said Roof had been “planning something like that for six months”. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"745b17044f02598e102e7a68514faaa3f4cbb788\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/745b17044f02598e102e7a68514faaa3f4cbb788/0_59_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An undated handout photo provided by Berkeley County of Dylann Roof.

He said he was going to do something like that and then kill himself.”</p> \n<p>He said Roof had been “on and off” with his parents, but they had previously bought him a gun. He hadn’t been allowed to take it with him until this week, Tyler said.</p> \n<p>Roof’s uncle Carson Cowles said the gun, a .45-caliber pistol, had been a gift for the introverted young man’s 21st birthday.</p> \n<p>“I said he was like 19 years old, he still didn’t have a job, a driver’s license or anything like that and he just stayed in his room a lot of the time,” Cowles said. “I don’t have any words for it. Nobody in my family had seen anything like this coming.”</p> \n<p>A high school contemporary, John Mullins, <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/18/everything-known-about-charleston-church-shooting-suspect-dylann-roof.html\">told the Daily Beast</a>: “He made a lot of racist jokes, but you don’t really take them seriously like that. You don’t really think of it like that.” But now, he said, it seemed that “the things he said were kind of not joking”.</p> \n<p>Richard Cohen, the president of the Southern Poverty Law Center, said Roof was not known to his organisation, which tracks hate crimes across the US, but based on his Facebook page he appeared to be a “disaffected white supremacist”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/charleston-shooting-florist-debbie-dills-hailed-a-hero-after-tailing-suspects-car\">Charleston shooting: florist Debbie Dills hailed a hero after tailing suspect's car</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Others expressed surprise at Roof’s crimes. “I never thought he’d do something like this,” a high school friend, Antonio Metze, told AP. “He had black friends.”<br /></p> \n<p>Meek’s mother, Kimberly Konzny, described him as a “sweet kid”. “He was quiet.

How did one colour come to mean so much? | Hannah Pool</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At this point, I might lean forward, and in whispered tones for effect, share what I call the “crazy rig conversations”.</p> \n<p>“There was this one guy, right – he was just straight out about it,” I say. “He was like, ‘I’m a chauvinist, OK? I’m the last of a dying breed. Let me just say what I want to say!’</p> \n<p>“I’ll tell ya, some of the rest is unrepeatable in good company! Get a bunch of blokes together and anything goes. I reckon I don’t even hear all the good stuff, although they do eventually get used to you.”</p> \n<p>Truth be told, however, that is not the whole picture. In fact, like anything, working as a female in a male-dominated industry is all of the things – challenging, difficult, fun, rewarding, unexpected and above all, completely subjective.</p> \n<p>What is fascinating is how the experience of women in industry reflects the broader expectations of and attitude towards women in our society. There is a general acceptance that gender diversity is a “good” thing, but some occasional reluctance about “forcing” a change, particularly when affirmative action is considered.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Are women the homemakers and the breadwinners? Are men the homemakers?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The broader questions around roles of men and women in society also linger. The traditional norm of men as the breadwinners and women as the homemakers in our society has definitely been challenged, but what does the alternative look like? Are women the homemakers <em>and</em> the breadwinners? Are men the homemakers? What does this say about our construction of masculinity and femininity? There are more questions than there are answers, and being in an industry with mostly men, it is fascinating to see the dynamics play out.</p> \n<p>There are generational differences in the ideologies and this also varies based on industry, location (in the field or in the office) and education level (management versus engineers versus operators). Interestingly, it doesn’t play out like you would expect.</p> \n<p>A recent conversation with a young engineer who started in the mining industry brought this to the fore.</p> \n<p>“I’ve had a great time!” she said, almost in surprise. “I was expecting it to be rough and the men to be mean, but they’ve all taken care of me and shown me around.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, quite often there can be advantages to being a woman in a male-dominated industry. People know who you are, you will always be remembered (which is a double edged sword) and the lads, particularly the operators, enjoy talking to a woman, particularly after being around only blokes for weeks on end. The older generations of men in the field (the baby boomers) are often happy to take on the role of “teacher” for a younger female, so a lot can be learnt. The younger men (gen Y) have grown up in a world where they have been told men and women are generally equal, and accept that as the status quo.</p> \n<p>However, as we see in other industries, those benefits don’t necessarily trickle up, and there are still some structural and societal barriers that make it difficult for women. Scratching beneath the surface allows the unconscious bias to become evident. Taking the case of engineers, for example, it can be argued that female engineers are often highly visible as women, but invisible as engineers. There is an acceptance in equality but not always a true belief in it.</p> \n<p>It may be the baby boomer is happy to teach but finds it difficult to accept direction from a younger female until she has proven her worth beyond all doubt. It may be the residual resentment in the young male engineers that a female engineer is more sought after by a company with a diversity policy. Those biases are more difficult to challenge and reflect the broader societal attitudes that are yet to change.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dce7967c5e5edc63f6e54ca60cfd57d95d6e6b5e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dce7967c5e5edc63f6e54ca60cfd57d95d6e6b5e/27_0_513_619/414.jpg\" alt=\"Yassmin Abdel-Magied: life on an oil rig\" width=\"414\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yassmin Abdel-Magied: life on an oil rig</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: yassmin_a/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some of the structural barriers are simply due to the nature of the industry which has been designed around men, due to its history. Whether that is because it’s seen as difficult to hold down a Fifo roster while pregnant or with young children, or that many time-consuming and demanding project management roles are given to engineers at a time when many women are having kids and may not necessarily have the support at home, some male-dominated workplaces are, unsurprisingly, still designed around men. </p> \n<p>It is not all doom and gloom however. Times are changing, and are changing more rapidly than ever. </p> \n<p>There are more and more examples of “non-traditional” families, where duties are shared and unusual support networks created. There are more women entering the science, technology, engineering and maths spaces, although there should be more. There are more companies with obvious diversity policies and that encourage women and cater to their needs.

The German leader Angela Merkel, French president Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande and Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras agreed to stage an emergency EU summit on Monday as a last critical attempt to prevent Greece going bankrupt. A representative of the European Central Bank told the meeting it was unsure whether Greek banks would have the funds to be able to open on Monday.</p> \n<p>As thousands of pro-EU protestors gathered outside the Athens parliament building, leaders of the eurozone and the International Monetary Fund aimed bitter criticism at the leftwing Greek government, accusing it of lying to its own people, misrepresenting and misleading other EU leaders, refusing to negotiate seriously, and taking Greece to the brink of catastrophe.</p> \n<p>The Luxembourg talks broke down within an hour of discussions about the Greek crisis starting, indicating the bad blood between both sides. Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, said there was an urgent need for dialogue “with adults in the room”. She added: “We can only arrive at a resolution if there is a dialogue. Right now we’re short of a dialogue.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457210231__\n</div> \n<p>Lagarde has taken a tough line on debt talks with Athens over the past four months, since the radical leftist Syriza government took control and insisted creditors drop proposals for further austerity as the price of releasing the last tranche of bailout funds. At the talks in Luxembourg she reportedly introduced herself to Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis as “the criminal in chief”, in reference to Tsipras’s claim earlier this week that the IMF bore “criminal responsibility” for the situation in Greece.</p> \n<p>Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic affairs, who has been more sympathetic to the Greek case, said: “There’s not much time to avoid the worst.” He appealed to the Tsipras government to return to the negotiating table, making it plain that Athens has been treating its creditors and EU partners with contempt. He said Athens had made no credible counter-proposals on the bailout terms and said that Varoufakis tabled no new proposals on Thursday, despite the session of Eurogroup finance ministers being billed as the last chance to secure a deal sending Greece a financial lifeline and keeping it in the euro. He called on the Greek government “to avoid a fate that would be catastrophic”.</p> \n<p>The current bailout for Greece expires on 30 June when Athens is also due to repay the IMF around €1.6bn. Lagarde said if the payment is not made on time, Greece will be declared to be in default and would disqualify itself from receiving any further IMF funds.</p> \n<p>Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister and president of the eurogroup, said: “No agreement is yet in sight.”</p> \n<p>Varoufakis reiterated demands for debt relief as part of a deal. The creditors concede that this could be agreed in the future, but that first Greece has to meet the terms of the present rescue package which expires in 11 days. “We are dangerously close to a state of mind that accepts an accident,” said Varoufakis.</p> \n<p> As the talks quickly broke down in Luxembourg, in Brussels, Donald Tusk, the president of the European council, promptly convened an emergency leaders’ summit on Monday evening, putting the onus on both Merkel and Tsipras as the two key leaders to bend towards concessions to clinch a deal.</p> \n<p>A senior EU official taking part in the meeting told the Guardian that Monday’s summit was convened as soon as EU leaders learned of the collapse of the Luxembourg talks. The spectre of a Greek banking collapse under the weight of withdrawals prompted the meet, he said. </p> \n<p>The standoff is over what actions Greece has to take to access the remaining €7.2bn in bailout funds.</p> \n<p>Dijsselbloem made plain that even if agreement is reached in the end, the rescue package would need to be extended beyond 30 June, as there simply was not enough time left to negotiate the fine print and get through the parliamentary procedures needed in several eurozone countries.</p> \n<p>At issue is just a €2bn financing gap between what the Greeks are prepared to offer and what the creditors are demanding, but the problem goes deeper into questions of power and rules. Dijsselbloem said any deal that might be reached would need to maintain the credibility of the eurozone as a rules-based community.</p> \n<p> As the meeting degenerated into rancour, Greek banks stood on the brink of collapse after a flood of cash withdrawals on Thursday, raising the prospect of capital controls and temporary bank closures. The five major commercial banks saw around €2bn of deposits withdrawn by customers anxious that Greece was nearing the end of its credit line with lenders and about to go bust.</p> \n<p> Dijsselbloem demanded that the Greek government act quickly to restore trust and stem the haemorrhaging of deposits. “It’s a sign of great concern for the future,” he said. “It can be dealt with, but it requires quick action.”</p> \n<p> Top officials from the European Central Bank told the meeting that Greece might need to impose capital controls within days. They said the banks would be open on Friday. “On Monday, I don’t know,” Benoit Coeure from the ECB board was said to have told the ministers.</p> \n<p>The precarious situation, which has previously forced the ECB to regularly increase its credit line to Greek banks, formed the backdrop to intense negotiations between Athens and the troika of creditors – the European commission, the International Monetary Fund and the ECB.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457203217__\n</div> \n<p>Lagarde said there would be “no grace period or possibility of delay” to loan payments that are due on 30 June. The hardening of the IMF’s stance follows an admission by the debt-stricken Greek government on Wednesday that it would be unable to pay without a deal with Brussels and the IMF to provide extra funds.</p> \n<p>Lagarde said the Syriza administration would need to make further reforms to its pension system to get a deal, something prime minister Tsipras has refused to countenance.</p> \n<p>Writing in German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel, Tsipras said pensioners had become the main breadwinners in many families, meaning cuts in pension payments would increase poverty.</p> \n<p>“Traditionally, this solidarity has meant that young people, through their contributions, fund the pensions of their parents,” he said.</p> \n<p>“But during the Greek crisis, we’ve witnessed this solidarity being reversed as the parents’ pensions fund the survival of their children.”</p> \n<p>But the IMF and Brussels want further cuts to bring down the cost of pensions, which account for 16% of GDP, with further restrictions on early retirement and lower supplementary pension payments.</p> \n<p>The Greek government has maintained, throughout five months of talks, that it remains ready to join talks to secure an agreement, but could not accept the current proposals to cut pensions or the insistence it achieve a 1% budget surplus in the middle of a recession.</p> \n<p>Chief negotiator, Euclid Tsakalotos, warned on the BBC’s Today programme on Radio 4 that “if Greece goes out, the euro might break down.” He said: “Once one country has left, you change a monetary union into a fixed exchange rate system, where it’s a cost-benefit analysis whether another country leaves.</p> \n<p>“My greatest fear is that the breakup of the euro will return [us] to the competitive devaluations, and the nationalisms, and the kind of politics we had in the 1930s. If we don’t [have a deal], we have to go to the Greek people, because we have no mandate to leave the euro, and that would be a very bad eventuality.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434662293333/43300b83-aef3-46e2-9668-568ba7f0c242-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Francois

France-Presse","body":"<p> French actor Julie Gayet appeared for the first time on Thursday at an official event attended by President Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande, amid speculation that she is being gradually introduced as the nation’s new first lady.</p> \n<p>Gayet, 43, dressed all in black, stepped out at a ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of a famous wartime address by Gen Charles de Gaulle.</p> \n<p>Hollande, 60, split with his long-term girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler last year after revelations that he was having an affair with Gayet.</p> \n<p>Arriving shortly before Hollande at the ceremony at Mont Valerien, on the western edge of Paris, Gayet was seen pushing the wheelchair of her grandfather, Alain Gayet, a decorated hero of the French resistance.</p> \n<p>The ceremony marked the anniversary of De Gaulle’s historic radio address from London on 18 June, 1940, urging French citizens to resist German occupation.</p> \n<p>Accompanied by her father Brice, Gayet stayed discreetly at the back throughout as Hollande shook hands with the former resistance fighters.</p> \n<p>The presidency insisted it was a coincidence that Gayet was at the event. “There was no strategy on our part,” an advisor to Hollande said, saying the actor attended the ceremony in her capacity as the granddaughter of a decorated resistance fighter.</p> \n<p>The surprise appearance came as society magazine Paris Match splashed the headline “Julie Gayet comes into the light” on its front cover, reporting on Thursday the actor was set to “enter her new role little by little” as Hollande’s official partner.</p> \n<p>In April, celebrity magazine Voici printed photos of the two walking together at La Lanterne, the president’s residence at Versailles outside Paris, alongside some old friends of Hollande.</p> \n<p>The same magazine had in November published pictures of the two together inside the Elysee presidential residence, prompting five staff members to be reassigned over what constituted a damaging security breach.</p> \n<p>Repeatedly asked in recent months about the status of his relationship with Gayet amid huge speculation in the tabloids, Hollande has neither confirmed nor denied that the pair are still together, saying he has a right to have his privacy respected.</p> \n<p>Paparazzi photos in January 2014 of Hollande in a scooter helmet, visiting Gayet at a Paris apartment, set off an international media firestorm. </p> \n<p>Trierweiler, a journalist, published a bestselling tell-all memoir of their subsequent breakup, portraying the president as a cold-hearted egotist and champagne socialist who was contemptuous of the “toothless” poor.</p> \n<p>The president has four children with another former partner, the current ecology minister

Royal.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f9e93eba6531a01b36ab0805f373d0db13af5b92/0_0_4076_2448/4076.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2448,"width":4076,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Thomas

This year, he has trebled that number.</p> \n<p>Fifteen years to the day since Woods won the US Open by 15 shots, he topped a three-wood from the middle of the 18th fairway at Chambers Bay into the deepest bunker on the course. Already nine over par, his hopes of breaking 80 suddenly vanished. He has rarely looked so dejected, so beaten, so incapable of the rousing return for which many golfing fans long. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/henrik-stenson-dustin-johnson-us-open\">Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson rise above mishaps to lead US Open</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This has become painful viewing, which leaves onlookers to wonder just how Woods truly feels about his sharp demise. For all he has been adamant that more competitive play is the key to improved performance, the 14-time major winner is suffering embarrassment after embarrassment in front of the watching world. Cole Hammer, a 15-year-old amateur, outscored Woods by three here. </p> \n<p>After what seems an inevitable missed cut on the outskirts of Seattle, it would be no real surprise if Woods opts to take another break from tournament play. Despite his positive comment to the contrary, there is no evidence whatsoever that Woods can threaten, let alone dominate, leaderboards. Woods has more rounds in the 80s during this season than the 60s. Some form of reassessment is required. </p> \n<p>Prior to Thursday, his highest-scoring single US Open round was 77; that was as an amateur in 1996. Chambers Bay witnessed the fourth highest round of Woods’s professional career. To his credit, and in a departure from what plenty others would do in the same lamentable scenario, a sanguine Woods faced the media thereafter. He had just produced a back nine of 41. </p> \n<p>“I’m not very happy, that’s for sure,” said the 39-year-old. “It was a tough day. I got off to a bad start and then just couldn’t quite get it turned around.</p> \n<p>“It’s one of those things, just got to work through it. I’m trying as hard as I can to do it, and for some reason I just can’t get the consistency that I’d like to have out there.</p> \n<p>“I fought, I fought hard. And that was my number. I couldn’t grind out any harder than that. So that’s just the way I played and unfortunately it was a high number today.”</p> \n<p>Woods admitted this is as challenging a period as he has ever encountered. His solution? “Keep working. Keep grinding and keep working.”</p> \n<p>The 13th hole at Chambers Bay has the widest fairway in US Open history; Woods missed it. He triple bogeyed the 14th. Earlier, at the 8th, his club flew into the air from his hands as he played from wild rough. The 16th witnessed his solitary birdie. </p> \n<p>There was also a smile. If Woods’s score wasn’t a shock, the 81 of Rickie Fowler, one of his playing partners, certainly was. “The bright side is, at least I kicked Rickie’s butt today,” Woods said. That sense of humour has never been more necessary. </p> \n<p>Fowler has been the model of recent major championship consistency and was many people’s tip to claim this event. Barring something astonishing, he won’t survive for the weekend. Only one player, a club professional named Rich Berberian, scored worse on day one than Fowler.</p> \n<p>Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson shared the lead at five under par 65. Patrick Reed lies a shot adrift.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/82b691e5dc926d147a3df7473be9d4d868a07ed1/0_108_4928_2957/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2957,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Harry How/Getty Images","altText":"A frustrating day at the office for Tiger Woods","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Harry How/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T03:54:11Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T08:08:40Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":87,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewan Murray","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/26/1401131130466/Ewan-Murray-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewanmurray"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["US Open Golf 2015","US Open","PGA Tour","US sports","Golf","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/us-open-golf-2015","webTitle":"US Open Golf 2015"},{"id":"sport/usopengolf","webTitle":"US Open"},{"id":"sport/pga-tour","webTitle":"PGA Tour"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/golf","webTitle":"Golf"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ewan Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ewanmurray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/us-open-day-one-tiger-woods","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avk7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/19/us-open-day-one-tiger-woods","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/19/us-open-day-one-tiger-woods"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/82b691e5dc926d147a3df7473be9d4d868a07ed1/0_108_4928_2957/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2957,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tiger Woods reacts to a shot from the rough on the eighth hole during the first round of the 115th U.S. Open Championship at Chambers Bay.

The arrangement was approved by an acquaintance of Totti who is to go on trial this year on unrelated charges of corruption.</p> \n<p>Luca Odevaine, a senior local authority official, is accused of being a pivotal figure in a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/07/june-29-co-operative-italy-rome\">web of corrupt links </a>between the Rome council and an organised crime syndicate headed by a former neo-fascist gunman.</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion the deal between Totti’s firm and the council is illegal. And, since the footballer does not wield executive powers in the company, he may have been unaware of the contents of the agreement when it was signed. But several factors have made it intensely controversial.</p> \n<p>The origins of the affair go back to 2005 when the council approved the creation of a network of temporary housing assistance centres.</p> \n<p>Documents reproduced in a recently published book, I re di Roma (the king of Rome), by Lirio Abbate and Marco Lillo, show that two years later Odevaine was made chairman of a committee tasked with deciding on offers of suitable buildings for the scheme.</p> \n<p>Totti and the official already knew one another. When Odevaine’s father died in 2005, Totti, his wife and his personal trainer and assistant put their names to a notice in the daily L’Unita expressing their condolences.</p> \n<p>Among the offers Odevaine’s committee received was one from Immobiliare Dieci, part of a chain of companies controlled by Totti and all bearing names that refer to the No 10 shirt he wears on the field. His firm proposed the upper storeys of a converted office block in Tor Tre Teste, a dormitory suburb on the desolate outskirts of Rome, and proposed an annual rent of almost €1.3m (&pound;930,000).</p> \n<p>The building has 35 apartments covering 2,430 square metres, so the suggested rent was equivalent to almost €44 per square metre per month. The committee replied that it would pay €15 per square metre per month in rent. With VAT and a recent 6% increase, the total comes to more than €19 per square metre per month.</p> \n<p>Yet, according to the specialist property website <a href=\"http://www.immobiliare.it/prezzi-mq/Lazio/Roma.html?fkContratto=2\">Immobiliare.it</a>, rents in the 00155 post code area in which the building is situated are among the lowest in Rome at around €10 per square metre per month. In fact, the only parts of the capital where rents exceed €19 are in the city’s historic centre. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.immobiliare.it/prezzi-mq/Lazio/CAP_00184-Roma\">website’s estimates</a> suggest the council could put the homeless into accommodation overlooking the Colosseum for much the same rent it is handing over to Totti’s company.</p> \n<p>In addition to the rent, the local authority is paying more than €350,000 a year for services including taking care of the common areas, 24-hour porterage, maintenance and the cleaning of apartments when there is a change of tenant.</p> \n<p>But Elisa Ferri, who lives in the building with her husband and three children, says conditions are frequently squalid. “A pipe burst in the floor above and it took more than a month to get a plumber to come round,” she said. In the meantime, paint had peeled off the ceiling, water dripped on to her children’s beds and mould formed in several areas.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, the 33-year-old <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://tv.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/03/07/residence-topaia-di-totti-inquilini-contratto-milionario-per-vivere-in-tugurio/346566/\">showed the damage to a video reporter</a> from the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano. </p> \n<p>Ferri, who said she earned €700 a month as a cleaner and carer, told the Guardian the office block was never intended to be inhabited around the clock and that it was plagued by cockroaches. “We have asked several times for disinfestation, but without getting any response,” she said. “I find the cockroaches more repulsive than the mould.”</p> \n<p>The Roma captain declined to respond to questions put to him by the Guardian through his personal trainer and assistant. In March, he also <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.la7.it/servizio-pubblico/video/il-residence-der-pupone-20-03-2015-150363\">refused to give a response to a reporter</a> from the television programme Servizio Pubblico who asked him about his relationship with Odevaine. A representative said merely: “Totti is a footballer. His professional advisers take care of these things.”</p> \n<p>Prosecutors claim Odevaine received €5,000 a month to procure lucrative public contracts for an organised crime syndicate, which – Italy’s highest court has ruled – used mafia-like methods in its operations. In March, Odevaine voluntarily testified to the prosecutors. Reports based on his lawyer’s account of the closed-door proceedings quoted Odevaine as saying the money was compensation for his role as the gang’s “facilitator” and “problem tackler” in the local authority.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Totti in Rome is untouchable, because Totti is Totti</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Ignazio Marino, mayor of Rome</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> The charismatic Totti, 38, has captained AS Roma continuously since 1998, becoming the most prolific goalscorer in the history of the club. A revered figure in his native city – his nicknames include that of <em>Il re di Roma</em> or “the king of Rome” – he has patronised many good causes. He is a goodwill ambassador for the Italian branch of Unicef.</p> \n<p> When the mayor of the Italian capital, Ignazio Marino, was asked about his council’s dealings with the footballer’s companies in March, he replied: “Totti in Rome is untouchable, because Totti is Totti. I want him to carry on winning and scoring …” </p> \n<p> Ownership of the property has since been transferred to Immobiliare Ten, a wholly owned subsidiary of Immobiliare Dieci, which is in turn owned by a firm called Numberten Srl. Totti has an 83.19% stake in Numberten Srl, with the remaining share divided between Totti’s mother, Fiorella Marrozzini, and his brother, Riccardo, who is also Immobiliare Ten’s chief executive. In the four years to the end of 2014 Immobiliare Ten made after-tax profits of €573,996.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434629909294/d094b4b5-e030-4512-9524-2540b40117d1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Xinhua /Barcroft Media","altText":"Francesco Totti of AS Roma and his wife Ilary Blasi.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Xinhua /Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T03:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T03:54:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"John Hooper","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/johnhooper"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Italy","Football","Europe","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/italy","webTitle":"Italy"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"John Hooper","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/johnhooper"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/football-star-flats-homeless-housing-francesco-totti-rome","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49jf2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/19/football-star-flats-homeless-housing-francesco-totti-rome","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/football-star-flats-homeless-housing-francesco-totti-rome"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434629909294/d094b4b5-e030-4512-9524-2540b40117d1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Francesco Totti, captain of AS Roma, and his wife Ilary Blasi.
