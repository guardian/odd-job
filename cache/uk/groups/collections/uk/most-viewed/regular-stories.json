In the case of 100 teachers asked to strike, the action would only be lawful if at least 50 teachers voted and 40 of them backed the strike.</p> \n<p>The double threshold would have to be met in any strike called in health, education, fire, transport, border security and energy sectors – including the Border Force and nuclear decommissioning.</p> \n<p>In further changes, Javid will:</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Require all unions, not just those affiliated to Labour, to ask each existing union member whether they wish to pay the political levy and then repeat the question every five years. The &pound;25m annual political fund income from 4.5 million political levy payers funds a wide range of political campaigning including being a chief source of funding for Labour.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Propose that unlawful or intimidatory picketing should become a criminal as opposed to civil offence and new protections should be available for those workers unwilling to strike. A named official will be required to be available at all times to the police to oversee the picket including the numbers on the line, currently set at six, in an existing code of conduct.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Compel unions to renew any strike mandate with a fresh ballot within four months of the first ballot and give employers the right to hire strike-breaking agency staff as well as require a union to give the employer at least a fortnight’s notice before the industrial action starts.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Empower the government to set a limit on the proportion of working time any public sector worker can spend on trade union duties.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Give the government certification officer powers to fine trade unions as much as &pound;20,000 for breaches of reporting rules including an annual audit on its protests and pickets. The certification officer will also have power to initiate investigations and will in future be funded by a joint levy of unions and employers<br /></p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Require a clear description of the trade dispute and the planned industrial action on the ballot paper, so that all union members are clear what they are voting for.</p> \n<p>The number of working days lost due to strikes was 704,000 in the 12 months to April 2015, but this is a far cry from the near 13m days lost through strike action on average in the 70s, the heyday of union militancy.</p> \n<p>The government says it feels forced to act due to the number of strikes called on the London underground, railways or in schools based on small turnouts or two-year-old ballot mandates.</p> \n<p>The leader of the train drivers’ union Aslef, Mick Whelan, has already likened the attack on union rights as resonant of fascist Germany.</p> \n<p>Paul Kenny, the GMB general secretary, warned the reforms would poison industrial relations in the UK since they removed all incentives for employers to heed their own workers and settle disputes. He said: “When workers jump through draconian hurdles for their vote for strike action to be lawful, the employers can then ignore the will of their own workers. Workers will have to give employers 14 days’ notice of strike action. That is more than enough time for employers to legally hire another workforce to break the strike.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/13/frances-ogrady-tuc-my-members-real-wealth-creators\">Frances O’Grady: ‘My members are the wealth creators, but don’t get a fair share’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The changes to the current system of contracting out of paying the political levy are also likely to be equally controversial since there had been an unwritten understanding at Westminster that no party would introduce partisan reforms to party funding without cross party consensus.</p> \n<p>Repeated attempts, notably by the former Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg, to reach cross party consensus on funding reform foundered when the Conservatives refused to accept a new lower individual donation cap and Labour resisted major changes to the political levy.</p> \n<p>The Javid plans, which were not clearly set out in the Conservative manifesto, are likely to blow a hole in Labour party funding because the number of union members who will proactively support paying the political levy will be much lower than those who pay the political levy through inertia.</p> \n<p>Kenny said: “It is clear the Tory party high command intend to make the Labour party bankrupt by cutting off the main source of funding that they have relied on since the 1930s. This is aimed at undermining political campaigning by unions on behalf of their members and communities.”</p> \n<p>He said the proposals were one sided since there were no parallel proposals to insert more democratic requirements on company donations to parties.</p> \n<p>Javid said: “Trade unions have a constructive role to play in representing their members’ interests but our one-nation government will balance their rights with those of working people and business.</p> \n<p>“These changes are being introduced so that strikes only happen when a clear majority of those entitled to vote have done so and all other possibilities have been explored.</p> \n<p>“This will deliver a key commitment we made in our manifesto.”</p> \n<p>The employment minister, Nick Boles, said: “People have the right to expect that services on which they and their families rely are not going to be disrupted at short notice by strikes that have the support of only a small proportion of union members.</p> \n<p>“These are sensible and fair reforms that balance the right to strike with the right of millions of people to go about their daily lives without last minute disruption.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436904720792/e198125a-c37a-4bc0-a403-eced5d0c8619-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave Evans/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"PCS union members march in central London, October 2014.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave Evans/Demotix/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-15T07:38:33Z","lastModified":"2015-07-15T07:38:35Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2935,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Wintour","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/4/1423058528318/Patrick-Wintour-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrickwintour"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Trade unions","Conservatives","Sajid Javid","TUC","Politics","UK news","Employment law","Law","Public services policy","Society","Economics","Business"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/tradeunions","webTitle":"Trade unions"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/sajid-javid","webTitle":"Sajid Javid"},{"id":"politics/tuc","webTitle":"TUC"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"law/employment-law","webTitle":"Employment law"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"},{"id":"society/policy","webTitle":"Public services policy"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patrick Wintour","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patrickwintour"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/15/trade-unions-conservative-offensive-decades-strikes-labour","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak9g","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/jul/15/trade-unions-conservative-offensive-decades-strikes-labour","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/jul/15/trade-unions-conservative-offensive-decades-strikes-labour"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436904720792/e198125a-c37a-4bc0-a403-eced5d0c8619-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"PCS union members march in central London, October 2014.

education may be a poor investment, according to research commissioned by a firm of stockbrokers that shows rapid growth in independent school fees outstripping the incomes of middle class professionals. The research, published by investment advisers <a href=\"https://www.killik.com/\">Killik &amp; Co</a>, says the &pound;236,000 paid by parents of a day pupil would, if invested, return nearly &pound;800,000 over the child’s lifetime – enough to pay for university, put down a substantial deposit on a house and leave &pound;500,000 for retirement.</p> \n<p>“With such a large sum potentially at stake, it makes sense for parents to ask whether the amounts that they would have invested in their children’s education could not be better invested to set them up financially for life, while sending their children to a good state school,” the research states.

The average day fee is now more than &pound;13,000 a year – a 340% increase since 1990, or 150% after adjusting for inflation. <br /></p> \n<p>The proportion of a typical doctor’s disposable income accounted for by the costs of schooling is now 38%, compared with just 17% in 1990. A typical accountant would have 59% of his or her disposable income eaten by school fees, compared with 26% 25 years ago. Members of the clergy – who could once comfortably send their children to private schools – would have to give up about 80% of after-tax income to pay for independent fees today.

She spent a night on a sand bar, where she felt safer. She drank small amounts of the flowing water but worried she might get sick if she drank more.</p> \n<p>She followed the river to a trail, and the trail to a highway. Two men driving by stopped and picked her up Monday afternoon, bringing her — about two full days after the crash — to the safety of a general store in Mazama, a tiny town in north-central Washington, near the east entrance of North Cascades national park.</p> \n<p>“We crashed, and I was the only one that made it out,” she told a 911 operator, after a store employee called for her. “I have a lot of burns on my hands, and I’m kind of covered in bruises and scratches and stuff.”</p> \n<p>As authorities continued searching for the plane’s wreckage on Tuesday, aided by clues Veatch provided, they also marvelled at the wherewithal of a teenager who managed to survive — and to later joke from her hospital bed about how it was a good thing her dad made her watch the television show Survivor.</p> \n<p>“She’s got an amazing story, and I hope she gets to tell it soon,” said Okanogan County Sheriff Frank Rogers, who had interviewed Veatch and relayed details of her ordeal to the Associated Press. “It’s pretty impressive when you talk to her.”</p> \n<p>According to Rogers the Beechcraft A-35 was flying over north-central Washington on its way from Kalispell, Montana, to Lynden, Washington, when it entered a cloud bank. Then the clouds suddenly parted, and from her seat behind the cockpit Veatch could see the mountain and trees ahead. Her step-grandfather, Leland Bowman, of Marion, Montana, was piloting with his wife, Sharon, by his side. He tried to pull up — to no avail.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457487951__\n</div> \n<p>They struck the trees and the plane plummeted to the ground and caught fire.</p> \n<p>“When they came out of the clouds, she said it was obvious they were too low,” Rogers said. “They crashed right into the trees and hit the ground. She tried to do what she could to help her grandparents, but she couldn’t because of the fire.”</p> \n<p>Veatch had no life-threatening injuries but was dehydrated and suffering from a treatable muscle tissue breakdown caused by vigorous exercise without food or water, said Scott Graham, chief executive officer of Three Rivers hospital in Brewster.</p> \n<p>Anita Fisk, director of human resources at the hospital, said Veach was in stable condition on Tuesday. It was not immediately known when she might be released.</p> \n<p>“It’s a miracle, no question about it,” Lieutenant Colonel Jeffrey Lustick of the Civil Air Patrol told reporters, saying he had spent 30 years in search and rescue and “moments of joy like this can be hard to find.”</p> \n<p>Lustick said even with the clues Veatch provided, finding the wreckage and getting to it remained a daunting challenge — especially considering that the plane may have broken apart and now be hidden under the thick tree canopy.</p> \n<p>Veatch’s father, David Veatch, of Bellingham, told reporters outside the hospital late on Monday that his daughter was exhausted but doing remarkably well. She was able to joke with him about the survival shows they watched together on television, he said.</p> \n<p>“She’s just an amazing kid,” David Veatch said. “There’s more to her than she knows.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/HeatherGrafK5/statuses/620984921717239808\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">9 am update: Family tells us plane crash survivor Autumn Veath slept on and off through the night and is doing well. <a href=\"http://t.co/adwZQXDo5p\">pic.twitter.com/adwZQXDo5p</a></p>— Heather Graf (@HeatherGrafK5) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeatherGrafK5/status/620984921717239808\">July 14, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Autumn Veatch’s boyfriend, Newton Goss, said he and his mother had been supposed to pick her up from the airport on Saturday.

For anyone wanting take pictures or carry out a Q&amp;A on its beach, the city council has decreed that there is a &pound;200 fee.

The council’s press office passed the matter on to the city’s events office. An official there said it would charge &pound;200 for a licence allowing the interview to be recorded and Ware to be photographed next to the water. <br /></p> \n<p>The official said in an email: “This is a chargeable activity. We would charge &pound;200 for audio recording and photographs. If you wish to go ahead with this booking, please let me know and I will get you the consent form.”<br /></p> \n<p>When the Guardian expressed surprise that the council’s policy was to charge for newsgathering, the official replied: “News to us is ‘current affairs’, and we define current affairs as something that is spontaneous, such as filming for the weather programme. Your proposal is a planned article, and is therefore is a chargeable activity. I hope that this answers your question.”<br /></p> \n<p>The official added that the beach stretched to Rottingdean around four miles to the east of Brighton city centre, and Portslade, three miles west. When he was asked if there were any restrictions in other parts of Brighton – for example, the street – he said: “Anywhere in Brighton, including the highways, there would be a charge to you, except for private property. I can suggest contacting the pier, which is privately owned.”<br /></p> \n<p>Jodie Ginsberg, chief executive of <a href=\"https://www.indexoncensorship.org/\">Index on Censorship</a>, said: “Journalists should not be charged in order to carry out their jobs. This runs counter to all the principles that should underpin a free and independent media.”<br /></p> \n<p>Bob Satchwell, executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.societyofeditors.co.uk/\">Society of Editors</a>, branded the move outrageous. He said: “Beaches and streets are public places. If local councils are to start charging for reporting the news, it is time someone reminded them that we are supposed to live in a free society.”<br /></p> \n<p>Michael Bromley, interim head of journalism at City University London, said: “Well, it would be funny if it weren’t so pathetic. The irony, of course, is that the council is compelled to provide, at its own cost, press facilities for its own meetings. Maybe Brighton council should meet on the beach and charge an entry fee?”<br /></p> \n<p>It is understood that a charity was also told it would have to pay if it wished to take images on the beach.<br /></p> \n<p>The Guardian went ahead and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/22/shoot-em-ups-crashing-waves-human-league-martyn-ware-seaside-sound-brighton\">photographed Ware</a> on the pier and carried out the audio interview on the beach without paying the charge. Later, when the Guardian asked the council again about the policy, its press office said it stemmed from a decision made by the economic development and culture committee in June last year, at which point the council was run by the Green party.<br /></p> \n<p>The council approved <a href=\"http://present.brighton-hove.gov.uk/Published/C00000705/M00005164/AI00040101/$FilmingFeesCharges3.doc.pdf\">new fees and charges</a> payable for filming in the city. In 2013-14 the council was paid more than &pound;33,000 for 135 pieces of filming. It agreed to introduce a new structure from 2014-15 that would include an increase in charges and the introduction of a &pound;50 administration charge and hourly rates.</p> \n<p>Councillors agreed that makers of “documentaries/music videos/pieces to camera” would be charged at &pound;300 a day or &pound;100 an hour. Producers of “television drama/advert/feature film” would pay &pound;400 a day or &pound;100 an hour. But they also agreed that “news, weather, tourism” pieces should not be charged for after considering a report from a senior officer stating: “They are items of public information or directly promote the city as a destination.”<br /></p> \n<p>Geoffrey Bowden, who was a Green councillor and chair of the committee but lost his seat in the spring, said the charges had been aimed at organisations such as commercial film-makers and agencies making advertisements. “I was given a democratic boot up the rear by the electorate in May. However, I can only apologise that an officer has, in my opinion, misinterpreted the filming-fees regime in this way.”<br /></p> \n<p>Bowden, himself a journalist and PR man, said Brighton would open itself up to accusations of acting like a totalitarian regime such as North Korea if it did try to charge for genuine newsgathering.<br /></p> \n<p>Lucas was prepared to be more forgiving. “A council officer has clearly made a mistake on this occasion. The policy should never have been extended to newsgathering. It’s right that the council has apologised and I trust that similar incidents won’t occur in the future.”<br /></p> \n<p>The council said it was in discussion about how to make sure that such a situation did not arise again. It said it would investigate the circumstances of a charity being charged. It has stressed that it certainly did not charge visitors to take pictures on its beaches or public places.<br /></p> \n<p>A council spokesperson said: “Fees for filming and commercial photo shoots were agreed in the economic and culture committee in June 2014, in common with many other local authorities. </p> \n<p>“Fees are not charged for current affairs, weather reports or press photography in the city.

The event culminated an initiative to survey the solar system that the space agency embarked upon more than 50 years ago. </p> \n <p>About 13 hours after its closest approach to Pluto, the last major unexplored body in the solar system, New Horizons phoned home, signaling that it had survived its 31,000 miles per hour (49,000 km/hour) blitz through the Pluto system. </p> \n <p>Managers had estimated there was a one-in-10,000 chance a debris strike could destroy New Horizons as it soared just 7,750 miles (12,472 km) –about the distance from New York to Mumbai – from Pluto. </p> \n <p>But right on time, New Horizons made radio contact with flight controllers at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab outside Baltimore, sparking a wave of shouts and applause from an overflow crowd gathered to watch the drama unfold. </p> \n <p>With 99% of the data gathered during the encounter still on the spaceship, New Horizons’ survival was critical to the mission. </p> \n <p>“This is truly a hallmark in human history,” said <strong>John Grunsfeld</strong>, Nasa’s associate administrator for science. </p> \n <p>Scientists have many questions about Pluto, which was still considered the solar system’s ninth planet when New Horizons was launched in 2006.</p> \n <p>Pluto was reclassified as a “dwarf planet” after the discovery of other Pluto-like spheres orbiting in the Kuiper Belt, the region beyond the eighth planet, Neptune.

It now believes the debt ratio will still be 170% in 2022 after hitting a peak of 200%. </p> \n<p>The IMF has consistently urged deeper debt relief throughout the Greek crisis, but has met resistance from European finance ministers, who have been unwilling to make their taxpayers pay the cost of a write down. Tsipras has also insisted that debt relief must form an important part of the package, but a statement by Eurozone leaders on Monday said only that further measures might be taken provided Greece adhered in full to the reforms demanded by its creditors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/13/alexis-tsipras-eurozone-bailout-plan-greek-parliament\">Alexis Tsipras aims to steer eurozone bailout plan through Greek parliament</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In the leaked report, the IMF says that Greece’s debts threaten to be unsustainable for decades, and that its financing needs will rise so that they are above the 15% of national income level deemed safe. The IMF adds that unless European creditors agree to an extended grace period, they face the choice of either annual transfers to the Greek budget, or “deep upfront haircuts”, the term for the cancellation of part of the debt. IMF sources confirmed that an updated debt sustainability analysis had been prepared by staff and would be discussed by the organisation’s executive board.</p> \n<p>Unless the IMF can convince itself that Greece’s debts are sustainable, it would be forbidden by its own rules to put money into a new bailout. The assumption has been that the fund would provide €16.4bn – around 25% of the total – with the rest coming from the ESM.</p> \n<p>The European commission, one of Greece’s three creditors alongside the IMF and the European Central Bank, sought to play down the report. A commission spokeswoman said that the IMF and the commission had together signed off on a different debt sustainability document. This was the paper sent to eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and formed the basis for the bailout agreement signed off by eurozone leaders on Monday morning, she said. </p> \n<p>Reports of renewed IMF concerns came as Tsipras tried to convince dissident MPs in his own Syriza party to back another round of austerity. Ahead of the make-or-break vote in Athens’s parliament, Tsipras held back-to-back meetings as he attempted to rally support for measures at total variance with the rationale of his radical left party. Creditors have given the Greek government until Wednesday to push controversial reforms, including sales tax increases and pension reforms, through parliament. </p> \n<p>Appalled by Tsipras’s volte-face, an estimated 35 Syriza MPs signalled on Tuesday night that they would vote against the measures, arguing that the “recessionary policies” will only worsen the record levels of poverty and unemployment Greece has already suffered. Panagiotis Lafazanis, the energy minister who heads Syriza’s Left Platform, implored the prime minister to turn down the terms. He called the proposals the work of “economic murderers” intent on destroying Greece.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/14/history-shows-how-the-greek-crisis-could-pan-out\">History shows how the Greek crisis could pan out | Letters</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even if it was endorsed by the 300-seat House with the help of opposition parties – as seems likely – “it will never be passed by the people who effectively will eradicate it with their unity and struggles,” Lafazanis said. </p> \n<p>With Tsipras’ own position looking increasingly vulnerable, the country appears headed for fresh political tumult. On Tuesday night government insiders insisted the prime minister had no intention of standing down, saying he would probably attempt to clear the political terrain with a cabinet reshuffle on Thursday. <br /></p> \n<p>Tsipras told public television last night: “The worst thing a captain could do while he is steering a ship during a storm, as difficult as it is, would be to abandon the helm.” <br /></p> \n<p>But if losses are heavy, and he loses his parliamentary majority, the young leader might also be forced to from a cross-party government of national unity. </p> \n<p>“Political developments inside Syriza will be rapid and dramatic,” said professor Dimitris Keridis who teaches political science at Athens’ Panteion University.</p> \n<p> “But we will see a realignment in Greek parliamentary politics in support of the deal which, hopefully, will be cathartic and provide stability,” he said. “Tsipras is being asked to pay for the sins of a previous political class. The great irony is a radical leftist will now have to impose all the reforms that were never passed before, neo-liberal measures that he has always opposed.”</p> \n<p>The neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party quickly sought to capitalise on the popular anger that the deal is bound to unleash. “Golden Dawn will resist the new memorandum that the government of the left will sign with the complete support of New Democracy, To Potami and Pasok,” said the organisation’s leader Nikos Michaloliakos, referring to the opposition parties. “An avalanche of taxes is coming. New annihilating measures that will mainly affect the country’s youth, that will increase unemployment and hit farmers who are the soul of the nation, are coming. From every place in this land the battle will continue … so that the plans of foreign rule are not passed.” </p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436917052456/08b35d5b-dce4-4df8-b215-5c159a172e27-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Emilio Morenatti/AP","altText":"Butchers wait for clients in a meat market in central Athens.
