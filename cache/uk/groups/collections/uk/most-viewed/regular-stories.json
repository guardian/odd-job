In a separate statement issued later, Scott echoed the governor’s call.</p> \n<p>“I do not believe the vast majority of folks who support the flag have hate in their hearts,” Scott said. “Their heritage is a part of our state’s history, and we should not ignore that. However, for so many others in our state, the flag represents pain and oppression.</p> \n<p>“Because of that, as a life-long South Carolinian, as someone who loves this state and will never call anywhere else home, I believe it is time for the flag to come down.”</p> \n<p>Haley said the state legislature intended to address the flag issue in an extraordinary session, originally scheduled to finish budget work, to begin on Tuesday. If the legislature fails to take up the issue, Haley said, she would call the legislature into an emergency session over the summer – a painstaking prospect for members.</p> \n<p>Under a 2000 law that moved the flag on capitol grounds from atop the statehouse dome to a Confederate war memorial about 200 feet away, the flag may not again be moved without a two-thirds majority assent of the general assembly. However, state legislators said a court challenge of the 2000 law could vacate the requirement for a supermajority.</p> \n<p>Five days after the shooting at Charleston’s historic Emanuel AME church, the city’s mayor, Joe Riley, said the presence of the Confederate battle flag in front of the statehouse “sends mixed messages” and that the symbol of a failed attempt at secession by the pro-slavery southern states should be relegated to “its appropriate historical context”.</p> \n<p>Pressure on South Carolina leaders to pull down the flag had mounted, as politicians and activists said it continued to inflame racial tensions in the wake of Wednesday’s shooting. The suspect in the shooting, Dylann Roof, was linked to online manifestos expounding racism accompanied by pictures of him holding the flag. </p> \n<p>Hundreds of demonstrators gathered at South Carolina’s state house in Columbia on Saturday night to support lawmakers’ demands that the Confederate flag be barred from flying on its grounds in the aftermath of the church massacre.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/21/rally-calls-for-confederate-flags-removal-from-south-carolina-legislature-grounds\">Rally calls for Confederate flag's removal from South Carolina legislature grounds</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lindsey Graham, the state’s senior senator and a Republican candidate for president, joined the call for the flag to come down, as a cavalcade of statements from leaders of the party followed the governor’s announcement. </p> \n<p>“Today, I am urging that the Confederate battle flag be removed from statehouse grounds to an appropriate location,” he said in a statement. “I hope, by removing the flag, we can take another step towards healing and recognition – and a sign that South Carolina is moving forward.”</p> \n<p>Graham’s evolution on the issue of what to do with the flag was followed by fellow contenders for the Republican nomination including Scott Walker, who as recently as Sunday <a href=\"http://crooksandliars.com/2015/06/walker-boldly-punts-charleston-confederate\">said that it would be inappropriate</a> to debate the issue until the victims had been buried.</p> \n<p>“I am glad [Haley] is calling for the Confederate flag to come down,” Walker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScottWalker/status/613080253930409985\">tweeted</a> on Monday. “I support her decision.”</p> \n<p>The governor had previously said her hands were tied on the flag’s removal, as the state legislature would need to vote to remove the flag by a two-thirds majority.</p> \n<p>“I think the state will start talking about that again and we’ll see where it goes,” <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/south-carolinas-confederate-flag-not-lowered-half-mast-after-church-n378316\">Haley said</a> on Friday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/22/charleston-killings-confederate-flag-debate\">Is the Confederate flag a racist symbol?

In 2000, legislators reached an agreement to move the flag to a Confederate memorial inside capitol grounds.</p> \n<p>State representative Doug Brannon, an author of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WLTX/status/613079490420453376\">legislation to be introduced on Tuesday</a> to have the flag removed entirely from the capitol, said the bill had ample support among colleagues he had spoken with in the House, but that he had not spoken to any senators.</p> \n<p>“The flag of their heritage is fine for them. And their flag of heritage needs to be in a museum,” Brannon said. “The flag that I’m talking about was put up by a bunch of white guys in 1962 in response to desegregation. And that’s not heritage. That’s hate.”</p> \n<p>“It eventually will come down,” said state senator Kevin L Bryant, a Republican. “Some say it’s offensive and it needs to come down. Some are saying his great-great-grandfather fought and died in [the civil war], and he wants it to stay up in his honor.

Athens is merely the worst outbreak of a much bigger disease within the euro project. Because the single currency isn’t working for ordinary Europeans, from the Ruhr valley to Rome.</p> \n<p>On saying this, I don’t close my eyes to the endemic corruption and tax-dodging in Greece (nor indeed, does the outsiders’ movement Syriza, which came to power campaigning against just these vices). Nor am I about to don Farage-ist chalkstripes. My charge is much simpler: the euro project is not only failing to deliver on the promises of its originators, it’s doing the exact opposite – by eroding the living standards of ordinary Europeans. And as we’ll see, that’s true even for those living in the continent’s number one economy, Germany.</p> \n<p>First, let’s remind ourselves of the noble pledges made for the euro project. Let’s play the grainy footage of Germany’s Helmut Schmidt and France’s Giscard d’Estaing, as they lay the foundations for Europe’s grand unifier. Most of all, let’s remind ourselves of what the true believers felt. Take this from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/jul/16/germany-left-doubt-single-currency\" title=\"\">Oskar Lafontaine</a>, Germany’s minister of finance, on the very eve of the launch of the euro. He talked of “the vision of a united Europe, to be reached through the gradual convergence of living standards, the deepening of democracy, and the flowering of a truly European culture”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This isn’t about creating a deeper democracy, but deeper markets – and the two are increasingly incompatible</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We could quote a thousand other such stanzas of euro-poetry, but that single line from Lafontaine shows how far the single-currency project has fallen. Instead of raising living standards across Europe, monetary union is pushing them downwards. Rather than deepening democracy, it is undermining it. As for “a truly European culture”, when German journalists accuse Greek ministers of “psychosis”, that mythic agora of nations is a long way off.</p> \n<p>Of all these three charges, the first is most important – because it explains how the entire union is being undermined. To see what’s happened to the living standards of ordinary Europeans, turn to some extraordinary research published this year by Heiner Flassbeck, former chief economist at the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, and Costas Lapavitsas, an economics professor at Soas University of London turned Syriza MP.</p> \n<p>In Against the Troika, the German and the Greek publish one chart that explodes the idea that the euro has raised living standards. What they look at is unit labour costs – how much you need to pay staff to make one unit of output: a widget, say, or a bit of software. And they map labour costs across the eurozone from 1999 to 2013. What they find is that German workers have barely seen wages rise for the 14-year stretch. In the short life of the euro, working Germans have fared worse than the French, Austrians, Italians and many across southern Europe.</p> \n<p>Yes, we’re talking about the same Germany: the mightiest economy on the continent, the one even David Cameron regards with envy. Yet the people working there and making the country more prosperous have seen barely any reward for their efforts. And this is the model for a continent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/21/tsipras-of-athens-drama-entering-gripping-final-act\">Tsipras of Athens – a gripping drama entering its final act | Larry Elliott</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Perhaps you have an image of Deutschland as being a nation of highly skilled, highly rewarded workers in gleaming factories. That workforce and its unions still exist – but it’s shrinking fast. What’s replacing it, according to Germany’s leading expert on inequality, Gerhard Bosch, are crap jobs. The low-wage workforce has shot up and is now almost at US levels, he reckons.</p> \n<p>Don’t blame this on the euro, but on the slow decline of German unions, and the trend of business towards outsourcing to cheaper eastern Europe. What the single currency has done is make Germany’s low-wage problems the ruin of an entire continent.</p> \n<p>Workers in France, Italy, Spain and the rest of the eurozone are now being undercut by the epic wage freeze going on in the giant country in the middle. Flassbeck and Lapavitsas describe this as Germany’s “beggar thy neighbour” policy – “but only after beggaring its own people”.</p> \n<p>In the last century, the other countries in the eurozone could have become more competitive by devaluing their national currencies – just as the UK has done since the banking meltdown. But now they’re all part of the same club, the only post-crash solution has been to pay workers less.</p> \n<p>That is expressly what the European commission, the European Central Bank and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/18/greece-faces-banking-crisis-after-eurozone-meeting-breaks-down\" title=\"\">IMF</a> are telling Greece: make workers redundant, pay those still in a job much less, and slash pensions for the elderly. But it’s not just in Greece. Nearly every meeting of the Wise Folk in Brussels and Strasbourg comes up with the same communique for “reform” of the labour market and social-security entitlements across the continent: a not-so-coded call for attacking ordinary people’s living standards.</p> \n<p>This is what the noble European project is turning into: a grim march to the bottom. This isn’t about creating a deeper democracy, but deeper markets – and the two are increasingly incompatible. Germany’s Angela Merkel has shown no compunction about meddling in the democratic affairs of other European countries – tacitly warning Greeks against voting for Syriza for instance, or forcing the Spanish socialist prime minister, Jos&eacute; Luis Rodr&iacute;guez Zapatero, to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2011/mar/28/residents-trapped-spanish-ghost-towns\" title=\"\">rip up the spending commitments that had won him an election</a>.</p> \n<p>The diplomatic beatings administered to Syriza since it came to power this year can only be seen as Europe trying to set an example to any Spanish voters who might be tempted to support its sister movement Podemos. Go too far left, runs the message, and you’ll get the same treatment.</p> \n<p>Whatever the founding ideals of the eurozone, they don’t match up to the grim reality in 2015. This is Thatcher’s revolution, or Reagan’s – but now on a continental scale. And as then, it is accompanied by the idea that There Is No Alternative either to running an economy, or even to which kind of government voters get to choose.</p> \n<p>The fact that this entire show is being brought in by agreeable-looking Wise Folk often claiming to be social democratic doesn’t render the project any nicer or gentler. It just lends the entire thing a nasty tang of hypocrisy.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434997490409/Matt-Kenyon-illustration-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'This is what the noble European project is turning into: a grim march to the bottom.

GPs will also be able to order more tests than at present, which should speed up a diagnosis.<br /></p> \n<p>“It’s about getting the right patients to the right tests at the right time,” said Willie Hamilton, professor of primary-care diagnostics at Exeter University, who helped develop the guidance. “One of the difficulties in our field is identifying the patient who has cancer over all the other patients who don’t.” <br /></p> \n<p>GPs are already able to request X-rays, blood tests and some scans, but now they will be able to get fast-tracked endoscopy investigations and MRI or CT brain scans tests that a specialist might order after referral of a patient but which will now bring a faster result.<br /></p> \n<p>There are 300,000 cancer diagnoses each year in the UK and 40,000 doctors, which means the average GP will see about eight. Under the new guidance, doctors and patients who suspect cancer will be able to look up the symptoms and find out which tests are appropriate. <br /></p> \n<p>Fatigue, for instance, might mean ovarian or lung cancer, mesothelioma or leukaemia, but unexplained fatigue in somebody over 40 who has never smoked merits a chest X-ray for lung cancer. Unexplained fatigue in women would justify a blood test for ovarian cancer.<br /></p> \n<p>Abdominal pain could be a sign of one of five cancers. In the upper abdomen, with weight loss in the over-55s, it could be caused by oesophageal or stomach cancer, but occurring elsewhere in the abdomen, in a patient aged 60, an urgent CT scan might reveal pancreatic cancer.<br /></p> \n<p>Not every patient going to a GP will be assessed for cancer symptoms, but “there is an educational element to his guidance”, said Hamilton. “For some patients with abdominal pain, cancer is not the first thing you think of.” But, he added, “if your first idea of what you think is wrong with the patient turns out to be wrong, cancer will be higher up the agenda.”<br /></p> \n<p>The guidance is also “to inform the public where risks are and where risks aren’t”, said Dr Steve Hajioff, a director of public health and chair of the Nice guidance group. Some information patients can find online is useful and some is harmful, he said. “My personal view is that it is never wrong to share with people the information that allows them to make decisions about their own health.”<br /></p> \n<p>While more people may ask GPs whether they have cancer, others may read the guidance and decide they are not at risk. “Even if it were to increase, I would suggest that it is an appropriate increase,” said Hajioff. The savings from treating people early – in terms of lives as well as financial costs – would justify any increase in GP appointments and tests.<br /></p> \n<p>Dr Rosie Loftus, joint chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: “We know that every GP wants to do a good job and identify cancer early, and what will really enable them to do so consistently is more practical support in the workplace. In particular, they need more support to identify the symptoms of cancer types which are very hard to spot.”</p> \n<p>Sara Hiom, director of early diagnosis for Cancer Research UK, said more diagnostic resources must be made available. “We know a lot more about symptoms and symptom clusters. For those patients who in the past have perhaps been let down by the system, we must remember a number of things, such as a diagnosis of cancer is a complex thing and cancer, while a common disease, is very rare in primary care. </p> \n<p>“It certainly seems to be the case, and research would indicate, we do fewer diagnostic tests in this country than comparable countries, but there is a lack of workforce, perhaps a lack of kit, to do those tests, so patients may be missing out because there are delays, backlogs or bottlenecks and this really does need to be addressed.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435003710717/38a0dcf8-a984-475b-bb69-17acf48489ad-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kallista Images/Visuals Unlimited","altText":"An X-ray showing cancer in a smoker’s lung.
