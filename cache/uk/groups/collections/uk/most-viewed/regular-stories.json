In a defining moment of the last anti-Heathrow campaign, Greenpeace, backed by political leaders and celebrities, <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/climate/airplot/about-airplot\">announced</a>: “We’ve bought a piece of land slap bang in the middle of the proposed third runway site.”</p> \n<p>Emma Thompson owned a bit. Alistair McGowan owned a bit. So did Zac Goldsmith, and during 2009 almost 100,000 Britons were persuaded to sign up as beneficial co-owners of the AirPlot to defy the planners. The words “Our climate, our land” were spelt out on the plot in great white letters, and <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/node/10645\">then the planting began</a>. David Cameron had a tree planted for him, Nick Clegg planted his own and the runway plans were shelved. </p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457275342__\n</div> \n<p>A little over two years later, in January 2012, Greenpeace, McGowan, Thompson and Goldsmith sold the land back for a pound, and the trees died.</p> \n<p>The world believed Greenpeace had bought the Airplot in perpetuity, but in fact the charity had quietly agreed to return it to a local landlord. The deal to acquire it for &pound;15,000 included an option for him to buy it back for &pound;1. The landlord effectively offered to renew a lease, but Greenpeace decided to let the land go.</p> \n<p>In the village of Sipson, anyone looking for the apple tree adopted by the prime minister will search in vain. Instead there are thistles and five-foot high grass. The plot was hopefully marketed as a paddock when it went on sale again, just as Heathrow was drawing up new plans for a third runway and bending enough ears for Downing Street to appoint a commission to decide whether the airport should have a new runway after all. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3c5f9afa22281c8858c5ddf9f126cff9dffd837a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3c5f9afa22281c8858c5ddf9f126cff9dffd837a/0_0_2456_921/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heathrow headline\" width=\"1000\" height=\"375\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">How the Guardian reported the story in January 2009.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By 2013, when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2013/jul/17/heathrow-third-runway-expansion-proposals\">Heathrow resubmitted a plan</a> to bulldoze Sipson, far from being unable to build on the AirPlot the airport could have simply snapped it up, along with a neighbouring three-bed semi and shed. </p> \n<p>It came as a surprise to locals and campaigners to find that the land was no longer in the hands of the environmentalists and their celebrity patrons. Christine Taylor, of Stop Heathrow Expansion, whose family have lived in and around Sipson for decades, said: “No one was more shocked and upset than I was to find out we didn’t in fact own it.

The three options Heathrow offered have been narrowed to one new expansion plan that ends yards to the west of the AirPlot, and which would render life unbearable in Sipson, at the very tip of a runway.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e7e7308af8040ce1681df0c55dc977ba85b36184\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e7e7308af8040ce1681df0c55dc977ba85b36184/0_127_4080_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alison Steadman and Richard Briers from the Good Life eat apples at a photocall for the orchard\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alison Steadman and Richard Briers from the Good Life eat apples at a photocall for the orchard.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vicki Couchman/Greenpeace</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The fate of the wooden plaques marking the trees – the Cox’s Pippin adopted by Cameron’s Conservatives, and the Langley Pippin planted by the actors Alison Steadman and Richard Briers with the poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy – is unknown. The landlord, Michael Aslam, said: “They were just thrown away.” And the trees? “They died. Soon after the demonstration the grass was taller than the trees and they rotted, and that was it.”</p> \n<p>According to Greenpeace, the trees were alive when it sold the land back to Aslam in January 2012. </p> \n<p>The celebrities who technically owned the land have declined to comment. One of the prominent beneficial owners Greenpeace enlisted at the start of its campaign, the environmentalist and Guardian columnist George Monbiot, said he was unaware of the ownership status of the land. </p> \n<p>Neither did Greenpeace inform the tens of thousands of supporters who joined up as beneficial co-owners that the property was no longer theirs. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31f9d8f50cb841cf7c41309614628a8c0d487b78\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/31f9d8f50cb841cf7c41309614628a8c0d487b78/186_53_2298_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The supposed orchard as it is today\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The supposed orchard as it is today.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gwyn Topham for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ian West, a campaigner living at Grow Heathrow, a sustainable protest camp that continues independently near the AirPlot, said people still visited Sipson thinking they owned a piece of the land. “It did bring a lot of publicity, but the fact that Greenpeace didn’t have a long-term plan does highlight the different approaches,” he said. </p> \n<p>Even if the Davies commission opts for Gatwick, there needs to be a long-term plan to help the blighted area and community survive, West said. </p> \n<p>Taylor said she didn’t blame Greenpeace, “though I wish they’d been upfront with us. We could have looked at something with longevity because we knew Heathrow would keep coming back. We do need a piece of land that would be forever.”</p> \n<p>Anna Jones, of Greenpeace, said the charity and the three legal owners decided in 2012 against holding on to the land, declining an option to retain it until 2014 for an extra &pound;10,000. “We judged it wasn’t a wise use of supporters’ money. It was a judgment call at that time. We still think it’s very unlikely that the runway will get built.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"842c681f12c6d0cf622c969fa81db209dfaafa09\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/842c681f12c6d0cf622c969fa81db209dfaafa09/459_327_3389_2034/1000.jpg\" alt=\"No third runway signs in the village of Sipson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘No third runway’ signs in the village of Sipson.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“By everybody pitching in we completely turned the tables … Everybody should be proud and we have an incredible legacy.”</p> \n<p>Greenpeace helped win a great battle in 2010 when the coalition overturned plans for a third runway, but while the continued opposition by Greenpeace and likes of Goldsmith is not in doubt, others fear that the prime minister’s pledge to block Heathrow expansion is as perishable as his pippin. </p> \n<p>For Sipson and its residents, the fight goes on.

It predicted chaos in the health service, and urged the Home Office to add nursing to the list of occupations exempt from the rules and reconsider the salary threshold.</p> \n<p>But nurses won’t be the only people affected by the changes. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/migration\">Migration</a> figures published in May reveal migration for work from outside Europe rose by 24,000 to 68,000 in 2014, with nearly all coming on skilled work visas. &pound;35,000 is a salary that won’t affect those working in finance or, for the most part, IT, but there are many other sectors with workers who will be forced to leave <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/420536/20150406_immigration_rules_appendix_i_final.pdf\">when the pay threshold comes into force.</a><br /></p> \n<p>For decades, settlement has been granted on the basis of length of time living in the UK, as well as pre-existing ties to the country.

In fact, at 57, she looks fantastic: Cheshire-cat grin sweet as ever, genuinely pleased with the commemorative cake the brand has baked for her. It’s teatime halfway through the Cannes film festival and MacDowell is sitting in a suite at the H&ocirc;tel Martinez, one of the most decadent pit stops on the Croisette. This passes for familiar territory: <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/stevensoderbergh\" title=\"\">Steven Soderbergh</a>’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/apr/17/my-favourite-cannes-winner-sex-lies-and-videotape\" title=\"\">Sex, Lies and Videotape</a>, her breakthrough, won the Palme d’Or here in 1989; I assume that was her first Cannes. “I didn’t come,” she says forlornly. “I had just had a baby, and I was afraid people would make fun of me. Because I looked … big. Now people can make fun of me and I don’t mind so much. I was more sensitive back then.”</p> \n<p>Insecurity turns out to be a bit of a leitmotif for MacDowell, alongside the steeliness that carried her through her early struggles as a star. This yin and yang is key to her screen appeal, certainly in her most effective performances: the sexually repressed wife who finds liberation in Sex, Lies and Videotape, the grieving mother who finally snaps in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,544570,00.html\" title=\"\">Short Cuts</a>, the kindly news producer who repeatedly slaps <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/bill-murray\" title=\"\">Bill Murray</a>’s weatherman in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79383/groundhog-day\" title=\"\">Groundhog Day</a>. It has been some time since she starred in a film as impactful as any of those, so it’s easy to forget just how huge she was: during the 1990s she’d already been nominated for three Golden Globes before the release of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/four-weddings-and-a-funeral\" title=\"\">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/may/07/magic-mike-xxl-trailer-review-no-doom-no-gloom-just-nipples\">Magic Mike XXL trailer review: no doom, no gloom, just nipples</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And now she’s set to return to multiplexes in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/magic-mike\" title=\"\">Magic Mike XXL</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/channing-tatum\" title=\"\">Channing Tatum</a>’s second ode to male stripping. Much lighter than its predecessor, the film is low on plot, high on road-trip, as Tatum and his abdominal all-stars amble down south for an enormous strip-show; the film is basically one big hen do. Stopping off to meet a friend, they instead find her mother, played by MacDowell as an outrageously flirty, sexually charged, loose-lipped woman who’ll be damned if she’s gonna let her daughter have all the fun. Of the part, MacDowell says she “really wanted it very bad”. Why? “Because the character is completely different than anything I’ve played. She’s really wild, and foul-mouthed.” I ask for an example, because I want Andie MacDowell to swear at me. “Well, I say: ‘Watch your fuckin’ language.’ Which I think is a great line. Hahahaha! Watch your fuckin’ language.” Twice. Mission accomplished.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e64c8e9a5c2a1d1dce4511e921248d302ba01d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435242303529/cf10e1c4-baf5-48e7-b603-1ff4cb50d543-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MacDowell in Magic Mike XXL.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MacDowell in Magic Mike XXL.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>How does she feel about the cougar tag? “Hmm hmm,” she says, but her eyes don’t smile along with her mouth. Does she see her character like that? “I guess so, I think it’s unfair that we don’t have a male equivalent. There was a cougar line; I took it out. I didn’t wanna say it.” So she has a problem with the word? “I have a problem with the word.” Did she bristle when I said it? “Yeah. I just think it’s unnecessary. It’s demeaning. I think the idea that men get more handsome and sexier as they get older is a fallacy. There’s no difference. We’re the same. It was a way to empower men and disempower women. And that’s changing, because if I wanna date someone that’s 20 years younger than me, I can do that now.”</p> \n<p>What really appealed, she says, was how the women in the film – some of them plus-size – get to objectify the men. Such scenes, she says, she found “<em>quite</em> erotic. Oh gosh, they’re just really sexy women”. She almost blushes as she speaks; there’s an innocence about her. What did she think of the first Magic Mike? “It is, I will say, a little odd to go to the movies and get turned on with a bunch of other people. In the room! I was like, oh my <em>gosh</em>, this is an interesting feeling, you know, because it’s <em>really</em> sexy!”</p> \n<p>It took a long time for MacDowell to get what she wanted. Raised in Gaffney, a small town in South Carolina, her ambition was to act, but she didn’t have the courage to pursue it. “And once I started to model, I heard all the negative stuff that people would say. So I was afraid to try. I just didn’t want everybody to make fun of me.” In 1979 she went to New York, walked into the model agency Elite and was signed on the spot. A great time to be in Manhattan – Studio 54, she says, “was crazy. Crazy people dressed up, a lot of transgender looks – imagine that, in 1979. People doing drugs.” Was she attracted to the lifestyle? “No. I burned out on that really fast, because I started working all the time.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14f179f4e28407f5403e3f47ca9added47faec37\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435242371319/992ec448-9c2a-4194-a382-add870a87603-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MacDowell in Sex, Lies and Videotape.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MacDowell in Sex, Lies and Videotape.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In 1984, at 23, her modelling work brought her to the attention of the producers of Greystoke: the Legend of Tarzan, and she was cast as Jane opposite <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2010/jun/17/christophe-lambert-white-material-highlander\" title=\"\">Christopher Lambert</a>. But her triumph was short-lived: after filming, she learned that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/glenn-close\" title=\"\">Glenn Close</a> was to dub her throughout. “I could have definitely used some more training,” she says, but she was crushed; her fears had been validated. They wanted the face, but not the whole package. “I had three choices. The first was jump out a window. I thought about it.” Seriously? “For about three seconds. But it was an option. And I thought: ‘That’s stupid.’ Option No 2 was give up. Truly give up. ‘You’re no good. You’re a disaster. You’re horrible.’ And option three was fight. ‘Go prove yourself.’ And I chose option three.”</p> \n<p>Soon after, she was cast as the object of Emilio Estevez’s affection in Joel Schumacher’s 1985 bratpack melodrama St Elmo’s Fire. “I was shocked. Because I really was the untouchable.” Really? Or was that just how she felt? “I think I was. Everybody’s perception of me was that I was bad. It didn’t matter what I would do.” Possibly. Her on-screen sweetness in St Elmo’s didn’t lead to much. “I don’t think my performance was outstanding,” she says. “I think I was beautiful. I was very soft, I was very shy, so that didn’t change anybody’s mind.”</p> \n<p>She threw herself into acting classes, and signed with L’Or&eacute;al. But the years went on, and she was at her wits’ end just as Sex, Lies and Videotape turned up. Soderbergh had written the role of Ann, who discovers her husband is cheating on her, for Elizabeth McGovern, but her agent hated the script and never told her about it. Soderbergh didn’t want to see her (“Andie was forced upon me,” he says on the DVD commentary), but MacDowell was confident she’d get Ann right.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/feb/04/magic-mike-xxl-trailer-super-size-my-channing-hold-the-mcconaughey\">Magic Mike XXL trailer – super-size my Channing, hold the McConaughey</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“She was from the south. That’s not hard for me. And I knew a lot of women like her. Women who were frigid. There was this thing in the south, it used to be that the purity of a woman was so important. And my character was the A-student, wanted to get everything right. She was pure. She equated sex with not being pure.” She improvised in her audition, surprising Soderbergh; he cast her, later saying she’d blown his mind. To this day she says it’s the best role she’s ever been given, and it stands up as a frustrated, pent-up performance. “This poor woman hadn’t had an orgasm, what do you expect?” she laughs. The film changed her life: “I got out of the hole. I climbed my way out.”</p> \n<p>Sex, Lies and Videotape won her her first Golden Globe nomination; suddenly, credible film-makers wanted to work with her: <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/peter-weir\" title=\"\">Peter Weir</a> (Green Card), <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/robertaltman\" title=\"\">Robert Altman</a> (Short Cuts and The Player), <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/harold-ramis\" title=\"\">Harold Ramis</a> (Groundhog Day and Multiplicity). She beat Jennifer Jason Leigh, Julianne Moore and Laura Dern for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2010/sep/19/film-changed-life-grande-illusion\" title=\"\">Mike Newell</a>’s Four Weddings and a Funeral. The film’s budget was only &pound;2.8m, and she accepted a low fee as she thought “the script was perfect. It was flawless. Gorgeous.” In lieu of upfront cash, she took percentage points, which proved smart when it made &pound;159m. In Cannes for the film, surrounded by bodyguards, fans rocked her car on the way to the red carpet. This was 1994 – she was 36, and hit peak fame. “But it passes,” she says. In the late 90s she worked for Nora Ephron, Wim Wenders and Albert Brooks, but the 21st century resigned her to less impressive TV movies.</p> \n<p>She’s said in the past that professional rejection led her to therapy, which she now lives for. “I love the study of ego,” she says. “It’s a very cathartic way to live your life. Because we are victimised by what the world throws at us. Life can be hard … And projection. People project all kinds of cuckoo things on to actors.” Recently, she’s taken to addressing herself out loud, a technique she read about in a psychology magazine. It’s soothing, she says. “I use my name, Rose [her birth name is Rosalie Anderson MacDowell]. If I’m starting to panic, I go: ‘Uh uh, Rose: you’ve got this.’ It calms you down.”</p> \n<p>Magic Mike XXL reunites her with Soderbergh, who directed the original and took cinematography and editing duties on this one. “My heart was wide open, just to see him again,” she says. Their reunion made her feel reflective. Looking back on her career now, she says she regrets turning down certain roles because she was afraid of disappointing her family and queering her reputation back home. “I think the reason I understood [Sex, Lies and Videotape’s] Ann Bishop Mullany so well is I grew up in a culture where to be sexual was dirty. And I was also afraid of embarrassing my children. I was so afraid what people would say about me in my community. This was my way of thinking because I grew up around that kind of pressure, of purity. That was so much my childhood that I was afraid to be too provocative. Finally now, I realise. It’s kind of late in the day to be really provocative, but now I would do it. I’m sad that I didn’t take more chances.” What did she turn down? “There were some sexual roles I could have definitely fought for, at least.” Adrian Lyne’s kinkfest 9&frac12; Weeks was one, she says. “Now, in hindsight, if I could just tell my younger self to go in and fight for it. I didn’t even go in!”</p> \n<p>Is her Magic Mike role an attempt to redress that balance? The start of phase two? She laughs. “Some crazy sexy roles since I’m no longer worried about what people think? Hahahaha! Maybe! It’s a little late in life, but hey, why not!”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><em> Magic Mike XXL is released in the US on 1 July, the UK on 3 July and in Australia on 9 July.</em></p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435242266795/4dac88e7-4ec5-420c-a5d3-6e4b2e6fe9ba-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Danny Martindale/FilmMagic","altText":"Andie MacDowell in Cannes.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Danny Martindale/FilmMagic"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435242305060/cf10e1c4-baf5-48e7-b603-1ff4cb50d543-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"MacDowell in Magic Mike XXL.

One EU diplomat described the prime minister’s intervention as “a commercial break”. The diplomat said: “There was a very emotional discussion on migration, and David Cameron gave us a commercial break.”</p> \n<p>The prime minister’s intervention lasted between eight and 10 minutes, and there were no responses from any of the other 27 EU heads of government. The president of the European council, Donald Tusk – who was chairing the summit – was the only person in the room who responded to Cameron.</p> \n<p>The prime minister, who spoke to or briefed every EU leader in person before the summit, told his fellow EU leaders there has been widespread unease for many years in the UK over EU membership, and that he is determined to address the issue.</p> \n<p>Cameron insisted that he must achieve his reforms ahead of an in/out referendum, which will have to be held by the end of 2017. The reforms break down into four core areas:<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Banning EU migrants from claiming in-work benefits for four years.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> A British opt-out from the EU’s historic commitment, dating back to the founding treaty of Rome in 1957, to create an “ever closer union” of the peoples of Europe.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> The creation of safeguards for non-eurozone members to ensure they cannot be outvoted in the single market by eurozone members.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Giving national parliaments the right to club together to block EU legislation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It sounds like a post-dated cheque. It doesn’t work on any way you look at it</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Nigel Farage</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But the prime minister’s intervention, which will trigger the start of technical talks involving UK officials and officials in Brussels, was overshadowed by a row over the guarantees he will secure by the time of the referendum. The BBC reported that the prime minister accepts that every EU member state will not have ratified his proposed revision of the Lisbon treaty by the time of his referendum.</p> \n<p>Cameron nevertheless declared as he emerged from meetings on the Greek crisis and migration at 1am on Friday that he was “delighted” the process of renegotiating Britain’s place in the EU had begun. “It has been a long night and we have discussed some very important subjects, but above all I am delighted that the process of British reform and renegotiation and the referendum that we are going to hold – that process is now properly under way … we have started that process.” </p> \n<p>The Guardian and other media organisations have reported in the past month that Britain may secure a binding agreement from other EU leaders to attach a protocol to the Lisbon treaty. But this would only be formally attached to the Lisbon treaty the next time it is ratified to embed wider EU reforms. Senior UK officials say that some member states have said they cannot be expected to amend the Lisbon treaty on behalf of the UK, only to see it vote to leave the EU.</p> \n<p>A senior British official said that the prime minister is confident he will embed his reforms in a “legally binding and irreversible” process that will involve a revision of the Lisbon treaty. But the official said that the ratification of treaty change by all 28 member states, which can take years to complete, will not be completed by the time of Britain’s referendum.</p> \n<p>The official said: “There will be political agreement [of] 27 that these changes will be done. Then there is a process of ratification of those which can take a long time because it needs to be ratified in all 27 countries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"17ab2d662a78a6d92f54672aa46fa6c7d06cf9b6\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/17ab2d662a78a6d92f54672aa46fa6c7d06cf9b6/0_177_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hilary Benn, shadow foreign secretary, was among the politicians critical of David Cameron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hilary Benn, shadow foreign secretary, was among the politicians critical of David Cameron.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Gadd/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“So there will be a process that will need to bring the changes to the treaties into force. But are we absolutely clear that the reforms we are seeking will require treaty change and will need agreement on that treaty change before the referendum? Yes, we absolutely are.”<br /></p> \n<p>Another official added: “Will it be crystal clear and binding at the point that goes to the British people? Yes it will.”</p> \n<p>Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, said at the summit: “It sounds like a post-dated cheque. There are so many big fundamental things happening that a promissory note of some kind to Britain may well finish up not being honoured. Post-dated cheques can bounce and one suspects that any post-dated cheque that was given to the Brits would be given by presidents and prime ministers in office now.</p> \n<p>“By the time it came to be honoured there would be different prime ministers and different presidents who have been elected on a ticket saying we won’t honour this note anyway. It doesn’t work on any way you look at it.”</p> \n<p>Hilary Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, said: “All year the prime minister has been saying that change to the treaty was a definite requirement and yet now, faced with entirely predictable opposition from other member states, he is signalling retreat while pretending that all he ever wanted was a post-dated cheque.”</p> \n<p>The prime minister says he is confident that he will secure treaty change because changes to the governance of the eurozone will have to be embedded in the Lisbon treaty.</p> \n<p>But the summit will discuss plans for strengthening the euro over the next decade which have been deliberately structured to postpone treaty change until after 2017 specifically because of the British issue, senior sources said.</p> \n<p>The so-called Five Presidents report, from the leaders of the European commission, European Central Bank, European parliament, European council and Eurogroup, envisages a battery of integrationist moves up until 2025, some of which would require changes in primary EU law, but which are shelved for most of the decade.</p> \n<p>“This is the idea of the two-phase approach,” said a senior German politician in Brussels. “To deal with the British question and then to reopen the treaty.”<br />Senior politicians and officials in Brussels are not too exercised about the “ever closer union” formula, which would not be scratched from the EU treaties but could come with a footnote or protocol signalling that not all countries are bound by it.</p> \n<p>Top figures in Brussels point out that the current formulation on the “ever closer union of peoples” (not states) was wording actually won by a British Conservative prime minister John Major, during the Maastricht negotiations.<br /></p> \n<p>European leaders appear relaxed about this issue, but securing the kind of legal changes needed to facilitate Cameron’s aims on curbing in-work benefits for citizens of other EU countries working in Britain are seen as much trickier. Such changes would also be difficult to cover through what would effectively be a promissory note concerning post-referendum changes to labour and social legislation.<br />Farage, who appeared on the margins of the summit, waded into the row over the Queen’s speech at a state banquet in Berlin in which she warned of the dangers of division in Europe.</p> \n<p>Her speech was seen as a sign that she favours UK membership of the EU, although Buckingham Palace insisted the Queen was not making any comments on Britain’s EU membership.<br /></p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435256686340/522cacd7-1854-498a-a97b-f8fc5b843915-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ZUMA/REX Shutterstock/ZUMA/REX Shutterstock","altText":"David Cameron at the EU summit meeting in Brussels.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: ZUMA/REX Shutterstock/ZUMA/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/17ab2d662a78a6d92f54672aa46fa6c7d06cf9b6/0_177_3600_2160/3600.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2160,"width":3600,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hilary Benn, shadow foreign secretary, was among the politicians critical of David Cameron.

Starting life in Britain cleaning hotels, Horopcilic has since stopped working to raise her daughter, who was born in east London.

A family of three living in the ground floor front room paid &pound;180 a week, while the occupants of the basement were paying &pound;20 a week each.</p> \n<p>The landlady, Sithy Hussain, a widow from Sri Lanka, who lives nearby, says she had “no idea” so many tenants were living in the home. “Why should I get into trouble?” she asks. “I let the property in good faith.”Officials say in certain cases it is letting agents that are liable for overcrowding breaches; an agent from Orange Square property in East Ham, which let the home, threatened to call the police after finding the Guardian at the house. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1f88da878c8ec3ec4e54c5c6b27b41949ab7da8f\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1f88da878c8ec3ec4e54c5c6b27b41949ab7da8f/1517_832_1998_2996/667.jpg\" alt=\"Sithy Hussain\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The owner of the house, Sithy Hussain.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Russell Moffatt, private housing team manager at Newham council, says the evidence uncovered by the enforcement officers in the unannounced raid, coupled with the conflicting accounts given by the tenants, agent and landlady, underline the challenges faced by housing enforcement.</p> \n<p>“Quite commonly we’ll find landlords who work in conjunction with ‘head tenants’, who can be quite bullying and intimidating and they’re the ones who collect the rent and then pass that on to the owners,” he said.</p> \n<p>“The owners are normally aware, they often deny they’re aware – that’s how it works and that’s the way they can keep at arm’s length from a property but also receive all the money,” Moffat says.</p> \n<p>“As soon as you go back a couple of days later, the scene has clearly been dealt with. They remove a number of beds and that’s a natural reaction on their part. They know they’ve been caught red-handed. That’s why councils find it so difficult to take action.”</p> \n<p>Newham council was the first in England to introduce a licensing system for private landlords two years ago. It has to reapply for permission to renew its pioneering licensing scheme in 2017. About 35,000 private rental properties in the borough are licensed. So far, the council has banned 25 landlords, prosecuted 439 and recouped hundreds of thousands of pounds in fines and unpaid council tax.<br /></p> \n<p>Newham’s mayor, Sir Robin Wales, is adamant that unscrupulous landlords need to face tougher legislation. “Prosecute them, bar them forever and if I had my way I’d put them in prison,” he said. “I’d like to see bigger fines. I would take the property off them.”</p> \n<p>Earlier this week, the Labour mayor said his borough was “on the front line of the housing crisis”. About 40% of its housing stock was privately rented and tenants were subject to soaring rents and often dire conditions.</p> \n<p>“There’s not enough housing, we need to build more houses,” he said. “The government is responsible for making sure you can build homes.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fef9cb802f2693b11e9dfeb1cc3a531aec939c78/0_203_5760_3456/5760.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3456,"width":5760,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graeme Robertson for the Guardian","altText":"Newham basement room following council raid","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/cc0357d46a9c463bac8056b4cead1c118479058c/0_102_1456_874/1456.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":874,"width":1456,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The basement room before it was cleared by Newham Council.
