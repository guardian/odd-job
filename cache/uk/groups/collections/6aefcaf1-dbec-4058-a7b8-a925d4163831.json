But at this moment, what could be worse? We were in the middle of filming a documentary, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/mr-drews-school-for-boys\" title=\"\">Mr Drew’s School for Boys</a>, in a summer school for boys with behaviour problems. This was the one question I was hoping would not come up on camera.</p> \n<p>I’d been working with the students for only three weeks and my sexuality was something I just did not want to deal with right now. I had not told any lies, but I had certainly been economical – evasive, perhaps – with the truth.</p> \n<p>Now here we were, with TV cameras in front of us, and here was Tom, a boy with ADHD and a non-negotiable sense of right and wrong, whose question was not going to be brushed away. I could almost hear the whir of the zoom lenses focusing in on my face as I paused to consider the consequences of what I was about to say, potentially to two million viewers.</p> \n<p>“Miss, are you a lesbian?”</p> \n<p>“Yes,” came the reply.</p> \n<p>“You’re a liar,” he said. And it was true – I had been lying by evasion.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I feel I have normalised homosexuality for them. I’m not the lesbian teacher: I’m a teacher who happens to be a lesbian</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>As a teacher, when you’re in the company of children or teenagers all day, being openly gay can be pretty daunting. And here, there were cameras too. But now I’d said it and there was no going back. I desperately wanted for the kids not to care. I didn’t need their approval, but their disapproval would have stung.</p> \n<p>The documentary aired and Channel 4 decided not to out me to the entire nation. But I have learned that, for me, it’s best to be open. Mostly, I have been lucky: on the whole, I’ve worked in schools with realistic staff and accepting students. Even Tom from the summer school was fine once I had explained myself. Supposedly, he was one of the most challenging children in the country, but he didn’t feel the need to challenge me. He told me my sexuality didn’t matter, that it was fine and that I should never try to hide it. And that’s the joy of being a teacher: sometimes, your students have more wisdom than you do.</p> \n<p>Recalling the first time I was called a “fucking dyke” by a student still brings a sting to my face and so I had decided that, while filming, I would remain in the closet. This was just a summer school. The kids didn’t need to know my sexual orientation in order to work on their behaviour and their mathematics. But hiding such an integral part of me was hard while colleagues Mark, Ben, Dom and even Mr Drew himself so openly referred to their respective loved ones. So I referred to my partner in the plural “they” rather than “she” in the hope nobody would guess. You may think that seems ridiculous in 21st century Britain. But the same internal struggle is being felt by teachers all over the country every day.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2012/nov/26/gay-teachers-homophobia-stonewall-research\">Being gay at school remains difficult for teachers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Many (too many) are simply terrified of what it would mean for them if they were to be out at school. They’re afraid of leaving themselves vulnerable to personal remarks – ones that hurt – or of children asking for them not to be allowed in the PE changing rooms. These teachers are afraid parents will believe that, by talking openly about sexuality, they’re talking about sex and not about who people fall in love with.</p> \n<p>Throughout my 10-year career, I’ve tried various approaches, hiding my sexuality and then eventually coming out in different schools – sometimes through choice, sometimes after an unhappy sighting of me in a bar by a parent. Word soon gets around.</p> \n<p>As a newly qualified teacher, my outing was precipitated by a year 8 boy punching another boy in the face. The puncher arrived in my classroom, agitated, words pouring forth about the fact that he was going to be excluded.</p> \n<p>“Why did you hit him?” I asked.</p> \n<p>“He was slagging you off. He said … He said that you were a lesbian.”</p> \n<p>The boy was crying. I put my sandwich down, readying myself to answer his question and hoping that my response wouldn’t make him feel that his attempt at chivalry was utterly wasted.</p> \n<p>“I am.” Silence. “Oh shit,” he said.</p> \n<p>I couldn’t help but laugh.</p> \n<p>He received a fixed-term exclusion and I received a swarm of questions from all over. But the furore only lasted about a week: this was liberal Totnes, after all.</p> \n<p>My next school was somewhat less right-on. I outed myself with the students midway through my first year. They received my news with a unanimous “whatever”. A number of staff members, on the other hand, were less blas&eacute;. Was it not inappropriate for me to have a picture of my girlfriend in my office? The pictures of their husbands and children were, of course, beyond reproach.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/may/03/catholic-teacher-ohio-fired-being-gay\">Why I'm fighting the firing of a gay teacher at my Catholic school | Amanda Finelli</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One day a member of the senior leadership team called me into the office to ask me to “act less gay”. Really. Now, as a lesbian who wears dresses and heels, has long blonde hair and painted nails, the only way that I could imagine acting “less gay” was to actually not be gay. Perhaps that was her hope. I resigned as head of the sixth form.</p> \n<p>That taught me a lesson about not tolerating homophobia. Since then, I have been out in every school and talked openly with students about what it means when they use “gay” as a pejorative.</p> \n<p>I feel I have normalised homosexuality for them. I’m not the lesbian teacher: I’m a teacher who happens to be a lesbian. And nobody cares. Or, at least, it seems that way. But if you dig a little deeper, you find a whole raft of students and adults who do care: the bi-curious girl in year 8; the year 11 boy who has just come out; the transgender student in year 10; the cleaner whose daughter has just moved in with her girlfriend. All these people are made to feel safer and more accepted because I am out and I am safe and I am accepted. Without a doubt, having an out teacher in a school is invaluable when discussing diversity and tackling homophobia.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/jul/19/school-teacher-homophobic-bullying\">My return to the school where I was bullied for being gay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Unfortunately, the fact remains that of all the gay teachers I know, I am the only one who is out in the classroom. The sad reality is that not every gay teacher feels able to be out with their colleagues, let alone their students, and asking them to come out for the good of future generations is a big ask. It is asking the most vulnerable of our workforce to put themselves in the firing line.</p> \n<p>So what’s the solution? Surely, if things are going to continue to improve, staff need to bite the bullet? Well, yes. But what we also need is for heterosexual members of staff to shout the loudest. We need them to display Stonewall posters, openly refer to gay friends and relatives, remove the stigma of discussing sexuality – because they recognise that, despite the legalisation on gay adoption and gay marriage, facing your sexuality can be hard – for staff as well as students.</p> \n<p>If we can achieve that, then maybe we will be some of the way to reducing the 90% of LGBT students who say they have been bullied because of their sexuality or the 40% who self-harm. Perhaps, we could even reach a point where the majority of LGBT staff don’t feel the need to lie or hide. Surely, in 2015, that’s a reasonable enough goal.</p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434030022249/Lindsay-Skinner-with-pupi-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lindsay Skinner with pupils at Bridgwater College Academy in Somerset.

Through training for staff, briefings for parents and students and ongoing refinement of the curriculum, these schools are creating supportive, positive environments for all their students. I’ve had a number of teachers write heart-warming stories of being “out” for the <a href=\"http://www.outteacher.org/\" title=\"\">OutTeacher.org</a> website, which I set up in 2014. However, I’ve also had many people contact me who fear a backlash from parents if they discuss sexuality, or are open about their own sexuality.</p> \n<p>Often people feel cultural and religious objections within their communities. It is vitally important that schools work with local parents. However, they mustn’t lose sight of their responsibility for the children in their care.</p> \n<p>Some children grow up in an environment where they are forced to deny their natural-born identity, and told that the way they instinctively think and act is wrong. They will face confusion, upset, hurt and torment as they try to reconcile their love for their families with these messages.</p> \n<p>Let’s not beat about the bush: this is, plainly and simply, child abuse, even if it comes from ignorance rather than a lack of love. The damage to children puts them at greatly increased risk of suicide, self-harm, substance abuse and other serious mental health issues.

Before long, she was the second most powerful official in her ward. Four years later, they won","byline":"Linda Grant","body":"<p>There is something about defeat that brings people to the Labour party. In the week after the general election 20,000 new members signed up. That figure has now swelled to more than 40,000. Five years ago, days after Labour lost the 2010 election, I was one such person. I joined in a casual act of hubris that assumed party membership amounted to no more than an annual direct debit and a vague but satisfying sense of solidarity. I had always voted Labour, apart from a single Green protest vote in 2001. The sight of David Cameron and Nick Clegg smirking at each other in the rose garden, announcing their coalition government, drove me to ring the Labour party and give them my bank details, but it was never my intention to do anything other than vote in the leadership election. I am not one of nature’s campaigners or activists. I once had a column in the Guardian, in which my role was to snipe thoughtfully from the sidelines – as if critiquing policy made one a more serious person than the drones who did the manual work of fighting elections.</p> \n<p>Even if I had wanted to get involved, the constituency party lay in ruins, my local branch moribund and the membership list a shambles. There were no local leadership hustings because no one had got round to organising them. I didn’t know any of this. It took five months for emails to finally arrive inviting me to meetings, by which time the party leadership election had ended and, as far as I was concerned, my single task had been accomplished. At first I ignored the emails, then one night I turned up out of curiosity. It was an elementary error. By January 2012 I was the second most powerful official in the Crouch End branch of the Hornsey and Wood Green constituency party in north London. I would spend the next few years not so much a foot soldier as one of the pack animals of our parliamentary democracy, trudging the streets of my neighbourhood posting badly designed leaflets through letterboxes where they would, I was gloomily certain, be transferred directly into the recycling box, because that’s what I did with mine.</p> \n<p>It was seven months after I’d joined that I went to my first meeting. The constituency HQ was a shopfront in Middle Lane, in Crouch End. The dishevelled office was lined with papers, box files, piles of leaflets waiting to be delivered, rows of plastic stackable chairs and, on the walls, a series of old trade union posters from the turn of the 20th century – art nouveau designs of slender young women in flowing robes waving banners on which were inscribed inspirational slogans from the early years of Keir Hardie socialism. The place made me cringe – it was old Labour in aspic. But things were looking up: someone had managed to get Polly Toynbee and David Walker to come <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2010/oct/02/verdict-polly-toynbee-david-walker\" title=\"\">to talk about their new book</a>. I assumed that the crowd of 50 or 60 people was a normal branch meeting.</p> \n<p>At the annual general meeting the following month, to confirm the election of chair and secretary, there were eight of us in the room. Most of them I never saw again. A basic life skill of local party politics was explained to me by my brother-in-law the following day: when there is a call for the election of officers, on no account make eye contact. I suspect that the secretary elect was simply trying to rope me in when he asked, looking around, his large brown eyes coming to rest on me, if anyone would like to be membership secretary. I hadn’t even spoken yet. “What does it involve?” I asked timidly. “Just&nbsp;writing a welcome email to new members,” he replied. And I thought, well, OK, I could do that.</p> \n<p>Activists are the lowest rung of the political process, the worker bees of elections, annoying constituents by ringing their doorbells on Sunday mornings like Jehovah’s Witnesses, attending tedious community meetings at which niggles about refuse collection and perennial complaints about dog poo are rehearsed ad infinitum, and trying by devious means to recruit like-minded souls to share the leaflet delivery. I became very good at ensnaring unsuspecting naifs like myself into the inner circle. People are suckers for a story – my day job is telling them –&nbsp;and Hornsey and Wood Green had a narrative arc, one which would turn out to buck all the trends, delivering us a series of victories in the teeth of Labour’s national failure.</p> \n<p>Within five years we would elect two councillors and win the parliamentary seat back from the Lib Dems. It was an infuriating and exhilarating time in which I came to understand the seams and stitches of parliamentary democracy, the processes that hold the whole thing together, without which elections would be hollow echo chambers between the media and the voters. Without the dogged footslog of the activists, few people would ever meet anyone from a political party (supposing, of course, they wanted to). This is the story of how you rebuild a party from the ground up, not through winning ideological debates, though those do matter, but through the often banal life of local activism.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>The parliamentary constituency of Hornsey</strong> and Wood Green runs east to west, from Wood Green – an inner-city area of poverty, working-class voters and ethnic minorities that was one of the sites of the 2011 London riots – to Crouch End, Muswell Hill, Highgate, the homes of the despised metropolitan elite, cafe culture, private schools, arthouse cinema. Along this axis were three of the most potent issues of the 2015 election campaign in London: in the east the bedroom tax, in the centre Generation Rent, and to the west, specifically in Highgate, the mansion tax (there are around 2,000 properties that would have been eligible in the constituency, each a potential vote-loser).</p> \n<p>Hornsey and Wood Green is not a north London tribal constituency for any party, or even a marginal: it swings, and swings big. Barbara Roche won the seat for Labour in 1992 with a 5,000 majority, increasing to 20,000 in the 1997 Labour landslide. One of “Blair’s babes”, the cohort of new women MPs, she rose to become a Home Office minister with responsibility for the immigration and asylum bill. In 2001, the year I voted Green, her majority was reduced to 10,000 and in 2005 she lost the seat to Lynne Featherstone, the former leader of the Lib Dem group on Haringey council.</p> \n<p>The 2005 election was a sickening insight into what happens when a party’s activist base disintegrates. Looking out of my living room window it was blindingly obvious that Labour was going to lose. Teams of yellow-badged Lib Dem activists were pouring out of a block of flats opposite me. Rows of Lib Dem posters and garden stakes lined my road, but on the day of the election I had still not been visited by anyone from the Labour party. What altered the fortunes of both local activism and the result of the 2005 election was the Iraq war. “The war vote was cataclysmic,” said Steve Hart, then and now chair of the constituency party. “I remember the meeting on the night of the debate when the dodgy dossier was produced in parliament. There were 70 or 80 people there and Barbara Roche arrived holding the dossier. She came in, put it on the table hot off the press and I remember my heart sinking – there was a cartoon-like picture of a rocket on the front. I&nbsp;moved the motion to say that the case had not been made. We had a constructive debate that night and the [local] party voted against the war, though not by an overwhelming majority.” Barbara Roche voted with the government.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"81f03521a44420a25a2c68bac9affcf2f6ca8591\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434378671011/ddebefe0-ee97-4372-be8a-814338446557-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Linda Grant delivers her first (and last) political speech\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Linda Grant delivers her first (and probably last) political speech.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judah Passow</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hart is one of the road warriors of grassroots politics, always seen in jeans and trainers, ready to door-knock and leaflet-deliver at the drop of a hat. He is the son of the former Labour cabinet minister, Judith Hart, and in his youth the future home secretary Alan Johnson was the family postman. Until his retirement in May, he was political director of the Unite union. His involvement with Hornsey and Wood Green began in 1994. Two years later, in the runup to the Labour landslide of the following year, the local party reached its peak membership of 2,400.</p> \n<p>“One set of people dropped out in anger, another group had the stuffing knocked out of them,” Hart said. “A whole layer of people left. In 2005 a small number advocated a vote for Lynne Featherstone, which was even more divisive because there is no sin greater than supporting another candidate. It was nasty on the doorstep. People were screaming at you with real hostility, and it was particularly difficult if you agreed with them. By 2005 only half the branches were quorate – the rest didn’t even have the requisite minimum 10% of members turning up. The election campaign was really weak, all the way through it felt like it wasn’t going to happen, there weren’t enough people on the street. I’m not even sure if my wife voted Labour.”</p> \n<p>For the 2010 general election, Labour had selected a new candidate, Karen Jennings. Then head of health at the Unison trade union, she made little impression. “The mood hadn’t changed much,” Hart said. “We did better on the doorstep but&nbsp;the riff was, ‘Don’t be ridiculous, Lynne Featherstone would never go into coalition with the Tories.’” She increased her majority.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>The revival of the Crouch End branch</strong> had begun, unknown to me, in April 2010. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/natandoron\" title=\"\">Natan Doron</a> and his girlfriend, both in their mid-20s, were watching the debates between Gordon Brown and David Cameron on TV in a tiny rented flat in Crouch End. Natan is possibly one of the most refreshing people ever to join the Labour party, coming from a background as a singer and guitar player in “a little indie band” and with no Labour credentials at all. He had recently graduated from university and returned to London after working on campaigns for Greenpeace in Beijing, his political views shaped by climate change rather than economics and social policy.</p> \n<p>“It was watching the TV debates that I realised that I identified with the Labour movement,” he said. “I didn’t join or canvass but I felt quite guilty when Labour lost. I’d just got an internship with the Fabians and they asked if I was a member of the Labour party, so in the September I joined. I&nbsp;got a call from Liz Santry, the constituency Labour party (CLP) secretary saying thanks for joining but there’s no party for you to join at the moment, would you like to come to a meeting to see what we can do about it? I thought I was going to be at a meeting of hundreds of people. There were four of us: me, Liz, Matt Downie [then chair of the CLP] and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/verabaird\" title=\"\">Vera Baird</a>.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I thought I was going to be at a meeting of hundreds of people. There were four of us</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Natan Doron</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Vera Baird, a tall, bracing red-head born in 1950, was from a different generation, and a barrister who had represented miners during the 1984 strike. A former MP, she had lost her seat in Redcar in May 2010. For many years she had had her London home in Crouch End, a house on the main bus route that always hosted the largest Labour placard during elections. Within a few minutes she and Natan were asked if they would like to organise the branch: “This was my first human contact with the Labour party,” Natan said. “I didn’t know who Vera was, I had to look her up on Wikipedia. She gave me the admin work, I had no idea what I was doing but we called a meeting and 20 people turned up, some who had been members for a very long time and a couple of people in their 20s. I handed round a sheet of paper and pen and asked people to sign in. Because I had the paper and the pen it was assumed that I was the secretary, and that is how I became the secretary.”</p> \n<p>Matt, then head of parliamentary and public affairs at the charity <a href=\"https://www.actionforchildren.org.uk/?gclid=CLeJxLTakcYCFVMatAodDgUApA&amp;gclid=CLeJxLTakcYCFVMatAodDgUApA\" title=\"\">Action for Children</a>, was thinking about how the branches could function between elections. He brought an unlikely element to local politics: warmth. He was always looking at the human element of party life, how people treated each other, how political parties often split into warring factions and how this could be avoided. His concern now was “complacency, a refusal to admit that the anachronistic and strange world of CLP politics was off-putting”, he said. “When we weren’t being an election machine, we were a loose-knit bunch of weirdos in need of intellectual stimulation. And the more we learned to let go of the political processes, the more fun it got and the more people got involved.” At this point there were no immediate elections to campaign for and no candidates, so he instituted pizza and politics nights, partly as fundraisers, partly as a way to keep people interested and to try to expand the membership. That was the temptation I had succumbed to when I turned up to listen to Polly Toynbee and David Walker.</p> \n<p>Once I started my new role as membership secretary, I discovered that the database was chaotic. It consisted of a Gmail account’s contacts list. The problem was that names had been added to it who were not members, so I decided to give myself the task, unsuited to my unmethodical nature, of trying to reconstitute it. I had to get the official membership list from the constituency party’s membership secretary and match up the names from each list and set up a new database. This took weeks. Information was patchy and incomplete. Many of the members had no email address, some because they had joined before email was invented, or before anything you could reasonably call a computer was invented. Others had changed their email address or had moved out of the constituency without informing the party. A few did not have or want email.</p> \n<p>I didn’t mind delivering my first batch of leaflets. It was a bit of exercise and it made me usefully familiar with the options for front door colours and the different designs of letterboxes and garden gate fastenings. The question was whether there was any point in doing it. The problem with all this door-to-door activity was that people were annoyed with you for cluttering up their halls with what they regarded as junk mail and even more annoyed when you banged on their door on a Sunday morning to ask them how they felt about local issues (one woman told me she thought the council should do something about the stocking levels at Waitrose). But if you didn’t interrupt their weekend or push leaflets through their letterboxes they complained that “We only ever hear from you during elections when you want our vote.”</p> \n<p>In my very minor role as membership secretary, I decided that if there was one useful thing I could do for the party, it was to go round and hand deliver a personal letter to every member whose email address we did not have. It produced results and a few started to come to meetings. Looking though the list, I realised that some of my friends were dormant members. It would do no harm, I thought, to try to reactivate them. (I was already thinking like a party functionary.) I brought back in from the cold a TV comedy writer with superb contacts in the standup scene, who was happy to organise fundraisers for us.</p> \n<p>One of the names I noticed was Martin Bostock, whom I had first met in the 1980s when he was head of press at Hackney council, overseeing the media response to rate-capping, Tory restrictions on council spending. Martin had gone on to found his own PR company with major clients, including Sony PlayStation and Canon. He was one of the people who had joined the party before the invention of email. When I met him for coffee one afternoon he was about to retire and had just had a hip replacement operation. “Look,” he said, “I don’t mind getting involved, as long as I don’t have to deliver any leaflets.” Of course not, I said, we wouldn’t dream of asking you.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a687376772e84e97789c8b3b62148a5808768940\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434379623046/e5b2d84b-0ce7-4e39-80d4-b18acaeae484-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Party activists listen to Ed Miliband speak at a rally in Crouch End, north London during the 2015 general election campaign\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Party activists listen to Ed Miliband speak at a rally in Crouch End, north London during the 2015 general election campaign.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Judah Passow</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I began to realise that we had a problem with our membership. The most active, the ones who came to meetings, fell into two categories. The first were baby-boomers who had bought run-down houses and restored them to family homes. Most of them worked in the public sector and had been party members since their 20s. Mainstays of the branch were Michael and Hilary Jacobs, both had grown up in working-class Jewish families; he is a retired lecturer in pharmacy, she is an artist. They were always available to do the legwork of the branch but felt their time serving on committees was over. At the other end were the young renters: recent graduates, who had energy and commitment but worked late, missed meetings as a result and tended not to stay long in the area. What was missing in the middle of our demographic were those in their 30s with young children. It occurred to me that the reason for their absence was that if they could afford house prices in Crouch End, where a two-bedroom flat without garden cost &pound;400,000 and rising, they might not be inclined to any variant of socialism.</p> \n<p>With the reconstitution of the membership list and the reactivation of sleeping members, I thought that my role as Labour party functionary had been fulfilled more or less, when Vera Baird, who had started to campaign to become Northumberland police commissioner, resigned as chair. Natan took over and he asked me if I would become secretary. What could that involve, I thought, apart from taking minutes? By this time we were doing quite well: the Observer columnist <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nickcohen\" title=\"\">Nick Cohen</a> had been in to talk about freedom of expression, the Guardian opinion editor <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jonathanfreedland\" title=\"\">Jonathan Freedland</a> on the prospects for the next general election (not great, with Ed as leader, he warned), Lord Faulkner on the alternative vote referendum, and we were getting large turnouts.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The Crouch End branch began to develop a reputation for being vibrant, friendly, energetic and even a bit cool</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We always made sure everyone was invited to the pub afterwards to continue the conversation. As Matt Downie had told me, there was always going to be one member who tried to dominate meetings, telling everyone else where we were going wrong and we had one (had we thought of establishing an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/28/edible-bus-stop-promising-patch-of-possibility-to-blooming-success\" title=\"\">edible bus-stop</a>?) but the Crouch End branch began to develop a reputation for being vibrant, friendly, energetic and even a bit cool. Other branches were told to take note of whatever we were doing right, but what that was, I think, was Natan’s energy and optimism, my contacts and our proximity to central London. We were a miniature powerhouse operating in one neighbourhood on top of a pile of natural advantages over constituencies far from the capital. And still it was all Iraq, Iraq, Iraq on the doorstep, while a friend campaigning in Sheffield said no one talked about Iraq – there the key issue was the economy, the economy, the economy.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>At the ant-like level of branch membership,</strong> the national party had made no impact on me until this point. We were never consulted about any policy, nothing ever rose from the grassroots up. In the summer of 2013, we began the process of selecting parliamentary and council candidates. Now we were informed that we were to have an all-female shortlist. The frontrunner for our prospective parliamentary candidate was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/local-government-network/2013/aug/16/catherine-west-islington-council-women-working\" title=\"\">Catherine West</a>, then leader of Islington council, who lived half a block outside our constituency. She had an impressive track record of campaigning for the living wage and against cuts to the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/education/education-maintenance-allowance-ema\" title=\"\">educational maintenance allowance</a>. She had run against Karen Jennings to become candidate for Hornsey and Wood Green five years earlier and lost; now it seemed obvious that that had been a mistake. Catherine was elected by a landslide at a meeting attended by hundreds of members that June. With a prospective parliamentary candidate we felt less adrift; our campaign for the general election two years later at last had a face and a name to put on the endless bloody leaflets.</p> \n<p>In the autumn, we began the process of choosing council candidates for the local elections that would take place in May 2014. This proved to be the most mentally taxing and exhausting two months of my life. Each of Haringey’s 19 wards elects three councillors. The procedure involved hopeful applicants being interviewed by a Labour party panel before they could apply for a seat. At the Tottenham end of Haringey there were mainly safe seats; anyone really keen on becoming a councillor would want one of these. The wards were ranked on the basis of potential winnability, with Crouch End, Muswell Hill, Stroud Green, Fortis Green and Highgate at the bottom. We were the insurance places, the ones people applied to in case they were not selected higher up the chain. The juggling act involved advising members to shortlist people who, I had to guess, would not be snatched away from us by being selected somewhere more promising. I can’t fault the Labour party’s commitment to eradicating gender inequality, but it reduced me to a frayed knot of anxiety as I rang around trying to find applicants. It was an unbreakable rule that one of our candidates had to be a woman but fewer women than men had applied to the panel – there weren’t enough of them to go round.</p> \n<p>Natan was only interested in representing Crouch End so we didn’t have to try to prevent him from being selected elsewhere. Jason Arthur, 25, had narrowly missed selection in Tottenham. “A rising star,” as one veteran member shrewdly remarked when she read his CV. Born on a Crouch End council estate, he had become the first black president of his Oxford junior common room and spent two years teaching in one of the most deprived areas of London. I managed to talk Lourdes Keever, a recently retired probation officer with extensive knowledge of the impact of Haringey’s social services, into being our female candidate.</p> \n<p>Once selected, the three of them, Natan, Jason and Lourdes became a formidable team of activists, each with different skills and interests: Jason, who had been a member of the Labour party since his early teens, was the veteran campaigner; Natan was the blue-sky thinker and idealist; Lourdes had a human understanding and empathy for the impact of austerity. On the night of the 2014 council elections we all turned up to the count at Alexandra Palace. Natan and Jason were elected, Lourdes sickeningly missed by fewer than 100 votes. Ward after ward went Labour. Only Highgate now had no Labour councillor. The party had taken seats in some of the most middle-class wards, including Muswell Hill and Fortis Green, reducing the Lib Dems from 27 to nine seats.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>In January 2015, Lord Ashcroft’s poll</strong> for Hornsey and Wood Green predicted Labour on 43%, with a 13% swing from the Lib Dems. Once we had councillors, the life of the branch altered. Natan and Jason moved from being activists to elected politicians, held weekly surgeries (where local residents bring their problems) and were formally committed to campaigning in the runup to the general election. With Labour councillors, we had more influence with the decision-makers. Jason was immediately appointed cabinet member for resources and culture, responsible for the future of the town hall. We still had speakers but everything was now subordinated to general election campaigning. All the pundits were saying that Lynne Featherstone would lose the seat, but on the ground, we were worried that her personal popularity and her responsibility for seeing the equal marriage bill through parliament would save her. In March, the Lib Dems commissioned their own <a href=\"http://survation.com/\" title=\"\">Survation</a> poll, showing Labour only a single point ahead.

Catherine West asked me if I would speak as a local member and supporter of her campaign, after a lineup of neighbouring MPs and the journalist <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/owen-jones\" title=\"\">Owen Jones</a>. Steve Hart handed me the megaphone. I pointed behind me to Waitrose and said that it was shameful to walk in there for balsamic vinegar and Ottolenghi recipe ingredients, past the food bank collection box. Why, in one of the wealthiest constituencies in the country, where residents were moaning about the mansion tax, were we collecting food for hungry families? Jason Arthur, talking after the election, remarked: “Our seat looked like what Ed Miliband wanted the whole country to look like, a liberal electorate and a young energetic campaign team.” We voted Labour in Hornsey and Wood Green because we were doing OK, apart from the housing crisis, and we wanted to mitigate the effects of austerity on others who lived often only a 10-minute drive away in our own constituency. Unlike the shires or the suburbs, we saw all around us the effect of coalition policy. But we were about to learn how atypical we were of the rest of the country.</p> \n<p>On the day of the election. I went to the centre of Crouch End. Natan and Jason were handing out cards with the details of our candidate at the bus stop, a lot of people were taking them. At nine, I took over from Martin Bostock at the Hornsey library polling station on telling duty – getting the polling card numbers so we could tick off those who had promised to vote for us and door-knock those who had not yet voted. Martin was driving round the polling stations picking up the polling data and taking it back to our campaign HQ at Michael and Hilary Jacobs’s house, where manically energetic activists<strong> </strong>were diving in for short periods to grab coffee and biscuits before joining Jason and Natan who were leading five-strong teams banging on people’s doors asking if they’d voted yet and if not when would they?</p> \n<p>I’d made arrangements to go to the count at Alexandra Palace. The result was expected around 3am. At 10pm<strong>, </strong>I watched the exit poll and couldn’t face it. I had a bath and went to bed. I slept for a few hours. When I woke up at 4.45am, the result had been declared. Catherine West had won with an 11,000 majority, a 19% swing. The turnout was 73%, the second highest in a Labour seat and the second highest Labour swing.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>After the election, a lot of people</strong> in the constituency said that we were always going to win, that Lynne Featherstone entering the coalition had sealed her fate four days after the last election. If this is true, then does local activism matter? “Were we going to win anyway?” said Matt Downie. “Probably, yeah. All we needed was a candidate prepared to say ‘bedroom tax’ a lot, but there’s a difference between an asset and a deficit campaign, we didn’t want to just win it, we wanted to smash it, to give Catherine 10 years.”</p> \n<p>If we probably won because the national swing against the Lib Dems was so great, what then do those five years of activism represent: the five years of leafleting, membership list reconstruction, the pizza and politics evenings, the door-knocking, the meetings on wet winter nights when the apologies for absence were greater than the number of attendees? Our most annoying member had said, with monotonous regularity, that the electorate decides how to vote on the basis of what it sees and reads in the national media and that local campaigning is irrelevant. But for me, it was a means of breaking through that distancing, the mediation of the columnists, political analysts, Question Time and Newsnight, to understand how a political party actually functions and what you have to do to rebuild one. I was tired of being a passive, critical spectator of the political process; I wanted to try to change the government and this remains the only real way of doing that.</p> \n<p>So, what will become of the 40,000 new Labour members? Some, like me, will go to a meeting, and possibly not even by mistake. Now that elections happen on TV and YouTube and Facebook and Twitter, and not at rallies or on soapboxes, local activists are the only members of a political party most people will ever meet, the only people they can argue with on their own doorsteps. The local party is where political careers begin, in the basin of community politics, where the local hospital, primary school places, social housing allocation, bin collection, bus services, youth clubs, meals on wheels and libraries are how people experience the political system. And they are the people who see what happens to communities when those things stop working properly, are cut back, go under, disappear.</p> \n<p>Daily life is what we are really talking about when we talk about politics – how the remote ideas of thinktanks manifest themselves in neighbourhoods. The lowest branches of our political parties are where democracy lives, breathes, thrives, and is at its most fallibly human. This activity, invisible to the media, perhaps faintly embarrassing to the parliamentarians, is much more than a like on Facebook, or a <a href=\"https://www.change.org/\" title=\"\">Change.org</a> petition signature, or a demo or a sit-in. Without it, there is just a distant political class. A month after the election I met Martin Bostock for coffee again. I persuaded him for run for chair. Without difficulty.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Follow the Long Read on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/@gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a></p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434378422755/f3eacccd-1595-4473-95a6-1c11408c9544-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Judah Passow","altText":"A Labour party supporter waits for Ed Milliband to address a rally in front of Hornsey Town Hall in Crouch End, North London, in the final days before the 2015 General Election.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Judah Passow"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434378672394/ddebefe0-ee97-4372-be8a-814338446557-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Linda Grant delivers her first (and probably last) political speech.

measures such as paid paternity leave seen as vital to getting men more involved in parenting and easing burden shouldered by mothers</p>","byline":"Peter Walker","body":"<p>Encouraging men to become more involved as fathers is the key to achieving gender equality, according to a landmark international study that shows women remain overwhelmingly more responsible for childcare and domestic duties despite their increasing role in paid employment.<br /></p> \n<p>Hands-on fathers also help produce happier and better-educated offspring, as well as gaining significant benefits to their own physical and mental health, the inaugural State of the World’s Fathers report argues.</p> \n<p>The 288-page report, an analysis of almost 700 studies on the subject from every nation for which data is available, highlights the continuing gender disparities over childcare and other domestic duties. </p> \n<p>Despite now being 40% of formal workforce globally, women still spend between two and 10 times longer then men caring for children or older people, and there is no country where men and boys share unpaid domestic and care work equally with women and girls.</p> \n<figure class=\"element

\n</figure> \n<p>A key part of the problem is a lack of official support for involved fatherhood, with paid paternity leave either non-existent or very brief in most counties, said the report, produced by <a href=\"http://men-care.org/\">Mencare</a>, an international NGO campaigning on fatherhood that has links to groups including <a href=\"http://promundoglobal.org/\">Promundo</a> and <a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/\">Save the Children</a>.</p> \n<p>“Unless men and boys participate equally in unpaid work in the home, and unless governments, employers and families expect and support this involvement, gender equality will not be achieved,” it argues. “Men’s emotional lives and their wellbeing and happiness will continue to be constrained, and they and their children will miss out on one of the most significant relationships of their lives.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\"

</figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The study, published to coincide with Father’s Day this Sunday, identifies the massive gender imbalance in childcare and other unpaid domestic work as a key element of the problem. Even <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/gender/data/timespentinunpaidpaidandtotalworkbysex.htm\">across the developed nations of the OECD</a> women undertake an average of twice as much domestic duties as do men, with the ratio rising to <a href=\"file:///Volumes/Downloads/Internet%20Downloads/TUS%202000%20Report%20(2).pdf\">eight times as much in South Africa</a> and <a href=\"http://www.unrisd.org/unrisd/website/document.nsf/(httpPublications)/F9FEC4EA774573E7C1257560003A96B2?OpenDocument\">10 times more in India</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>One <a href=\"http://paa2004.princeton.edu/papers/41801\">study cited by the report</a> found that even between 1965 and 2003, married, employed men in 20 industrialised nations, including the UK and US, contributed on average only an extra six hours a week to domestic chores. Nowhere <a href=\"http://asr.sagepub.com/content/71/4/639.abstract\">did the time spent by men exceed 37% of that of women</a>.</p> \n<p>This disparity helped explain why women <a href=\"http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2015/4/op-ed-on-progress\">earn on average 24% less than men around the globe</a>, the report noted. Father who participate in childcare and other domestic duties tend in turn to bring up boys more likely to accept equality, it added, while the daughters of men who share domestic chores are more likely to aspire to higher-paying jobs.<br /></p> \n<p>The report’s authors call for governments to introduce more ambitious paternity leave entitlements. While more than two-thirds of fathers say they would happily work less to spend more time with their children, of the 92 nations currently giving paternity leave <a href=\"http://worldpolicyforum.org/sites/default/files/WORLD%20Fact%20Sheet%2005%20Parents%20and%20Children%20English.pdf\">about half offer less than three weeks</a>. More generous provision has “the potential to transform gender relations”, the study argues, noting <a href=\"http://worldpolicyforum.org/sites/default/files/WORLD%20Fact%20Sheet%2005%20Parents%20and%20Children%20English.pdf\">UK research</a> that found fathers who took time off after their children’s birth were much more likely to help with duties like night feeds even a year later.</p> \n<p>The report stresses the wider beneficial effects of more paternal involvement, saying involved fathers have been shown to boost their children’s cognitive development, mental health and social skills. Men who say they have close connections with their children tend to live longer, happier lives, and are more productive at work.</p> \n<p>More benefits still occur when fathers are actively involved before their children’s birth, the study found, with men’s presence at antenatal visits being linked with fewer woman dying in childbirth and, in more developed nations, with better rates of breastfeeding.</p> \n<p> While 80% of men around the world will become a biological father during their lives, the authors say, the issue of more parental and domestic involvement by men is “virtually invisible in public policies and in public discourse”. </p> \n<p>Nikki van der Gaag, an academic and author who co-wrote the report, said the findings were crucial in efforts to boost equality: “When fathers take on their fair share of the unpaid care work, it can alter the nature of the relationships between men and women and children, as both fathers and mothers will have more time for their children, women are released from some of their double burden, and fathers get to experience the joys, satisfactions, and stresses of caring for their children.</p> \n<p>“Taking up roles as caregivers also offers men the opportunity to begin to break free from the narrow concepts of manhood and fatherhood, providing their sons and daughters with positive role models, improved health and development, and higher hopes for the future.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434435639741/d093ece2-dfd1-4076-a438-b64776884b6d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jack Sullivan/Alamy","altText":"Equality in the household leads to better outcomes for fathers, mothers and their children, a study has found.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jack Sullivan/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T06:22:51Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T06:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":21,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Walker","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterwalker"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Men's health","Parents and parenting","Family","Health & wellbeing","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/mens-health","webTitle":"Men's health"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Walker","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterwalker"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/fathers-need-support-to-spend-more-time-on-children-and-chores-report","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49npy","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/fathers-need-support-to-spend-more-time-on-children-and-chores-report","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/fathers-need-support-to-spend-more-time-on-children-and-chores-report"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434435639741/d093ece2-dfd1-4076-a438-b64776884b6d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Equality in the household leads to better outcomes for fathers, mothers and their children, a study has found.

The opposition parties, led by the normally pro-European Liberal party, announced they would back David Cameron in his quest for renegotiation to prevent the EU turning into a “social union”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b88bdd6292daedc93d33de627bb885cde4b16eb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943512576/fd5b676a-6929-4ab3-ae58-ed508515764d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Danish opposition leader Uffe Elbaek of The Alternative is photographed at its headquarters in Copenhagen\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danish opposition leader Uffe Elbaek of The Alternative is photographed at the party’s headquarters in Copenhagen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Kastrup/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The eurosceptic Danish People’s party looks set to cement its position as Denmark’s third-biggest party after the election, and the agreement was seen as another sign of its renewed pressure on the opposition for wider EU reforms.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Everyone now has to deal with us – whether they like us or not</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Uffe Elb&aelig;k</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“A very powerful Danish People’s party will have implications,” said Kasper Fogh Hansen, a political commentator and former Social Democratic campaign adviser. “Denmark is on a political trajectory where people are very skeptical about a European community that can’t handle the migration of workers and the pressure of immigrants and refugees. The political direction will be the same whether it’s a red or blue government, but there might be more draconian measures from the right.”<br /></p> \n<p>As Denmark earlier this month celebrated the centenary of its constitution and women’s right to vote, Thorning-Schmidt spoke outside the parliament building, Christiansborg, amid a sea of red banners and the reverberating bass from a nearby soundsystem. She was preceded on stage by a male dance performer wearing only a pair of sand-coloured skimpy shorts, as early summer sun and street parties engulfed Copenhagen. The prime minister put party politics aside in her speech, but the battle for Borgen was preoccupying the crowds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0642c992923e1014c954c7bbc911f9f185c53104\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943917528/a1b8bfad-d37c-4e2a-8f44-08b36c399ba2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Danish royal family and prime minister at Christiansborg in Copenhagen.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Danish royal family and prime minister at Christiansborg in Copenhagen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Splash News/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I want her to continue in office but it has not worked as well as I thought under the current centre-left government,” said Karen Wolf, a 57-year-old business consultant from Copenhagen.</p> \n<p>“I’m disappointed that they haven’t carried through with some of their ideas – but the opposition is a frightening prospect.”</p> \n<p>Broken promises – from a proposed congestion charge in Copenhagen to a cap on student numbers in school classes – have been recurring points of attack for the opposition, which has led opinion polls since the last election. Social Democratic voters have been dismayed by what they see as a shift to the right for the party, including a toughened stance on immigration. Selling a stake in Denmark’s biggest utility to Goldman Sachs put the government on the brink of collapse, while speculation has been rife over Thorning-Schmidt’s future as she was touted for a top EU job.</p> \n<p>But the last three weeks have seen a remarkable comeback by the prime minister and her red bloc, who have turned around a large poll deficit to leave them neck and neck with the opposition before Thursday’s vote. Part of the reason for this, and the biggest obstacle on the road back to power for the centre-right blue bloc, is a series of expenses scandals that have dogged the Liberal party leader, Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen.</p> \n<p>“We can chose between two leaders with a character problem,” the newspaper Politiken wrote in an editorial after the election was called. “Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen apparently doesn’t have any personal character, while Helle Thorning-Schmidt doesn’t have any political character.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"440ada6caa1d9f9e9a34620bc77be789e1765951\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434295405309/f74fecf5-7c6b-43f9-9fda-c69ab18fd416-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Danish Liberal party leader Lars Loekke Rasmussen running for office\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danish Liberal party leader Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen running for office.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gonzales Photo/Demotix/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d1b453b8ac2841dba0d7ca6bbafdbb8fe8dece6e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943563488/5a3cd675-2994-4c35-a6ea-4da8d466e71d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Helle Thorning-Schmidt poses for a selfie with a voter in Ringsted\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Helle Thorning-Schmidt poses for a selfie with a voter in Ringsted.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ole Jensen/Demotix/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Turning the focus from politics to personalities appears to have played into the hands of the incumbent prime minister.</p> \n<p>“Thorning-Schmidt was never popular,” says Fogh Hansen. “She was just a lot less unpopular than her opponent. If the blue bloc loses this election, it is down to the very poor choice of keeping a thoroughly scandalised Rasmussen as their candidate for prime minister. But their politics are victorious.”</p> \n<p>According to Martin Krasnik, a TV anchor for national broadcaster Danmark’s Radio, personality has never before played such a crucial role in Danish elections, something which he says has generated fertile ground for new political parties, including The Alternative.</p> \n<p>Krasnik said: “The crucial divide in Danish politics no longer runs across the centre. The two main parties – the Social Democrats and the Liberals – do everything they can not to position themselves on either side on major issues such as integration, asylum, economy and security. Now, the divisions can be found further out on the edges, and that’s why the most interesting discussions are taking place among the other parties.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434363356174/8449f807-5b37-4243-a703-ef013f8641d1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"SCANPIX DENMARK/Scanpix Denmark","altText":"Uffe Elbæk of The Alternative visits Skagen in northern Denmark, as part of his election campaign","cleanCredit":"Photograph: SCANPIX DENMARK/Scanpix Denmark"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434363576991/d26861c3-2802-4580-b195-087916d0f01b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thorning-Schmidt speaks at a political festival.

Rows over what to do about Greece or bankers may come swathed in a tarpaulin of jargon, or bearing a roof-rack of technicalities, but really they’re about the big stuff: who gets what and from whom, and what makes a society worth living in.</p> \n<p>Which makes austerity the biggest political debate in Britain today. Last week George Osborne vowed at Mansion House to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/12/academics-attack-george-osborne-budget-surplus-proposal\" title=\"\">make budget deficits all but illegal</a>; next weekend there will be a <a href=\"http://www.thepeoplesassembly.org.uk/end_austerity_now_national_demonstration_saturday_20th_june\" title=\"\">national demonstration against the cuts</a>. These events will look very different – a bunch of penguin suits discussing finance over a slap-up dinner versus an army of trainers tramping in protest at the human fallout of the past five years. Yet they are the yin and yang of the debate over what kind of country the UK should be.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/12/academics-attack-george-osborne-budget-surplus-proposal\">Academics attack George Osborne budget surplus proposal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But there’s a mismatch – and not just of wardrobes and accents. Many critics of austerity fail to grasp the vastness of the political project that it serves. Take the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/12/osborne-plan-has-no-basis-in-economics\" title=\"\">letter from Thomas Piketty and 76 other top economists</a> carried in the Guardian on Saturday, warning that any law against the government running an overdraft (which is all a budget deficit is) would eventually crash the economy.</p> \n<p>Completely right, but also rather beside the point. If the government begins saving more in taxes than it spends on schools, hospitals and pensions, then – as the academics argue – someone else will need to spend more to keep the economy ticking over.</p> \n<p>The extra billions could come from businesses investing in new equipment, or from foreign countries buying far more goods and services made in the UK than we buy from them. But since our post-industrial nirvana doesn’t go in for investment or export booms any more, what’s far more likely is that ordinary Britons will plunge deeper into debt. The UK’s future prosperity will be perched atop a house of credit cards – with a little extra help from Wonga.</p> \n<p>The real fault with Osborne’s budget law isn’t its outcome – it’s the intention. Governments pass ridiculous legislation all the time. In his last days at No 10, Gordon Brown forced through an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2011/apr/04/government-ignoring-child-poverty-act\" title=\"\">act making child poverty illegal</a>. That law will be broken, but no prime minister will be banged up. Similarly, Osborne could outlaw government borrowing – but that would mean the chancellor lugging his own <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/17/guardian-view-britains-choices-economy\" title=\"\">&pound;90bn overdraft</a> down to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2014/feb/18/pentonville-prison-london-critical-inspection-report\" title=\"\">Pentonville</a> for a stretch inside. For all their jibes, the Tories don’t have the best form as savers – official records show that Labour administrations racked up more budget surpluses than they did.</p> \n<p>The point of this law isn’t the letter, but its spirit. Osborne wants to use an apparently obscure, highly technical change in the economic rules to reshape British society. He says as much in his Mansion House address, calling it a “permanent change in our political debate” and “a new settlement” for the UK. Unlike in 2010, the chancellor is no longer claiming these cuts have been forced upon him – now he’s promising&nbsp;they’ll be good for us.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/10/guardian-view-on-george-osborne-fiscal-surplus-law-micawber-delusion\" title=\"\">This isn’t the cosy Micawber</a> of Dickens: it’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2011/jul/31/tea-party-economics-could-get-the-whole-world-in-a-stew\" title=\"\">Tea Party economics</a>, where a movement funded by billionaires proposes that everyone else tighten their belts. It echoes Margaret Thatcher’s description of her own programme: “Economics are the method; the object is to change the heart and soul.” The Iron Lady issued that pledge in 1981: over the next nine years she certainly made good on it.</p> \n<p>So what is Osborne’s promise? What’s the existential change packed inside the austerity project? To find out, you should turn to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/wolfgang-streeck\" title=\"\">Wolfgang Streeck</a>. As co-director of the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies, Streeck ranks among the top political economists in Germany – and in his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/economics-blog/2014/apr/27/booming-britain-running-smoothly-growth-dont-believe-hype\" title=\"\">stunning recent book Buying Time</a>, he lays out a thoroughly researched argument for where Britain and the west are heading. It is far more interesting than the usual ad hominem attacks on David Cameron and Osborne – but, be warned, it is the stuff of cold sweats.</p> \n<p>Streeck argues that Britain, the US and mainland Europe have been through two major political settlements since the second world war. First came what he calls the tax state: where countries provided doctors and teachers and benefits – paid for largely out of tax revenues. Then came Thatcher and Reagan. At the urging of the wealthy and big businesses, they slashed taxes. To remain politically viable, however, they provided similar levels of public services and welfare to the mass of voters.</p> \n<p>The cliche is to blame greedy voters for wanting ever more stuff from their governments. Streeck’s research demonstrates the opposite – that the fault lies with the wealthy opting out of the tax system: “Those who have profited most from the capitalist economy have been paying too little … into the public purse.” The result was that across a range of rich countries tax revenues hardly grew, even as spending continued climbing. Governments filled the gap by borrowing: this is what Streeck calls the debt state.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>What we expect from Whitehall or our town halls will come instead from G4S, Serco, Atos</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The debt state comes with two big problems. First, as governments become more and more in hock, their creditors in banks and pension funds have more of a voice in democratic politics – sometimes more influence than the voters. Asked in 2007 who he fancied for the upcoming US election, Alan Greenspan, the former head of the US Federal Reserve, shrugged: “It hardly makes any difference who will be the next president. The world is governed by market forces.”</p> \n<p>Second, the prospect always looms of markets refusing to lend your country any more easy money: just as happened between 2008 and 2010. Followers of Keynes correctly argue that the state can rack up more debt than rightwingers believe – what they overlook is how that erodes and finally destabilises&nbsp;democracy.</p> \n<p>First rich countries taxed and spent, then they borrowed and spent. What happens now? As you heard from Osborne, they propose to cut – and not spend half as much. This is what Streeck names the consolidation state: where what we expect from Whitehall or our town halls is pared back or comes instead from G4S, Serco, Atos.</p> \n<p>This is what’s really at stake on Saturday’s march and the austerity wars. This isn’t just about Bullingdon boys running amok, but an orthodoxy largely accepted by Labour and across the west, even in Sweden. Under the guise of a budgetary crisis, our politics, our public realm, our society stands to be remade. And it can’t be changed back.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434394542898/Illustration-by-Bill-Brag-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration by Bill Bragg","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Illustration by Bill Bragg","cleanCaption":"Illustration by Bill Bragg"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T06:00:12Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T06:00:12Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":121,"contributors":[{"name":"Aditya Chakrabortty","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/24/1411565194870/Aditya-Chakrabortty-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/adityachakrabortty"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Austerity","George Osborne","Economic policy","Politics","Conservatives","Economics","Business","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"business/austerity","webTitle":"Austerity"},{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"politics/economy","webTitle":"Economic policy"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Aditya Chakrabortty","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/adityachakrabortty"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/george-osborne-austerity","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zf2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/george-osborne-austerity","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/george-osborne-austerity"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434394542898/Illustration-by-Bill-Brag-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Unlike in 2010, the chancellor is no longer claiming these cuts have been forced upon him – now he’s promising they’ll be good for us.’ Illustration by Bill Bragg","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Illustration by Bill Bragg","cleanCaption":"‘Unlike in 2010, the chancellor is no longer claiming these cuts have been forced upon him – now he’s promising they’ll be good for us.’ Illustration by Bill Bragg"}},"importance":1,"byline":{"title":"Aditya Chakrabortty"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"cutout","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/24/1411565194870/Aditya-Chakrabortty-L.png"}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-06-16T08:10:01Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/6aefcaf1-dbec-4058-a7b8-a925d4163831","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/6aefcaf1-dbec-4058-a7b8-a925d4163831"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"front"}
