It is the most ridiculous, bold, life-affirming and gloriously overblown celebrity transition ever. Until now, no one had ever come out in such style. </p> \n<p>The cover is instantly iconic, up there with other Vanity Fair masterpieces like <a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2011/08/demi-moore-201108\">the pregnant Demi Moore</a>. Caitlyn Jenner is not messing about. She couldn’t have picked a more provocative, attention-grabbing and, let’s face it, fabulous way to introduce herself to the world had she arrived at a press conference, on a beach, floating on a golden conch shell. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/01/caitlyn-jenner-bruce-jenner-vanity-fair\">'Call me Caitlyn': Jenner owns her identify in Vanity Fair interview</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I’m sure this sexualised image of a woman in her 60s will provide people with plenty to criticise, but for me it brings nothing but joy – and, though I don’t speak for them, I suspect many other trans people will feel the same. There have been plenty of people waiting for her to come out looking a mess, ready to ridicule her. Look who’s had the last laugh now. My Twitter feed reckons she looks a bit like Jessica Lange, or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2013/jun/22/breaking-bad-anna-gunn-santa-fe-albuquerque\">that woman who played Walter White’s wife on Breaking Bad</a>, and she has a touch of the former supermodel about her too.<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESW1AncRzeg\"> Bow down, bitches. </a></p> \n<p>Caitlyn Jenner is fit, healthy and rich, so may well have decades of long, enjoyable life ahead of her. At 65, however, she is not young, and she’s making up for lost time. When she was growing up, society was ignorant of trans issues; her parents and community didn’t have the information that could have helped her become who she was always meant to be while she still had her whole life ahead of her. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/VanityFair/statuses/605406096824647681\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Caitlyn Jenner poses for Annie Leibovitz on the cover of Vanity Fair <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/CallMeCaitlyn?src=hash\">#CallMeCaitlyn</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/NRyh6R09RR\">http://t.co/NRyh6R09RR</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/GO1ZgJJKBR\">pic.twitter.com/GO1ZgJJKBR</a></p>— VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VanityFair/status/605406096824647681\">June 1, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Jenner has endured years of hiding who she is, of trying to live up to other people’s expectations of who she was supposed to be and, more recently, cruel tabloid speculation, ridicule and bullying. After going through all that, her time has finally come. To see her looking so happy on the cover of Vanity Fair is a triumph. I love that the cover doesn’t even mention her old name; every journalist should follow the magazine’s lead.</p> \n<p>When Kellie Maloney, former boxing promoter to Lennox Lewis,<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/04/kellie-maloney-boxing-sex-change-operation\"> came out as trans last year</a>, the more miserable quarters of the chattering classes cruelly asked: “What does a man in his 60s know about being a woman?” It was the wrong question. A better question is: “Why did this woman feel like she couldn’t be herself all those years?” Caitlyn, like Kellie, has always been a woman. Yes, even when they were “fathering” children. Gender is what’s inside – and for Caitlyn, finally on the outside too. </p> \n<p>Let’s be clear. Caitlyn Jenner is not your average trans person. Her lifestyle is so rarefied very few could realistically aspire to it. She has money for surgery. The majority of transgender people – who face such hideous discrimination in the job market, not to mention social and familial rejection – do not. </p> \n<p>Many trans people are forced into sex work in order to pay for the medical aspects of gender transition, and often this puts them at risk of drug abuse and physical harm. I’ve been there myself. I live in Britain, where transgender people are entitled to surgery and psychotherapy on the NHS – but even here we have to pay for things such as laser hair removal, seen as a “cosmetic” luxury by the NHS, but essential for any trans woman cursed with thick stubble. In the US, health insurance varies from state to state, leaving some transgender Americans covered, others to fend for themselves.</p> \n<p>That doesn’t mean Caitlyn Jenner’s transition isn’t significant. We need trans people from all walks of life challenging perceptions at every level of society. Transgender knows no boundaries when it comes to age, race or social class. As <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/17/true-trans-laura-jane-grace-aol-show-transgender-people\">Laura Jane Grace</a>, another American trans hero, pointed out to me on Sunday, Jenner matters culturally – and we need people who inhabit that space to complement the work being done at grassroots level to improve life for trans people. </p> \n<p>For years, we’ve been bombarded with stories about adult transitions and the complications and misery these inevitably entail. But stories like this will become a thing of the past as awareness about trans people spreads to parents and doctors. More and more parents are supporting their children when they come out as trans, and around the world trans teens are accessing treatments that delay their puberty and give them time to decide what they really want to do with their bodies as they mature. If we can help, love and support trans kids, the idea of the messy social transition – which so intrigues the public – will cease to exist. I can’t wait for that day.</p> \n<p>Things are changing. And fast. Thank you, Caitlyn, and good luck, girl. Say what you like about her dramatic transition, but as far as I’m concerned, there’s only one appropriate response – “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A1xyy1D0Yk\">Yass queen!</a>”</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Paris Lees will be chairing a Guardian Live event - <a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-live-how-to-be-happy-and-transgender-16479241856\">How to be happy and transgender</a> at Amnesty International on Thursday 4 June.</li> \n</ul>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433184576786/75a4543e-324d-4bef-9e70-07c933a0a283-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"HANDOUT/Reuters/Vanity Fair","altText":"The most glamorous transition ever: Caitlyn Jenner shot by Annie Leibovitz.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters/Vanity Fair"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T06:22:13Z","lastModified":"2015-06-02T06:22:15Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":391,"contributors":[{"name":"Paris Lees","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/paris-lees"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["US television","Television","Culture","Television & radio","Transgender"],"tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/us-television","webTitle":"US television"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"society/transgender","webTitle":"Transgender"}],"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paris Lees","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/paris-lees"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"tv-and-radio"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/01/caitlyn-jenner-vanity-fair-cover-life-affirming","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49d54","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/01/caitlyn-jenner-vanity-fair-cover-life-affirming","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/01/caitlyn-jenner-vanity-fair-cover-life-affirming"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433184576786/75a4543e-324d-4bef-9e70-07c933a0a283-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The most glamorous transition ever: Caitlyn Jenner shot by Annie Leibovitz.

The&nbsp;Conservatives actually campaigned on a manifesto pledge&nbsp;to get rid of human rights and people voted for it. As electoral choices go, it’s not far off&nbsp;choosing to be ruled by a dry, whispering voice&nbsp;taunting you from an antique mirror.</p> \n<p>Here, in what may well be the final years of our civilisation, I would like to ask a question that has been worrying me for some time. What if David Cameron is a genius? A shrewd and malevolent psychopath who thinks two moves deeper into the game than any of his opponents? What if there sits in Downing Street today <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN7DYPJLXkc\" title=\"\">a modern-day Moriarty</a>, living in a world where his schemes are only kept in check by the deductive brilliance of Harriet Harman? As Holmes would say, look at the evidence. Cameron has managed to set England against Scotland, Scotland against&nbsp;Labour. He&nbsp;has&nbsp;given his enemies the referendums they asked for, and won. He has left Nick Clegg looking like one of those terrified mouse faces that you find in an owl pellet. He has successfully pursued an agenda more radical than Thatcher’s with less popular support than John Major.</p> \n<p>Most impressively, Cameron has managed all&nbsp;this without anybody being terribly worried by&nbsp;him. Immediately after his re-election he announced: “For too long we have been a passively tolerant society, saying to our citizens so long as you obey the law we will leave you alone.” A statement so far to the right that it conceded the political centre ground to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-eI5oLlIeY\" title=\"\">Judge Dredd</a>.</p> \n<p>We have an idea of Cameron as an empty suit – he’s remarkably forgettable for someone who has a face like a gammon travel iron. What if this is simply a character he chooses to play? We can see the mileage Boris Johnson has got out of playing the fairly simple character of a sort of pissed-up dandelion. What if Cameron’s persona&nbsp;is actually more crafted and insidious?&nbsp;He has&nbsp;a brisk, stiff air of wishing he was somewhere else. We imagine he would much rather be a few years in the future, heading up some foundation that’s advising Qatar on how to bid for the Winter Olympics. Perhaps that’s quite an effective manner to adopt when robbing a country. Announcing in a clipped voice that you’ll be out of our hair just as soon&nbsp;as&nbsp;you’ve privatised the NHS, terribly sorry&nbsp;for&nbsp;any inconvenience. Cameron having a down-to-business persona is not terribly unlike one of those gangs who do heists in high-vis jackets.</p> \n<p>Speaking of which, I’ve always thought that Batman hired Robin simply to draw fire: throwing a teenage boy a bright yellow cape&nbsp;and telling him to run through a darkened warehouse full of goons. There seems to be little difference in <a href=\"http://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/michael-gove-adjusts-his-ceremonial-robes-as-he-arrives-at-news-photo/473962200\" title=\"\">getting Michael Gove to dress up in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bib and plus fours</a> and throwing him into a roomful of barristers. Gove’s appointment as justice secretary seems to be somewhere between a sardonic trolling of the judiciary and simple misdirection. If he ever does have to produce a Bill of Rights it will be a Producers-style clusterfuck that draws attention away from all&nbsp;the&nbsp;real business of the government.</p> \n<p>Why else would he have put Gove there? Are&nbsp;we to imagine that his priority in choosing someone to draft tricky legislation was that they have a face that’s easy to carve into a pumpkin? Gove is a distraction for a robbery, who has been hired to be a kind of human bin fire. When the real business of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership ratification is under way, he’ll be wheeled out on Newsnight looking like a treefrog trying to escape from a scrotum and the whole culture will stop to take aim.</p> \n<p>It’s time we accepted the true depth and horror of Cameron’s genius. In the run up to announcing a legislative programme entirely composed of the sort of things the Sheriff of Nottingham would yell at villagers as threats, he&nbsp;had everybody talking about foxes. He’s introducing the bulk interception of our emails and the only feeling it seems to have provoked from the public is mild arousal. He got quarter of a million people to sign a petition for a Human Rights Act referendum that they would definitely lose (British people think the European court of human rights is all about making sure that Ian Brady can get Netflix or marmalade or something). Indeed, Cameron had us all talking about human rights legislation while quietly pursuing a TTIP trade deal that will make human rights meaningless compared with those of corporations.</p> \n<p>And there we may have the real clue to Cameron’s manner. He is a sort of bored viceroy engaged in the handover of power from government to corporations. He has a detailed idea of what life will be like 10&nbsp;years down the line, when sovereignty is subordinated to corporate courts. He probably feels that, in context, we are churlish to get upset at this colourful, Lannisterish little government he&nbsp;has got together for the handover. Imagine the wry&nbsp;contempt the master criminal must have felt for Holmes, living at the centre of the brutal British empire and imagining that Moriarty’s little crimes were the worst thing in&nbsp;the world.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433175579241/The-Moriarty-of-Downing-S-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Moriarty of Downing Street?

This isn’t Statham boasting – it’s more a casual aside – but we both know he’s not joking, either. I’m tempted to challenge him to do it without the crash pad, though there’s the possibility he’d win the bet by disabling me with a dinner plate to the throat, hurling me off the balcony with him, and using my body as a human cushion, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEFq2j7Hb3Q\">like he did a few years ago in the movie Safe</a>.</p> \n<p>Statham is one of the most distinctive brands in cinema. You know exactly what type of movie you’re getting when you see his name above the credits, and you can be sure that’s really him doing the balcony-jumping, car-chasing and choreographed ass-whupping. He’s the man with the deadliest skills, the maddest stare, the strongest cranium, the graveliest growl. When he punches the air, the air screams in pain.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a503775dd9874b8dd40b96dd20063e166a27948\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433185155646/0e6698c6-8648-4161-b02e-a36a455ade5d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jason Statham in Spy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Statham in Spy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Except now Statham might have blown his cover. In his new movie, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/spy\">Spy</a>, written and directed by Bridesmaids’ Paul Feig, he’s scene-stealingly hilarious. Melissa McCarthy is the dependably funny and surprisingly physical heroine of this gleeful action comedy, but equally revelatory is Statham, playing a chauvinistic English secret agent. He’s everything James Bond isn’t: sweary, vulgar, not very good at being secret, and by no means the sharpest tool in the agency’s box. He’s confused to learn there’s not actually a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLGD8g7pTfo\">“face-off machine”</a> that can change his identity, and he’s given to listing the absurd punishments he’s taken in the line of duty, from ripping off his own arm to impersonating Barack Obama – all delivered with an impeccably straight face. He’s basically a brilliant parody of himself.</p> \n<p>“Paul was saying, ‘Look, just don’t try and be funny. That’s not what I want,’” says Statham. “It harks back to Guy Ritchie saying, ‘Don’t try and act. That’s not what I want!’”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLGD8g7pTfo\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLGD8g7pTfo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There’s no mad staring or growled threats with the real-life Statham. He’s friendly and attentive, even if you get the sense he’d rather jump out of the window than go through another interview. He enjoyed being out of his testosterone comfort zone doing Spy, it seems. If he had any anxieties about playing second fiddle to smart, funny women like McCarthy, Rose Byrne and Miranda Hart, he’s not admitting to them. More challenging was Feig’s way of working. He encourages improvisation, and is in the habit of dreaming up new lines mid-scene and handing them to his actors on Post-it notes. </p> \n<p>Statham might have the edge when it comes to leaping from tall buildings, but when it comes to verbal dexterity, he’s happy to bow to McCarthy. “She was just … great,” he says, amused by his own inarticulacy. “For myself, it’s not something I’ve been accustomed to experimenting with.”<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/mar/16/spy-review-paul-feig-melissa-mccarthy-jude-law\">Spy review –&nbsp;uproarious Paul Feig comedy tickles SXSW</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Feig wrote the part especially for Statham. He’s a big fan, it turns out. He’d seen all of Statham’s movies – “even the bad ones” – and he clearly recognised something that becomes apparent watching Spy: Statham has been a comedian all along. Many an absurd story would have been impossible to buy without Statham’s unwavering deadpan. Like the one where the hero can only survive by committing high-adrenaline acts such as having public sex and driving through shopping malls (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/113998/crank\">Crank</a>). Or keeps his artificial heart charged by attaching jump leads to his tongue and rubbing up against polyester-clad grannies (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/129194/crank\">Crank 2</a>). Or assassinates someone by ambushing them from the bottom of their swimming pool, then moves the corpse’s arms and legs from underneath to make it look like they’re still having a swim (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/140086/mechanic\">The Mechanic</a>). </p> \n<p>Statham has been keeping a straight face for some time, I suggest, half-tensing in case he decides to shove my dictaphone into the side of my neck. He laughs. “I get paid too well <em>not</em> to keep a straight face.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_6w6hBnXAg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t_6w6hBnXAg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Statham’s school-of-life ascent is almost the stuff of legend now. His acting skills were acquired hawking cheap costume jewellery on London street markets. The athleticism was encouraged by his father, who was a boxer and gymnast. “He taught me to do a handstand practically before I could walk. I could do somersaults and backflips from a very early age.” That led to diving, and a place on the national team, but not the success he craved. “You have to start when you’re five years old; when I started at 12, it’s way late. You need pro coaches; my coach was a chartered accountant.” </p> \n<p>Guy Ritchie took a chance on him with Lock, Stock …, Luc Besson took another with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/94659/transporter\">The Transporter</a> in 2002, and it’s been a succession of strenuous B-movies and increasingly lucrative franchises ever since. His previous movie, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/fast-furious-7\">Fast &amp; Furious 7</a>, is now the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/13/global-box-office-reese-witherspoon-and-sofia-vergara-stall-in-hot-pursuit\">fourth-highest-grossing of all time</a>, having taken more than $1.5bn worldwide.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSodvRnD3Qc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wSodvRnD3Qc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Statham’s comfort zone has never looked the slightest bit comfortable, mind you. It’s exhausting just reading about his punishing <a href=\"http://www.menshealth.co.uk/building-muscle/get-big/the-complete-jason-statham-workout-106592\">training regimen</a>: rowing machines, circuit training, weights, sprints, rings, trampolines. Having said that, he recently divulged he also likes to <a href=\"http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/interviews/a35122/jason-statham-cover-story-0615/ \">get drunk and float about in his Los Angeles pool</a> with his girlfriend, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/oct/06/rosie-huntington-whiteley-lingerie-model \">Rosie Huntington-Whiteley</a>. “It’s been feast and famine,” he admits. “I’ve had untold years of burning the candle: going out, overeating, over-drinking. Even when you do it, you understand you can’t live that way. As you get older, you get a bit wiser.” He’ll be 48 next month. Given his new comedy direction, could it be he’s easing out of the action game?</p> \n<p>He shakes his head. “I really like doing action movies. It’s opened the door for me and I’ve had a great career out of it. Why not continue doing something I’ve always wanted to do?”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456225303__\n</div> \n<p>The problem is, in today’s movie landscape, Statham is facing competition from all directions. On the one hand, there’s a conveyor belt of superhero contenders muscling in on his turf; on the other, you’ve got actors such as Liam Neeson, Denzel Washington, even Colin Firth, taking late-life detours into action movies. </p> \n<p>Not to mention the Expendables old guard, including Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who refuse to retire. Statham doesn’t begrudge the latter: “They were my heroes growing up. Sly Stallone is a real athlete; he gets stuck in.” But he’s riled by the number of phoneys he sees around him.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/jason-statham-action-hero-spy\">Jason Statham: our last action hero (50 million Facebook fans can't be wrong)</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“They are not doing what they’re supposed to be doing,” he says, becoming more animated. “I’m inspired by the people who could do their own work. Bruce Lee never had stunt doubles and fight doubles, or Jackie Chan or Jet Li. I’ve been in action movies where there is a face replacement [that “face-off machine” really does exist] and I’m fighting with a double, and it’s embarrassing.

They’re not doing anything! They’re just sitting in their trailer. It’s absolutely, 100% created by stunt doubles and green screen.

It has its own element of black comedy but very slick, very sophisticated.”</p> \n<p>At this point certain dots start to join. Viva La Madness is written by JJ Connolly. It’s a sequel to Connolly’s Layer Cake, in which Statham’s character was played by Daniel Craig. Layer Cake was credited as Craig’s audition for James Bond. Craig has announced this year’s Spectre will be his last Bond movie. Statham would be a wild card choice for the next Bond, but why not?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ef29c4fe4de0a4ba6c991ae3021282e4610f707\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433185074542/9f600bdd-667e-4983-b716-8e01ca5fcace-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jason Statham in The Transporter 2\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Statham in The Transporter 2</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Could I do it?

And talking his talk can hardly be an issue with a character whose accent has fluctuated between Sean Connery’s Scottish brogue and Timothy Dalton’s Welsh. Added to which, Statham’s self-made, by-the-bootstraps backstory is surely more in tune with modern Britain than the traditional public-school elitist Bond biography. “Yeah, I’d make a decent Bond,” he says. “But it’d be very, very different if I did it.”</p> \n<p>What about a Bond villain?</p> \n<p>“Er …” he hesitates. “I don’t know if I wanna to do that.

It’s inevitable what goes up must come down.” Keeping his feet on the ground might be the wrong expression when it comes to Statham.

Alan Yentob turned me down’</p>","byline":"Interviews by Dave Simpson","body":"<h2><strong>Kay Mellor, creator and scriptwriter</strong></h2> \n<p>I was going to a party with my husband and we drove up Lumb Lane in Bradford, which was famous for prostitution. As we drove, I saw this young woman – she’d got a miniskirt on in November and her legs were mottled blue. When she looked right in our car it was as if somebody punched me in the solar plexus. She was a child. It bothered me all night.</p> \n<p>I was working for a crisis centre and someone there said: “Why don’t you write about it?” I’d done bits and pieces for Coronation Street and Brookside, so a couple of days later, we drove up there and started talking to the women. They knew the girl I’d seen – Tracy, from Birmingham. We never found her again, but she lived in my brain.</p> \n<p>There were hardly any women writers then, certainly not in drama and definitely not wanting to put <a href=\"https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/band-of-gold/series-1/episode-2-caught\">northern prostitutes on TV</a>. I’d go to awards ceremonies and accost Alan Yentob, who turned it down. Then ITV came in – it took me eight years from conception to get it to the screen [1995].</p> \n<p>Researching the series completely changed the way I viewed prostitutes. They lived on the edge but were lovely, fascinating, warm people that either sold their bodies to feed their kids or because they were controlled by a pimp.</p> \n<p>Several of the characters were based on real people on Lumb Lane. This was before mobile phones, so whenever I wanted to talk to any of them, I’d ring the pub.</p> \n<p>I met a woman who became the inspiration for Carol, played by Cathy Tyson, who I’d seen in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu9stsH1k6k\">Mona Lisa</a>. In the end I couldn’t tell the difference between her and Carol: she just devoured the character. If Cathy thought Carol wouldn’t wear something she’d go: “No fucking way, I’d look like a bloody social worker in that.” But she was right.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40d98631e4ec68cd13e292686dd8d16ff8931dfb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433159630674/2759b366-e5c7-4f5e-bc54-1df6c5a95e4d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kay Mellor - screenwriter.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I don’t like seeing violence against women, so I left most of it to the imagination’ … writer Kay Mellor.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Samantha Morton had a tiny part in Peak Practice, which my daughter Gaynor was in. She came home and said: “Mum, there’s this girl. She’s going to be a big star.” Samantha didn’t look like the girl on Lumb Lane, but there was something similarly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5cnZQzobak\">vulnerable and damaged about her</a>. Later, I realised <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/video/2014/sep/12/samantha-morton-sexually-abused-child-care-homes-video-interview\">she was drawing on real-life</a> experiences. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIJz0efR5CA\">When filming stopped, she’d still be Tracy</a> – which was disconcerting for the crew, but maybe that’s why she is brilliant.</p> \n<p>The random acts of violence mostly went unseen. I don’t like to see violence against women, so left most of it to the imagination. I’d lived in Leeds through the Ripper murders and the storyline about a man killing women was my way of exorcising those really dark places we were forced into as women, when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOADw3BBPBE\">we lived in terror</a>.</p> \n<p>There were <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/volcano-of-tension-was-ready-to-erupt-1586043.html\">riots in Bradford</a> when Band of Gold was first shown, so we had to shoot series two in Manchester. But it was groundbreaking television that gradually changed the perception of prostitution.</p> \n<p>I took some of the women to the press launch in London. The real Carol got all dressed up and the press asked: “Which ones are the prostitutes?” We never said. She’d always told me: “I don’t want paying, Kay. I just want you to show me as a human being, not a hustler.” At the end, she turned to me and said: “Thank you.” I was so moved, my eyes filled with tears.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cathy Tyson, actor</strong></h2> \n<p>I was worried about being typecast playing prostitutes after <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fu9stsH1k6k\">Mona Lisa</a>, but this was different: domestic, with a child involved. I had to do it. I did some research on my own, walking into dangerous areas. I met the ladies and taped them, and I met their pimps. It was foolish, really, but I had to break down my own prejudices. Once, I walked through the streets of Bradford in a short skirt and high heels, looking suggestive. People looked at me with disgust, but I wanted to see what these women faced on a daily basis.</p> \n<p>Carol was an amalgamation of several women I met. I respected what they put themselves through – all that danger, then these double lives, taking kids to school. Up close, the effects of those “late nights, early starts” really struck me, so I asked the crew to nicotine stain my teeth. I was so obsessive back then that one cameraman worried that I was seriously depressed, but I was bringing up a son with no father figure and my worries fed into the character.</p> \n<p>We had some laughs, though. I particularly bonded with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0ttsXyTcIA\">Geraldine James</a>, who played Rose, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMD_eUhIals\">Barbara Dixon</a> was really funny. The scene where Steve Dickson [as Ray] stuffs bank notes into my mouth was a great image, but uncomfortable to do. When the pimp is chasing me into the warehouse, we’d rehearsed it, but I went flying. The cameras stopped and everyone went: “Oh God! She’s really hurt!” I stood up and said: “Don’t worry. It’s acting.”</p> \n<p><strong><em> <br /></em></strong></p> \n<ul> \n <li>The third series of Kay Mellor’s The Syndicate begins on 2 June at 9pm on ITV. </li> \n <li>Cathy Tyson’s play, <a href=\"http://www.pitchlakeproductions.com/project--she-called-me-mother.html\">She Called Me Mother</a>, tours in autumn 2015.<br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Culture","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433158747624/4d2745a6-a562-4d8e-a28d-4a537c91224d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ITV/Rex Shutterstock/ITV/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Band of Gold, series 1, 1995 … Geraldine James, Barbara Dickson, Cathy Tyson and Samantha Morton.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: ITV/Rex Shutterstock/ITV/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433159632134/2759b366-e5c7-4f5e-bc54-1df6c5a95e4d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘I don’t like seeing violence against women, so I left most of it to the imagination’ … writer Kay Mellor.
