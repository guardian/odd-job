It has one of the largest calderas in the world, offering myriad viewpoints over its twisted, pitted landscape. Aso town can be reached by train (one hour from Kumamoto, two from Beppu, fares between &pound;6 and &pound;12). There are <a href=\"http://www.kyusanko.co.jp/aso/lang_en/\">two cable car lines, called ropeways</a>, from which to explore the Aso area. Aso Nishi (west) cable car station is a short bus ride from Aso station (&pound;3 each way). Aso Higashi (east) cable car station can be reached by taking a local train to Miyaji station and then walking up the road to the cable car station. A toll road (about &pound;3.50) goes right to the summit of the crater where there is a large car park. There is a lot to explore within the caldera but visitors must remember to check on accessibility before setting off: Aso is a gassy beast and its emissions often see areas of the caldera closed off.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>More information at </em><a href=\"http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4552.html\"><em>japan-guide.com</em></a><em>.

A convenient gap in the crater walls means visitors can disembark straight into the volcano without having to do any climbing. Whakaari, 49km off the North Island coast, last erupted in 2013 but it is fully suitable for guided tours, thanks to its relatively stable nature and intense monitoring, although its current branding by scientists is “restless”.

Visitors will see solidified lava flows from down the centuries reaching right into towns and villages, and craters at all levels of the mountain. It is these side fissures that still pose the biggest risk to Catania – which was destroyed by an eruption in 1669 – and nearby villages. The best route up is on the south side via the Catania suburb of Nicolosi. From here, drive, cycle <a href=\"http://www.aziendasicilianatrasporti.it/\">or take the twice daily AST bus</a> (which starts in Catania) up to the <a href=\"http://www.rifugiosapienza.com/\">Rifugio Sapienza</a> (at 1,923m), where tickets can be bought for the combined cable car and 4x4 bus trip, <a href=\"http://funiviaetna.com/versione_inglese/index.html\">Funivia dell’Etna (€60pp)</a>, to the highest-possible level. The ticket price also includes a guided tour around a large, smoking crater next to an observatory. A more sedate way of exploring the volcano’s environs is by train. The scenic <a href=\"http://www.sicily-holiday.com/en/train-and-subway-sicily/circumetnea-around-etna\">Circumetnea Railway</a> travels around the base of Etna from Catania Borgo to Riposto and costs about €8pp, taking three hours.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Live Etna activity updates at </em><a href=\"http://www.volcanodiscovery.com/etna/current-activity.html\"><em>volcanodiscovery.com</em></a></p> \n<h2>Mount Vesuvius, Naples, Italy</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55ffd85504eb22c8c1e5dfb974333e9a5404ef4d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432658078991/c11e7707-ea66-4b20-b3bc-f32201bd025f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"School group overlooking Mount Vesuvius Crater, Campania, Italy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arctic Images/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Possibly the world’s most famous volcano – though it hasn’t erupted since 1944 – and the most touristy, too. So much so that serene contemplation of nature’s ferocity might not be possible given the crowds who ascend each day. At 1,281m it would only be the fifth highest mountain in the UK but its squat form lurks sinisterly over Naples. From the car park at 1,000m visitors climb the remaining 200m (about 30 minutes, tickets €10). The most popular path goes to the edge of the main crater where guides are on hand. Steam can be seen rising from parts of the crater and, as with nearly all volcanoes, there is a strong smell of sulphur. There are no public toilets or a visitors’ centre (although there is the historic museum observatory halfway up the road from Ercolano) but the views are spectacular and the sense of history profound. The nearest railway station is Ercolano Scavi, from which minibuses and taxis take you up the mountain car park in about 25 minutes. <br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://www.vesuvioexpress.info/i-nostri-percorsi.html\"><em>Vesuvio Express</em></a><em> bus costs about €20 including admission to the trails and crater.

Although it’s a modest size, it is a tough climb to the summit, but climbing skills are not necessary. Factor in up to six hours: three hours up, one hour to view the crater, and 1&frac12; hours down. Use of a guide is obligatory above a point at 400m called the Sciara del Fuoco. Even from here any belch of magma at the summit should be visible. In any case, mild explosions – appearing at dusk like giant roman candles – happen on Stromboli, sometimes every half hour. Guided trips to the summit crater from the Sciara leave late in the day so the fireworks can be appreciated in full. The attractive trail to the Sciara starts in Piscit&agrave;, about 2km west of Stromboli’s port. Organised treks to the crater depart daily, timed to reach the summit at sunset and to allow 45 minutes to observe the crater’s fireworks.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://www.magmatrek.it/en/\"><em>Magmatrek</em></a><em> runs guided trips along the whole trail from Stromboli village (€28 adults, €25 kids under 14).

At 1,247m it’s not even the tallest volcano on Hawaii (it’s dwarfed by the 4,169m Mauna Loa) but it has been belching out huge quantities of deep crimson, slow-moving lava almost continuously since 1983. Fortunately for visitors, catastrophic explosions are not Kīlauea’s style – beautiful lava fountains are. There is no public transport within the area, <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/kvc.htm\">a national park</a>, so the choice for exploring rests between car hire and private excursions. The Kīlauea Visitor Center and <a href=\"http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/jaggar_museum.htm\">Jaggar museum</a> offer extraordinary views of the lava lake within the Halema’uma’u crater.

The mountain has “mild-to-moderate explosive activity” and lava flows, although during 2015 it has entered a quiet period. The best route up the hill is from the village of Toya Bungkah because from here much of the climb is through shady forest. The village is also, handily, HQ to the Association of Mount Batur Trekking Guides (open 3am-1pm). The entire area is volcanic and the higher Mount Agung dominates the south-eastern horizon. The view of forest, volcanoes and lakes is superb but often clouds build up during the afternoon, obscuring the view. For this reason – and to catch the sunrise from behind Agung volcano, the guided trips set off at about 3am. Although the climb is relatively easy, trips are best undertaken with a guide (about &pound;20 from Toya Bungkah). Some travellers have reported over-aggressive touts offering trips up the mountain, but whatever the logistical irritations, the views over Lake Batur and the various live craters should make it worthwhile.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://www.balitrekkingtour.com/mount-batur-trekking/\"><em>Bali Trekking Tours</em></a><em> offers excursions to Batur from several locations in Bali from US$65pp including transport, guides and breakfast.

You want the status, yes, but you also want the perks: the free laundry, the free haircuts, the endless on-site activities, and all the cereal you can eat. That doesn’t just sound better than your job: it sounds better than your life.</p> \n<p>That’s what former Googler Brandon Oxendine felt, anyway. For three months in 2012, he eschewed more conventional living arrangements to set up home in his car in the Google car park. Yes, Brandon technically lived in a station wagon when he could have had his own place somewhere in Silicon Valley. But, for all intents and purposes, he lived in Googletopia, and he loved it – despite the practical complications. “I had told everyone I had moved into San Francisco,” <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29146961\">he told the BBC</a>. “But I was always coming up in the same outfit from the parking garage.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/may/27/new-office-pests-modern-work-life\">The new office pests: how many are there in your workplace?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Brandon’s experience might be a little extreme but, for most workers, it will ring a bell; where once the division between work and leisure was pin sharp, it’s now unnervingly hazy. We send emails to our bosses at 11pm, and play table football instead of going to meetings. “There’s no doubt that this is a phenomenon of contemporary work life,” says <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/jul/03/cubed-secret-history-workplace-nikil-saval-review\">Nikil Saval, author of Cubed: A Secret History of the Workplace</a>. “Work bleeds into everything else.” And so does the place where we do it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5dcf1b3e710e12d872fa2ba4b273b992eba49f8c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432661079583/e1ac1e04-f691-4bb2-8699-e4c559996452-460x317.jpeg\" alt=\"We all want to work somewhere with soft-play breakout areas and a slide in the atrium, and so big companies need more space to accommodate us.\" width=\"460\" height=\"317\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We all want to work somewhere with soft-play breakout areas and a slide in the atrium, and so big companies need more space to accommodate us.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Solent News/REX_Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That’s one explanation for a remarkable piece of news that emerged from a Deloitte study last week: over the six months to March this year, the amount of new <a href=\"http://www.cityam.com/215981/construction-booming-city-companies-vie-office-space\">office space being built in central London was up by 24%</a>, to a total of 9.5m sq ft. That’s an area about the same size as Battersea Park, and the second-biggest increase in 20 years. Meanwhile, offices were in such demand in the capital last year that rents rose by 7.7%. And British Land, a major landlord, saw a <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/constructionandproperty/11605781/Office-space-race-in-London-sends-British-Land-to-greater-heights.html\">12% rise in the values of its properties</a>.</p> \n<p>You might attribute this boom to Silicon Valley’s trickle-down: we all want to work somewhere with soft-play breakout areas and a slide in the atrium, and so big companies need more space to accommodate us. But there’s a problem. At the same time this is happening, there’s a deep shift in the exact opposite direction – there is a rise in technologies that make remote working a piece of cake, and shared office space has become a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/small-business-network/2014/feb/04/third-spaces-flexible-solution-working-move-sme\">booming business in its own right</a>. “In any industry 15 years ago, they would all have had huge offices with pictures of them shaking hands with the Queen,” says Tim Robinson, head of property asset management at Knight Frank and chair of the judges at last year’s <a href=\"http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/launch.aspx?eid=aa6ea8d3-6c30-4914-8eea-e37202e54526\">British Council for Offices awards</a>. “But most of that has gone away now. Nearly everyone else is flexible space.” These days, he observes, nearly all offices are open plan.</p> \n<p>So flexible that most of us could earn our living in our pyjamas. For some tasks, yes, we’ll always need to meet face to face – but, for the most part, we’re not much more than email drones. “The office is in inverted commas now, because it’s what you make it,” says Julian Cheek, a director at architectural firm <a href=\"http://www.chapmantaylor.com/en/insights/article/the-workplace-of-the-future/en/\">Chapman Taylor</a> and expert in workplace design. “I can contact whoever I want from anywhere, and find out whatever I need. I can have my office in the coffee shop.” So why the building boom?</p> \n<p>It’s not a coincidence that the growth is in London, and mostly in the City: whereas high-end knowledge workers are sufficiently sought-after that they can take a job in the capital at the employer with the most avant-garde selection of amenities, the rest of us will have to make do with the prosaic benefits of a more efficient approach to hotdesking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0eaefbf22954de85455553ee8a6b20570fae1636\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432652515446/3892d4f5-7e22-4d87-ab43-35201e0bad14-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Google's Mountain View complex has a number of play areas with table tennis, video games and table football.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google’s Mountain View complex has a number of play areas with table tennis, video games and table football.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Winni Wintermeyer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“You do see private equity firms with 10 people in 5,000 sq ft,” says Tim Robinson. “They have to have the table football and the snooker. They employ people on big salaries with big bonuses who want to be able to boast about it.” For everyone else, he says, it’s more a question of consolidating dispersed offices and cutting down on wasteful space for each worker. “We don’t have any of those facilities in our office,” Robinson adds. “If we ended up with six table tennis tables, it wouldn’t work culturally. You’d have the senior partner wondering why people weren’t working.”</p> \n<p>Saval asks what’s going on outside of metropolises. “[That culture is] in cities such as New York or London, not Cleveland or the rest of the UK. In those places you have a preponderance of empty buildings. You’ve had these waves of office development throughout history, and they always represent speculation. Unless capitalism has solved some of its problems in ways that I’m unaware of, it’s likely to follow the same pattern again. It will come to seem absurd.”</p> \n<p>There are, of course, stories about less august businesses trying to take a page from the Google playbook, but <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2014/04/30/take-down-that-slide-why-wacky-office-spaces-dont-always-work-4712558/\">by and large they do seem to be a bit daft</a>. How many times can you go down a slide at work, after all, before you start to yearn for the lift? “They attempt these things because they see the accoutrements as the creative things about those workplaces,” says Saval. “But that’s not really what’s innovative. You can’t replicate Silicon Valley by replicating the trappings.” This approach can reach a comical pitch. Cheek knows of one media company, determined to imprint its left-of-centre credentials, that made everything in the office red. “Well, it’s fine, but it’s very fleeting,” he says bemusedly. “What do you do with the Tories in [power]?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"08cefc410cb00dc81dd10bfddae0a2ca6e576e82\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432652857484/cc8d5d1b-1d8a-48ae-8208-3d4a6e67709e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A food station at Google's Washington reception.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A food station at Google’s Washington reception.

The office, suggests Cheek, could become a meeting place and a branding opportunity, and not much more. “You still need that presence but, ultimately, that could be a shoebox.” What’s more, he predicts, the more faddish aspects of the environment that led Oxendine to live in his car will quickly fall out of fashion in the face of cold, hard financial reality. “I think you’ll hit a bubble where it is not efficient to create 20 sq metres per person,” he says. “We’ll hit a new balance between what’s realistic and what’s affordable.” That likelihood only seems to grow when you consider the difficulty of conducting thorough research on the subject. It’s easy to show that free food makes people happier; it’s harder to show that it makes them more productive, or that it has more of an impact than a chunky bonus.</p> \n<p>If you’re getting ready to hand in your security pass, though, you may want to hang on to it for a while yet. Whatever changes have been wrought in the workplace over the years, one factor has proven decidedly irritatingly intractable: the workers themselves. Consider <a href=\"http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/7.02/chiat_pr.html\">Chiat\\Day</a>, an innovative US ad agency that made an early attempt at hotdesking in 1993 – only to find that managers would send their assistants in before dawn to bag the best desks, and to endure the spectacle of one staffer doggedly wheeling his documents around in a little red wagon. The experiment didn’t last long.

Still a spry and self-sufficient figure, his centenary has been marked by publication of a study of 14 eminent cases in which he was briefed for the defence. Space limitations have excluded several fascinating cases: Hutchinson defended the Great Train Robber Charlie Wilson, the corrupt Labour leader of<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/northeast/series2/tdansmith_newcastlepolitics.shtml\"> Newcastle council, T Dan Smith</a>, and won in the court of appeal on behalf of Commander Christopher Swabey, after a 16-year fight against conviction by a Royal Navy court martial for indecent assault (Swabey had supposedly put his hand on a sub-lieutenant’s knee).</p> \n<p>Hutchinson is a scion of the Bloomsbury set (his mother was a Strachey, who became a model for Virginia Woolf’s character Clarissa Dalloway as well as the lover of Clive Bell). He remembers both TS Eliot and John Maynard Keynes before they became the celebrity authors of <em>The Waste Land</em> and <em>The Economic Consequences of the Peace</em>. For much of the war he was a naval officer on ships commanded by Louis Mountbatten, and he was swept overboard when German dive-bombers sank the destroyer HMS Kelly. Mountbatten made the survivors sing “Roll out the Barrel” to lift their spirits.</p> \n<p>At the 1945 general election Hutchinson stood unsuccessfully as the Labour candidate in a now defunct constituency covering Whitehall and Soho. His sale of an inherited Monet snow scene financed his early years as a young barrister married to the great actor Peggy Ashcroft.</p> \n<p>Among other minor cases he secured the acquittal of the boozy actor Trevor Howard on a drink-driving charge, by showing that Howard had had a long discussion with an arresting officer about the differences between a googly and a leg break: “Is it really likely, members of the jury, that a man could have such a conversation and yet be incapable of having proper control of a car?” Hutchinson asked. As the result of such acquittals, Hutchinson was described by Arnold Goodman, the showbiz solicitor and political Mr Fixit, as “the most brilliant criminal counsel of our day”.</p> \n<p>Hutchinson’s career-changing case was the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2010/oct/22/dh-lawrence-lady-chatterley-trial\">prosecution in 1960 of Penguin Books </a>for publishing a cheap, accessible, paperback edition of <em>Lady Chatterley’s Lover</em>. His cross-examination of Richard Hoggart proved the turning-point of the case (the judge’s wife, who sat beside him throughout the trial, arms crossed across her virtuous chest, glared at the court as salacious details were discussed). Penguin’s acquittal has been often described, but Thomas Grant retells the story from Hutchinson’s standpoint with undiminished piquancy.</p> \n<p>In the 1960s Hutchinson defended <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2009/aug/04/george-blake-confession-review\">George Blake</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2001/apr/10/past.derekbrown\">John Vassall</a>, who were both convicted of spying for Soviet Russia, as well as the atomic scientist Giuseppe Martelli, who was acquitted. Blake was an MI6 officer who been held in captivity in North Korea in 1950-53, survived a “death march”, had a semi-religious conversion to communism and spied for the Russians in Berlin and Beirut. The account of Blake’s trial by Grant and Hutchinson is more nuanced, credible and informative than those of the usual espionage historians. The prosecution’s conduct was unscrupulous, the judge was nobbled with allegations that were not made in court, and both the misconduct of the trial and the sentence of 42 years were beyond doubt discreditable.</p> \n<p>By common consent Hutchinson made one of the great postwar defence speeches during the trial for perjury of Christine Keeler in 1963. Both Grant and Hutchinson fault the account of this speech that I gave in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/jan/04/an-english-affair-richard-davenport-hines-review\">my history of the Profumo affair</a>: they convince me that I oversimplified my summary of Hutchinson’s masterful address to the jury, and that I did him a careless injustice.</p> \n<p>Prudery is one sub-theme of this excellent book. Heterosexual anal sex was punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment until 1994 (prosecuting counsel said of the scene where DH Lawrence’s gamekeeper buggers Constance Chatterley that it was “not very easy … to know what in fact he is driving at”). Grant has a splendid chapter on the prosecution for obscenity in 1969 of the publisher of Paul Ableman’s historical and psychological treatise <em>The Mouth and Oral Sex</em> – written, says Grant, with the “ingenuous and artless delight” of a butterfly collector for his subject. This was at a time when a stipendiary magistrate remarked in court, when counsel informed him that oral sex was widely practised, “If that is really so, then I am glad that I do not have long to live.” Mr Justice King-Hamilton, trying <em>The Mouth</em> case, asked Margaret Drabble, one of the defence witnesses, why anyone needed to read about oral sex in 1969. “We have managed to get on for a couple of thousand years without it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3270029b1b591d1cdb49a4e599edc3bf349ef45\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432658193699/c4c3b922-252a-417d-8e7e-a9c974030095-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A scene from Howard Brenton's play 'The Romans In Britain', at the National Theatre, London, in 1980.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Howard Brenton’s play ‘The Romans In Britain’, at the National Theatre, London, in 1980.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hutchinson was briefed for the defence when in 1982 the public moralist Mary Whitehouse brought a private prosecution under the Sexual Offences Act against the director of the National Theatre’s production of Howard Brenton’s play <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/mar/19/romans-in-britain-play-mary-whitehouse-trial-archive-1982\"><em>The Romans in Britain</em></a>. It was claimed that the director had “procured” an act of “gross indecency” between two actors who played a scene in which a Roman soldier buggered a Celtic druid. A witness who had been sitting in the upper circle claimed to have seen an erect penis, but Hutchinson, in a scene of dramatic hilarity, showed in court that the actor had been wriggling his thumb.</p> \n<p>While defending Duncan Campbell in the GCHQ secrets trial of 1978, Hutchinson obtained the first public admission that jury-vetting took place. His other official secrets trials include those of six nuclear disarmament campaigners in 1962, and the politically inspired attempt in 1971 to convict a military adviser, the editor of the Sunday Telegraph and the future MP Jonathan Aitken for leaking an official report at the time of the Biafra civil war in Nigeria.</p> \n<p>Grant recounts these trials in limpid prose which clarifies obscurities. A delicious flavouring of cool irony, which is so much more effective than hot indignation, covers his treatment of the small-mindedness and cheapness behind some prosecutions.</p> \n<p>The pungency, intelligence and humour of Grant and his subject make this the most enlivening of case-books. It ends with a postscript by Hutchinson. He is scathing about Tony Blair as prime minister “supporting his autocratic and oppressive home secretary, David Blunkett” in dethroning lord chancellors as heads of the judiciary, and thus freeing the way for Chris Grayling to wreak havoc as minister for justice (Grayling is one of the few men whom Hutchinson appears to despise).</p> \n<p>In his postscript, and throughout Grant’s account, Hutchinson is portrayed as an anti-establishment crusader. This is either an affectation or based on a very limited definition of the great and good. Actually, he is a quintessential establishment figure – unshakeably self-confident, paternalistic, disinterested and altruistic. Jacob Rothschild, the financier, is his nephew and Lord Ribblesdale – the subject of <a href=\"http://www.wikiart.org/en/john-singer-sargent/lord-ribblesdale-1902#supersized-artistPaintings-265885\">John Singer Sargent’s haughty portrait <em>The Ancestor</em></a> – was his second wife’s grandfather. His contacts, and his masterly discretion in using them, make him an arch-establishment figure, and prove what good work such men and women can achieve.</p> \n<p>A long-serving trustee and chairman of the Tate gallery, it was he who prompted the Clore Foundation to fund the Turner annexe there. He took the labouring oar in starting Tate Liverpool and succeeded in making an insular institution more European in its reach. He received a life peerage from a Labour government in 1978, but has had the self-effacing sense to removed himself from the House of Lords in old age (he was the first peer to resign membership of the House). As this book shows, he is abundant in the qualities of empathy, consideration and humour. He manages to be both charming and shatteringly truthful, without a jot of male vanity.</p> \n<p><em>Jeremy Hutchinson’s Case Histories</em>, with its examples of police perjury, political manipulation and judicial failings, should rally those enlightened Conservatives who have misgivings about British withdrawal from the European court of human rights and mistrust similar ill-judged law-and-order sops to potential Ukip voters. This book makes a compelling read, and is a real contribution to the history of 20th-century English mentalities. It is also a first-rate lesson in simple humanity.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Richard Davenport-Hines’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/universal-man.html\"><em>Universal Man:</em></a><em> The Seven Lives of John Maynard Keynes</em> is published by William Collins.

Croydon has such a poor reputation that its name has become a neologism for the self-destruction of a town centre – Croydonisation. The town’s inhabitants can exhibit a lowliness bordering on self-loathing. “It could have been worse,” says <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/bob-stanley\">Bob Stanley</a>, whose <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/saint-etienne\">band Saint Etienne</a> was formed in Croydon. “In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/normans/doomsday_01.shtml\">the Domesday Book</a> it was called Crogdene.

He’s one of three former Croydonians who are challenging conceptions of their hometown with <a href=\"http://www.roughtrade.com/events/2015/5/1198\">Croydon Till I Die, a reading event</a> that celebrates the music, literature and architecture of the suburbs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>'In the Domesday Book it was called Crogdene. Imagine if it was still called that?'</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It has been organised at Rough Trade East and <a href=\"https://www.fairfield.co.uk/en-GB/shows/croydon%20till%20i%20die/info\">Croydon’s Fairfield Halls</a> by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/may/09/year-reading-dangerously-books-saved-life-review\">Andy Miller, whose memoir The Year of Reading Dangerously</a> found him fondly recalling his formative years in Croydon’s libraries, and wondering why the suburbs rarely featured in the books he read. “I was never embarrassed to come from Croydon, until people told me I should be,” says Miller. “Then I thought, ‘Why the hell should I be?’ It feels like people are allowed to feel proud of where they come from, [as long as that’s] anywhere <em>other</em> than a particular kind of metropolitan suburb. Society needs a suburban joke and Croydon fits the bill.”</p> \n<p>Croydon may have often been seen as boring and narrow-minded, but it received additional disdain for its inhospitable appearance, which inspired John Grindrod, the event’s third participant, to write <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/jan/09/concretopia-john-grindrod-review\">Concretopia</a>, an examination of Britain’s postwar brutalist reconstruction. In the 1960s, skyscrapers were banned from central London and Croydon stepped in, building 49 thunderous tower blocks. “It was an ultra-capitalist version of what a town should be,” says Grindrod, who grew up on the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/davehillblog/2014/may/15/london-borough-elections-2014-croydon\">estate of New Addington</a>. “It was all about how many big companies they could attract. The impulse was heroic, but not in an edifying way.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5226617b354e53c8c1ece157804fe73a20662a44\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432301615886/e8b3ba68-74d2-49c1-9970-d946224a423e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Croydon Flyover was part of a devastating redevelopment that flattened entire streets.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Croydon Flyover was part of a devastating redevelopment that flattened entire streets.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA Archive</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This redevelopment was devastating. It drove a flyover through the town and flattened entire streets. Watching it happen was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2001/feb/28/artsfeatures.sexpistols\">Jamie Reid</a>, then studying with Malcolm McLaren at Croydon School of Art, where Reid developed the <a href=\"http://www.opus-art.com/the-artists/artist/jamie-reid\">Situationist-inspired collages he later used with the Sex Pistols</a>. In 1972, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mwp6ab7s5-Q\">Reid’s publishing outfit, Suburban Press</a>, pictured desolate Croydon with the headline, “<a href=\"http://2hamagazine.tumblr.com/post/100611900641/lo-a-monster-is-born-suburban-press-by-jamie\">Lo! A Monster Is Born</a>”. The experience was encapsulated by the opening titles of Terry and June, a popular 1970s sitcom, which saw the suburban couple wandering around Croydon in a state of dislocated confusion. Things worsened as Croydon lost out to the City and Canary Wharf as a business centre. Croydon’s unfulfilled ambition became something else to mock. “When a council can redevelop a whole town like that, it’s going to knock your confidence,” says Stanley.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed element--supporting\" data-alt=\"Terry and June opening titles\"> \n <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihA0ah-JJZE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But others embraced Croydon. Stanley always thought the town felt “optimistic”, while Grindrod says: “It was amazingly futuristic. It was so dramatic to arrive in a town on an urban motorway surrounded by towers and huge shopping centres.”</p> \n<p>Culturally, Croydon has plenty to shout about. The town played a formative role in punk, thanks to McLaren, Reid and The Damned, and <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/dubstep-straight-outta-croydon-409487.html\">would later spawn dubstep</a>. The film director <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2008/may/04/features\">David Lean</a> was from Croydon, as was actor <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Ashcroft\">Peggy Ashcroft</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/sep/30/kirsty-maccoll-birthday-album-reissue\">singer-songwriter Kirsty MacColl</a>. Author <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/neilgaiman\">Neil Gaiman</a> went to school there, and his Croydon-set short story How to Talk to Girls at Parties (about “the most dangerous place in the universe”) <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/13/nicole-kidman-eyes-john-cameron-mitchells-how-to-talk-to-girls-at-parties\">will soon be made into a film</a>. “Suburbs like Croydon are where so many interesting things, certainly in pop culture, take place,” says Miller. The dislocation and anger of punk and dubstep partly reflect Croydon’s alienating landscape. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2001/apr/08/alternativeinvestments.personalfinancenews\">Judge Dredd co-creator Carlos Ezquerra</a> lived in Croydon during the 1970s; one wonders how much the city inspired the <a href=\"http://judgedredd.wikia.com/wiki/Mega-City_One\">feuding tower blocks and deadly subways of Mega-City One</a>. </p> \n<p>Croydon also provided opportunities for cultural exploration. Fairfield Halls, built in 1962 as a smaller version of Royal Festival Hall, brought bands like <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/kraftwerk\">Kraftwerk</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/dec/11/t-rex-the-complete-studio-albums-review\">T-Rex </a>and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/pinkfloyd\">Pink Floyd</a> to the suburbs, until the provincial circuit went into decline. “In the 70s, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparks_%28band%29\">it hosted Sparks</a> and Kraftwerk, and by the 90s it was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basil_Brush\">Basil Brush,</a>” says Stanley. “You can trace the cultural decline of Croydon in the headline acts of Fairfield Halls.”</p> \n<p>For Stanley, pop culture hinged around<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6214278.stm\"> Beano’s, the biggest secondhand record shop</a> in England until its closure in 2009. There, he pursued musical interests that led him to form Saint Etienne with Pete Wiggs. The band were proud Croydonians, but they were almost alone in that. “When you think about musicians from Croydon, it’s hard to get past <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain_Sensible\">Captain Sensible</a>,” says Stanley. “Nobody else admits they came from here because it’s so uncool.”</p> \n<p>Croydon came to be seen as a place where nothing happened, and little was done to challenge this perception. In 2011, <a href=\"http://www.timothygodfrey.net/2011/01/croydon-conservative-council-still.html\">the Conservative council slashed the arts budget</a>, flogging ceramics from a local museum, closing the arthouse David Lean Cinema (which they ran, and <a href=\"http://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2014/02/beloved-croydon-cinema-set-for-march-reopening/\">is only alive again thanks to a campaign by volunteers</a>) and scrapping a local music festival. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"414e9032f3253b740a8d6165aa3dcdfdbab0aae7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432301243155/19478ba4-a880-420d-8144-e8b449e74765-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Aerial photograph of the devastation of Croydon town centre during the 2011 riot.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parts of Croydon town centre were devastated by the 2011 riots.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/David Goddard</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Croydon was then hit by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/uk/london-riots\">the riots of August 2011</a>: shops burned and one man was killed. Months later, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-19685319\">Allders department store closed</a>, and the town’s major employer, <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/bitter-blow-for-croydon-as-nestl-decamps-to-crawley-7304742.html\">Nestl&eacute;, moved to Crawley</a>, leaving huge empty towers. This was the town’s nadir. “So much is undeveloped,” says Miller. “It’s urban deprivation in the suburbs.”</p> \n<p>Things are slowly changing. As well as a new Labour council that has reinvested in the arts, there is a <a href=\"https://www.croydon.gov.uk/planningandregeneration/regeneration/regentimeline\">huge &pound;5.25bn redevelopment plan</a>. Jo Negrini, the council’s executive director of redevelopment, jokingly said <a href=\"http://www.croydonadvertiser.co.uk/Borough-s-new-economy-chief-sets-vision/story-21298672-detail/story.html\">“third time lucky”</a> in reference to previous failed masterplans – but insisted that this time the regeneration is for real. Around 30 blocks are being built or converted, as the council attempts to transform redundant offices into high-value residential properties and attract new firms: 170 start-ups are set to occupy one tower called Tech City. And there’s a new <a href=\"https://www.croydon.gov.uk/planningandregeneration/regeneration/westfield-hammerson/whitgift\">shopping centre from Westfield and Hammerson</a> to replace the ageing Whitgift Centre. “It’s a real indicator of the market,” says Negrini. “People are saying if Westfield will invest, there must be something going on.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a18a3a00b9628251fe62452cd73e7de553f1fd93\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432653984457/5e7051fc-8c04-4963-8a5c-317eb860f7d8-460x423.jpeg\" alt=\"Pete Wiggs, Sarah Cracknell and Bob Stanley of St Etienne.\" width=\"460\" height=\"423\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pete Wiggs, Sarah Cracknell and Bob Stanley of St Etienne.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The eye-watering &pound;5.25bn figure is <a href=\"http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/daily-news/all-systems-go-for-croydon-as-long-awaited-retail-redevelopment-gets-go-ahead/8642709.article\">the combined cost of private investment and public spending</a>: some money is coming from the <a href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/regeneration/high-streets/projects/croydon-town-centre\">Mayor’s Regeneration Fund</a>, some from the council itself, and some from corporations, including the &pound;1.5bn that Westfield is pouring into the enormous shopping centre. The council wants to partly cover its costs by getting devolved powers that would let it raise local taxes on new developments – something that <a href=\"http://croydonbid.com/news/council-bids-devolution-powers\">has yet to happen</a>.</p> \n<p>Joanna Rowelle is associate director of Arup, one of several firms involved in the redevelopment. She likens Croydon to Stratford before the Olympics. “London is growing, so we are looking for places that look like a good opportunity, and Croydon is well located for that,” she says. It’s on a trainline linking the tech clusters of Brighton and Farringdon, she notes, and will also likely benefit from the gentrification of London, which is forcing the middle classes back into the suburbs they thought they had escaped. </p> \n<p>Local residents, like Sarah Wickens, are watching and waiting. “The snobbery really annoys me,” she says. “But it’s true that the town really doesn’t make the most of itself.” Wickens is one of several locals hoping to stimulate Croydon’s cultural scene: she co-organised <a href=\"http://croydonfunpalace.org/\">Croydon Fun Palace, an alternative arts and science fair</a> in October 2014. Other new cultural initiatives in Croydon include an <a href=\"http://matthewsyard.com/\">arts space in Matthews Yard</a>, featuring a gallery and theatre, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RISEgalleryuk\">Rise Gallery</a>, which has brought contemporary art to the bedraggled St George’s Walk shopping centre. </p> \n<p>Even New Addington, the troubled estate outside of Croydon, is getting some much-needed attention. When Grindrod lived there, it was the sort of place the other Croydonians looked down on. “It felt like it was miles from anywhere, up on this hill,” he says. “You could take the 130 bus to Croydon and it took an hour. It’s only later I realised it was in zone five.” Now, New Addington has benefited from the attention of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/may/12/assemble-turner-prize-2015-wildcard-how-the-young-architecture-crew-assemble-rocked-the-art-world\">Turner prize-dominated architecture collective Assemble</a>. Funded by the post-riot <a href=\"http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/regeneration/high-streets/funding-programmes/outer-london-fund\">Outer London Fund</a>, Assemble were appointed designers-in-residence and got to work in the market square: a concrete space they animated with a tea dance, parade, sessions and cake decorating that involved all spheres of the community. They then made physical changes – a stage, skateboard ramps, new positions for market traders – which have been widely praised and achieved a nomination for the New London Architecture’s 2013 award for best public space.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"28508c020dab3095d84550342c4eeccb3952eedd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432302058535/d1dfa61c-dd31-4b55-b6b0-d6bdc4b26a7a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The proposed skyline of Croydon following the &pound;5.25bn redevelopment.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The proposed skyline of Croydon following the &pound;5.25bn redevelopment.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Croydon Council</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It’s a slow process,” says Wickens. “There are exciting things happening, but it just doesn’t feel like it’s quite coming together after the cuts. There are also questions about the role of developers, which will be huge in the next few years.” In particular, she worries the demolition of the Whitgift Centre is the beginning of the end for Croydon’s divisive but eye-catching concrete townscape – which gives the town both its awkward reputation and its aura of uniqueness. </p> \n<p>On this, Negrini is reassuring. “There are some great examples of 60s architecture – and there’s some crap stuff. There are treasures we want to maintain, like<a href=\"https://p10.secure.hostingprod.com/@spyblog.org.uk/ssl/london_cyberpunk_tourist_guide/2009/10/croydon-lunar-house-and-apollo-house---uk-border-agency.html\"> Lunar House and Apollo House</a> [both by <a href=\"http://www.building.co.uk/the-notorious-work-of-richard-seifert/5027597.article\">Centre Point architect Richard Seifert</a>]. We don’t want to bulldoze everything like we did in the 60s – we want to embrace the legacy of this place. We’ve already done that with the conservation area of the old town, but the 60s stuff is just important.” The council is also organising a music festival and refurbishing Fairfield Halls. “There is a real issue of public perception of Croydon,” she says. “We are very keen on changing those perceptions, and culture has a big impact on regeneration.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"690035fcf8e3a6c3e4477b7a8e9edd280bb5c4cf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432301492000/35f78e67-0a9d-4211-b2ad-bc0d7a0406cd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lunar House, an example of Croydon's 1960s architecture.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lunar House, an example of Croydon’s 1960s architecture.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Turning Croydon into a place that David Bowie can talk about without sniggering will be difficult. Stanley hopes that, whatever happens, Croydon’s strange spirit will survive. “It’s a typical suburb, but it’s also like nowhere else I know – Terry and June and Jamie Reid at the same time,” he says. “It’s that mix that’s so fascinating.” </p> \n<p>But not fascinating enough for him to live there. Despite their affection for the town, neither Stanley, Grindrod or Miller are residents, though Miller insists he remains one in spirit. “I’m like the Sean Connery of Croydon – I don’t live there any more, but I am fiercely proud of it. What I want to tell people at Rough Trade East is: do you know what Croydon is? It’s where you came from before you went to events like this.

Mallory meets at Charterhouse “an ancient amour of mine ... a young man of 17 but still only just past the moment of puberty &amp; with a fair skin &amp; fair curly hair &amp; red enticing lips! What will happen? His mother wrote me a confiding letter asking me to take care of him”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b4e0dfa36be2db82f41b29935bfd9d7d93c0db8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432682756665/8324929c-1803-467c-81b6-08c07bdc967c-460x344.jpeg\" alt=\"George Mallory letters to be auctioned at Bonhams in June.\" width=\"460\" height=\"344\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Mallory letters to be auctioned at Bonhams in June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>However, Matthew Haley, head of books and manuscripts at Bonhams, thinks Mallory is sometimes just being whimsical to amuse Strachey. He writes “I have an odd prejudice against climbing in dress clothes”, and in another letter imagines himself in the future: “I, in about 1930, have stood my trial for sodomy in defence of my conduct and am playing altogether a very heroic part.”</p> \n<p>Strachey was knocked for six by Mallory on sight. “Mon Dieu! George Mallory!”, he wrote to Vanessa Bell, Virgina Woolf’s sister, (in a previously published letter, not in the sale) after their first meeting. “My hand trembles, my heart palpitates ... he’s six foot high, with the body of an athlete by Praxiteles and a face – oh incredible – the mystery of Botticelli, the refinement and delicacy of a Chinese print ...”<br /></p> \n<p>Mallory was then 23, and Strachey 29. Mallory may have been delicately rebuffing him when he wrote: “I myself have found that it is the young always whom I desire (I believe this to have been your experience also).”</p> \n<p>“Mallory was so gorgeous, and Strachey perhaps not to everyone’s taste,” Haley said, “but I should imagine Mallory was flattered by such admiration wherever it came from.” <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3cfe955c8a4a3e18c80f06c118eb045829fb07e3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432682615969/1a55a459-6e43-4a34-a3a3-0ad0bf25e09e-284x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Lytton Strachey confided to Vanessa Bell his thoughts of George Mallory: ‘He’s six foot high, with the body of an athlete by Praxiteles and a face ... the mystery of Botticelli, the refinement and delicacy of a Chinese print ...’\" width=\"284\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lytton Strachey confided to Vanessa Bell his thoughts of George Mallory: ‘He’s six foot high, with the body of an athlete by Praxiteles and a face ... the mystery of Botticelli, the refinement and delicacy of a Chinese print ...’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>He does not believe there was ever a physical relationship between them. “The very camp tone is quite typical of letters of the period from these Cambridge circles, where after all there were no women in those days, and there were a lot of them dabbling around in this kind of thing. Things often changed when they left and met some real women.”</p> \n<p>The poet Rupert Brooke, regarded by many men and women as the most beautiful human being of his generation, did not attract Mallory. He wrote: “I have I believe after much perplexity discovered what you mean by using the word flirtatious: but I am not in the least interest in that quarter, &amp; should be the last to discourage any attempt upon him.”</p> \n<p>In 1909, he wrote from France commiserating over the grim weather in Cambridge, but suggested the city had many consolations. “You may perhaps find some compensation for living in Cambridge in the excellent opportunities it affords for a strenuous intellectual life; it is a great advantage too that there should be so many young men from who to choose suitable and worthy companions.”</p> \n<p>In 1914, he wrote to Strachey of his impending marriage to Ruth Turner, a happy union which would produce two daughters and a son.</p> \n<p>“It can hardly be a shock to you that I desert the ranks of the fashionable homosexualists (and yet I am still in part of that persuasion) unless you think I have turned monogamist. But you may be assured that this last catastrophe has not happened. </p> \n<p>“This sentiment shocks me deeply – considering that I really am to be tied by the conjugal knot &amp; actually to be blessed by the Church of England: but then the truth always is so shocking and probably nobody is monogamous.”</p> \n<p>That letter ends “yr. affect George Mallory” with an invitation to dinner, but although letters continued into the 1920s, after his marriage they became more widely spaced, and the friendship was evidently cooling. The last ended “A letter will pursue me to Tibet if you address it Mount Everest expedition c/o Postmaster Darjeeling. Please give my love to Duncan [Grant] when you see him. Yrs. ever George Mallory.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f973ded239bff98f625e58c1b481009ad87163eb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432682875138/1f18c1a3-27e9-421b-8e20-584c2b3b5705-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'Probably nobody is monogamous': George Mallory letters to be auctioned at Bonhams in June.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Probably nobody is monogamous’: George Mallory letters to be auctioned at Bonhams in June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> The man who famously replied “because it’s there” to a journalist who asked why he felt driven to conquer Everest, died on his third attempt on the mountain in 1924. </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://video.nationalgeographic.com/video/movies/wildest-dream-finding-body\">His body was found there in 1999</a>.

For all those similarly in need of correction on the subject of the Maid of Orleans, last night was our night.</p> \n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02rx4lc\"><strong>Joan of Arc: God’s Warrior</strong></a><strong> </strong>(BBC2), Dr Helen Castor stripped away the accreted layers of subsequent interpretation, myth and legend to give us the barest, cleanest bones she could of what is, even at its sparest, an astonishing story. Deep in the 100 Years’ War and the Armagnac countryside, a teenage peasant girl hears the voice of God and his angels telling her to cross 250 miles of enemy territory to the Dauphin’s court in Chinon, persuade him to give her an army, use said army to drive the English out of France for ever and have the Dauphin crowned king. Nowadays, she might have expended her passions relatively safely on a few tweets (“OMFG! Cn sum1 tell Dauf am on way 2 end haterz? #Orleanslolz”) and a few Instagram snaps of the visions and their accompanying golden light (#nofilter), but in 1429 the only question that bothered her countrymen and the Dauphin when she got there was – were the voices and the visions sent by God or the devil?</p> \n<p>Fortunately, the chance to raise the seven-month siege of Orleans presented a handy testing ground. If she succeeded, clearly the visions were sent from God – who was known to be an Armagnac – and there would be a full Anglo-Burgundian smiting thereafter. If she failed, then the maid had been tempted, as maids often are, by the devil – and Orleans would remain under siege but no worse off. The Dauphin gave her a bespoke suit of armour, a shining banner and the sword she predicted his soldiers would find at the nearby church of St Catherine, and sent her off to Orleans.</p> \n<p>Despite being the wrong age, sex and class for both warfare and divine-conduiting, the 17-year-old Joan took back the town in four days and had the Dauphin crowned King Charles VII within the month, her growing reputation as God’s chosen warrior smoothing their passage across the country towards Reims cathedral.</p> \n<p>Was he grateful? What’s medieval French for “Was he buggery”? Preferring diplomacy and compromise to the Maid of Orleans’ mission to drive the English out of France, the king abandoned her to her fate when she was captured after failing to liberate Paris. A nicely filleted version of her trial’s transcripts showed the weight of the church and the would-be Burgundian state bearing down on her in the form of Pierre Cauchon, who eventually tied her up in theological knots and delivered her to the pyre. She recanted, was reprieved and then, all but out of her mind, proclaimed her heresy once again and was burned at the stake and on to the collective cultural consciousness forevermore.</p> \n<p>Alongside the facts – as much as they can be known to us – Dr Castor did a wonderful job of explaining how her impossible mission succeeded as far as it did; the credulity of desperate people, the hunger for glory, the unshakeable confidence and the astonishing capacities that follow it if you truly believe you cannot fail. And in the shining banner and the bespoke armour lies, au fond, the power of advertising. If God had any sense, he looked down as she marched towards the foot of Les Tourelles and whispered to one of his minions “Tell them to print the legend.”</p> \n<p>On display over on BBC3, meanwhile, were the unshakeable confidence and astonishing capacity for booze inhering in the modern teenager, in <strong>Festivals, Sex and Suspicious Parents</strong>. If you were lucky enough not to catch the earlier series, the set-up is: a couple of teenagers who make you wish you/they were dead go off to a festival but are secretly spied on at all times by their parents, who make you wish ditto. At the end, the latter confront the former, have a few words, don’t die and you turn to drink yourself. Last night, Amy’s mum, Susan, just hoped “she doesn’t end up in a medical tent this year,” while Charlie’s mum, Donna, was secure in the knowledge that her perfect son wouldn’t put a foot wrong. Need I bother telling you how it all unfolded? No, I thought not. “He doesn’t smoke,” said Donna. She watched footage of him smoking. “I don’t think he smokes,” she repeated firmly. By the end he’d all but broken her heart but she kept smiling. An act of faith. I shall keep hoping for some smiting in episodes to come.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432650911422/2ff70eb9-bb94-4eb4-b08d-c2e97c97a288-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Gibbions/BBC/Matchlight/Chris Gibbions","altText":"Dr Helen Castor presents Joan of Arc: God's Warrior.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chris Gibbions/BBC/Matchlight/Chris Gibbions"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-27T06:00:30Z","lastModified":"2015-05-27T06:38:20Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":69,"contributors":[{"name":"Lucy Mangan","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733743116/LucyMangan.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/lucymangan"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Television","Television & radio","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Lucy Mangan","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/lucymangan"}}],"series":{"title":"Last night's TV","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/series/lastnightstv"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"tv-and-radio"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/may/27/joan-of-arc-gods-warrior-review","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/498g8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/tv-and-radio/2015/may/27/joan-of-arc-gods-warrior-review","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/27/joan-of-arc-gods-warrior-review"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432650911422/2ff70eb9-bb94-4eb4-b08d-c2e97c97a288-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dr Helen Castor presents Joan of Arc: God’s Warrior.
