Anyway, a much better movie would have been one about the <em>actual</em> modern guy who built an ark just like Noah in the Netherlands – which is actually a country prone to flooding. Johan Huibers was inspired to build an ark in 1992, when he had a dream about a great flood. In 2007, he opened a smaller model (still, 70m long is not to be scoffed at), before setting to work on one made to Noah’s (reputed) original dimensions: 30m wide, 23m high and 135m long. This opened to the public in 2012 and contains exhibitions about Noah, as well as being home to a range of animals, including rabbits, horses and kangaroos.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Adults €12.50, kids €7.50,<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.arcofnoah.org/\">arcofnoah.org</a></em></p> \n<h2>Dr Evermor’s Forevertron, Sumpter, Wisconsin, US</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d60775b116bc932b2537bbc4daf81bf48d38f8a0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432743602867/3832f7de-eb2b-408a-ad0e-95c5324bc1d3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dr Evermore near Baraboo, Wisconsin creates recycled metal sculptures.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Tom Every, AKA Dr Evermor, is a former industrial wrecker from Wisconsin who has been building fantastical creations out of scrap metal since 1983.

This is where the Forevertron comes in: the 300-tonne sculpture features a glass capsule for Dr Evermor to perch in when he eventually transports himself back to space. As well as the Forevertron, there are other contraptions to explore: the Graviton and the Celestial Listening Ears, for example, with remnants from industrial-age factories and power plants among the works of art.

Not the luckiest man, Leedskalnin left for the US after being jilted by his 16-year-old fiancee. He contracted TB on his arrival but managed to recover and begin constructing a castle from blocks of limestone coral. He spent 28 years building it until his death in 1951, declaring his “sweet sixteen” to be the inspiration. In that time he intricately carved 1,100 tonnes of stone to create furniture, walls and a castle tower. One of the most impressive feats of engineering was an 8ft, 8-tonne, revolving stone gate balanced on an axis so perfectly that it could be moved with one finger. The mysterious project inspired Billy Idol to record his song, Sweet Sixteen, as a tribute to the castle. <br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Adults $15, kids $7, <a href=\"http://coralcastle.com/\">coralcastle.com</a></em></p> \n<h2>The Crazy House, Dalat, Vietnam</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"186325ab8883a5da3c251ecc4a5e269d0cd928fe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432743749172/4ec86566-da3f-4f01-85c5-6711d7491bb4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Crazy House Hotel, Hang Nga Guesthouse, Dalat, Central Highlands, Vietnam\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Resembling a cheese grater that’s melted, the Crazy House is a fantastic construction that its website describes as “Gaudi-meets-Sesame Street”.

Basically, it will survive pretty much anything, including swimming.</p> \n<p>The 1.25in screen is a new type of always-on, colour <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_paper\">e-paper</a> display. Like e-ink displays on Kindles and other e-readers, it can be read easily in direct light, but also has a backlight activated by movement or a button should you need to read the watch in the dark.</p> \n<p>Unlike the previous Pebbles, the screen can handle smooth animations and while it doesn’t look as slick or as brilliant as the LCD or OLED screens used on other smartwatches, it is on all the time and doesn’t kill the battery.</p> \n<p>I was very impressed by just how far the e-paper technology has come. It is a big step forward over the previous black-and-white Pebble smartwatches.</p> \n<h2>Pairing it</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6a889632e2ac7ec3c3b04ea8a2d2e3e9435ddee\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432741543167/e586dbaf-a174-4aa5-9525-9c912177a86e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pebble Time review\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The pairing and setup process takes a couple of minutes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Pebble connects to an iPhone via Bluetooth, needing the Pebble iOS app to make things work.<br /></p> \n<p>The app controls settings, guiding users through the connection process – including asking permission to access location, notifications and calendar information.</p> \n<p>Pairing is simple – just turn on Bluetooth on the iPhone, access the app and select the Pebble.

The Time takes a simple, effective approach to notifications – anything that has been allowed to show you a notification on the iPhone is sent to the watch.</p> \n<p>The watch vibrates and displays each notification as it comes in, displaying a small snippet of emails, texts, tweets and other alerts. The last notification stays on screen until it is dismissed, which takes two taps of the central button.</p> \n<p>All currently pending notifications can be seen in a list through the notification menu option, and dismissed en-masse, although dismissing a notification on the Pebble does not dismiss it from the iPhone.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://instagram.com/p/3MYiNlJMKe\"> \n <video src=\"http://scontent.cdninstagram.com/hphotos-xaf1/t50.2886-16/11372908_481686791981861_1604781953_n.mp4\" width=\"460\" height=\"428\" type=\"video/mp4\" controls=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></video> \n <figcaption>\n  Music controls display album art, adjust the volume, skip tracks and pause and play.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Beyond notifications, music controls are <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/04/who-are-smartwatches-like-the-apple-watch-really-for\">key reason to own</a> a smartwatch.

Highlights include Misfit and Up for health and fitness monitoring, including sleep tracking, Runkeeper and Runtastic for tracking runs, Evernote, some transport and train times apps, Foursquare’s Swarm, internet of things apps such as Leaf, which is used to controll a Nest thermostat – the list is long.<br /></p> \n<p>Many of these apps are made by hobbiests and are clean, simple and free. When needed, some have companion apps on the phone – and all of them are available through the Pebble app on the smartphone.</p> \n<p>There are an equal number of watchfaces to choose from too. Many of them have added functionality beyond telling the time, including showing the weather, fitness tracking, and the status of IoT devices. There’s pretty much a watchface for anything you want to do.</p> \n<p>I haven’t found many that I find aesthetically pleasing, but that is likely to change now that the colour e-paper screen allows for more creative uses over the old e-ink screens on the original Pebble.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b8a39aba887b5758fe7e551a90f4f5f86a55bae\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432742218577/c7fab908-5c99-425a-8968-c016ab69b489-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pebble Time review\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There are a wealth of watchfaces available for free in the Pebble store, which is worth browsing through to try and find one to fit your personal style.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Battery life and charging</h2> \n<p>Most smartwatches rarely last more than a day, with the exceptions being the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/nov/28/sony-smartwatch-3-review-screen-battery-android-wear\">Sony Smartwatch 3</a>, which lasted three days in my testing. The Pebble lasts much longer.</p> \n<p>Even with heavy use, with hundreds of notifications, sleep tracking and lots of prodding and playing, the Time lasted 72 hours on a single charge.</p> \n<p>Without wearing it overnight that’s around five working days, and likely much longer if you’re not using it constantly .</p> \n<p>Once the battery drops below 5%, it switches to a basic, time-only mode and lasted for about a day in that state. A full charge took two hours using a magnetic USB charging cable, which is long enough to stretch to a bed-side table.</p> \n<p>The Time’s impact on the battery life of the iPhone 6 Plus it was used with was negligible in my testing. The iPhone’s battery usage monitor said the Pebble Time app consumed just 4% of the battery, compared to Safari 19’s% and the home and lockscreen’s 16%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48fb000171e9f50bcebf8350f76503532186dcd5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432741919761/74569023-20a0-4779-9994-256d97ef10d3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pebble Time review\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The magnetic charging cable attaches to the back of the watch, but isn’t very strong meaning it can be detached quite easily.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Price</h2> \n<p>The Pebble Time is available in black, white and red, costing $199 (&pound;130) – a stainless-steel version will cost more at a later date. For a comparison, the Apple Watch costs &pound;300 and up, while Android Wear watches cost from &pound;100 and up.</p> \n<h2>Verdict</h2> \n<p>The Pebble Time is like the Casio of smartwatches: simple and easy to use, it does a couple of things very well without trying to do everything.</p> \n<p>The battery life is fantastic. The always-on screen is clear and easy to read. Its music controls are excellent and its app ecosystem rich.</p> \n<p>The Time is the best watch available for the iPhone for simply getting notifications with the minimum of fuss while still telling the time, which is what smartwatches were born to do.</p> \n<p>It’s also one of the most discreet smartwatches available – small, with muted styling that goes unnoticed, again, like a Casio. That won’t be for everyone, but having standard straps means it’s easy to customise, and costing $199 won’t break the bank doing so.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b144f8d0a5402b6727e8567eef8731d1ba9ac4f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432742031613/deabc912-fc39-4070-9a37-26f795831d62-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pebble Time review\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Pebble is 9.5mm thick, but is slightly curved to fit comfortably on the wrist.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Pros: </strong>long battery life, always-on screen readable in direct light or in the dark, light, waterproof to 30m, simple to use, great music controls</p> \n <p><strong>Cons:</strong> no way to reply to messages, screen is smaller and doesn’t look as good as some, ties into iOS not as good as Apple Watch</p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>Other reviews</h2> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/dec/11/click-tock-which-is-the-best-smartwatch-this-christmas\">Which was the best smartwatch of 2014?</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/apr/28/apple-watch-review-smartwatch-iphone-taptic-siri\">Apple Watch review: beautiful hardware spoiled by complicated software</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/sep/15/motorola-moto-360-review-smartwatch-poor-battery-life\">Motorola Moto 360 review: beautiful smartwatch spoiled by poor battery life</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/nov/18/smartwatch-review-lgs-g-watch-r-is-chunky-masculine-fast\">LG G Watch R review: chunky, masculine, and fast</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/27/asus-zenwatch-review-a-sophisticated-looking-android-smartwatch\">Asus ZenWatch review: a sophisticated-looking Android smartwatch</a></strong></p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432741387830/abcbaf87-d274-423b-b7f1-93d36a7789db-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian","altText":"Pebble Time review","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432741655526/36bbc69f-6823-4f9f-b971-b4cbbe5f8e8e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Time is quite small and subtle for a smartwatch, with a stainless steel bezel and plastic body, here with an optional leather strap.

Now it’s home to what is surely the world’s most elaborate prison football league – and a model for the transformative power of the beautiful game","byline":"David Goldblatt","body":"<p>15 March, friendly<br /><strong>Ward Two 1 – 1 Ward Seven</strong></p> \n<p>A decade ago, Opio Moses was a lowly policeman out in the sticks of Eastern Uganda with a complicated love life. He had fallen for the wrong woman. One day, her uncle, who was politically connected, came to pay Moses a visit at home. He told Moses at gunpoint that their match was unsuitable and that the relationship was now over. Moses also had a gun. Both men fired at each other. Moses was wounded and the uncle was left dead, shot in the chest. Moses then turned his gun on himself. These days, his greying hair is cropped short and barely conceals the long jagged scar where his own bullet split his scalp and skull.</p> \n<p>Moses was sentenced to 20 years for murder. When he first&nbsp;arrived at Luzira Upper Prison, Uganda’s only maximumsecurity facility on the southern edge of Kampala, he was filled with despair. His days were bleak and purposeless. He was paralysed by remorse and did not know how he would serve out his term. But as the shock began to wear off, he realised Luzira was not like other prisons. The inmates could play football. And the football was not just kickabouts in the yard. There were formal clubs and tournaments, even fans. In 2006, Moses began to play as an accomplished striker with a prison team.</p> \n<p>Now, nine years later, he is the chairman of UPSA, the Upper Prison Sports Association, football’s sovereign body in Luzira. Moses, among his other duties, is also a warder, personally responsible for the care of two dozen psychiatric patients, who are among the most vulnerable inmates in the jail. He shares their ward, organises their medication and generally keeps an eye on them. This is not his toughest duty, however. “Being chairman of UPSA is the most challenging, stressful, disturbing and tiresome work that one can do in the Upper Prison,” he said. His daily duties include finding sponsors, organising tournaments, dealing with disciplinary issues, and running a player registration and transfer system.</p> \n<p>Over the past two decades, Luzira has gone from being a notoriously violent and squalid place, to one of the most progressive prisons in Africa. By any standard, it is a success. It has a recidivism rate of less than 30%, better than its counterparts in the UK, where, according to the Prison Reform Trust, <a href=\" http://www.prisonreformtrust.org.uk/Portals/0/Documents/Prison%20the%20facts%20May%202014.pdf\" title=\"\">46% of former inmates commit crimes on release</a>. Its schools, staffed by the prisoners themselves, put almost every&nbsp;inmate through a programme of education that stretches from basic literacy to the completion of high school and then offers vocational training (tailoring and carpentry) or university degrees in management and law with the local Royal Mutessa University and the University of London. Luzira’s infrastructure is dilapidated, its poverty is harsh but it is a deeply humane environment. The philosophy behind the prison is very simple. “People need to be busy”, the officer-in-charge, Wilson Magomu, told me.</p> \n<p>Upper Prison has kept itself busy with extraordinary ingenuity. The prisoners have created their own drama, they dance, and they play music on homemade instruments. There is prayer and counselling in the church and mosque. But more popular than anything else is football. Within the prison there are 10 football clubs, some of them almost two decades old, each with their own players, boards and constitutions. Alongside Moses’s old team Aston Villa, there is Liverpool and Manchester United, Everton and Chelsea, Arsenal and Newcastle United. There is Barcelona, Juventus and Hannover 96 too, but football in Luzira, like football in all of Uganda, is dominated by the Premier League.</p> \n<p>Since the arrival of satellite television in the early 2000s, English football has come to fill the sports pages of every Ugandan paper, as well as eating up the radio and television schedules. Nine out of 10 inmates who I spoke to supported a Premier League team. The same was true of the guards, nearly all of whom were Arsenal supporters. Every day, during my time at Upper Prison, a young inmate named White Angel – “because I’m good inside” – would come and find me to discuss the latest news from Arsenal and Tottenham. “Do you really think Soldado was worth the money at Spurs? Do you have Ars&egrave;ne Wenger’s address? Could you get a letter out to him?” John, one of the guys who drove us to the prison each day, followed Chelsea, or “my Chelsea” as he preferred to put it. Our trips around Kampala were always accompanied by the staccato rap of Lugandan football commentary on the radio, broken by ecstatic English: “Oh my God! Ross Barkley! Ross Barkley! Ross Barkley! Goal!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0c0509df2c9be6f989e716670a246236a8eca7a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432735124256/0b47c530-18ee-4126-846d-4378808aefa5-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Opio Moses, who was sentenced to 20 years for murder, runs football at Luzira prison in Kampala\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opio Moses, who is serving a 20-year sentence for murder, is in charge of football at Luzira prison.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Kabuubi/EAPPA images/Demotix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The centre of the prison’s football culture is Boma A, the main prison yard, which is just big enough to accommodate a full-size pitch. On the first day I visited Luzira, in March, a match was due to take place. In the rainy season, which had not yet begun, the Boma sometimes resembles a grass pitch, but under searing sunlight it had been reduced to scorched red earth. At both goal ends there were two-storey cell-blocks, known as the wards. Along one touchline was a low school building with a tiny veranda under a corrugated iron roof – the only slice of shade available for a quietly gathering crowd of around 500. The game was just a friendly. Ward Two were in white, Ward Seven were in blue.</p> \n<p>Life in Luzira is colour-coded with precision. Remand prisoners and those serving less than 20 years are in intense canary yellow. Those serving more are in atomic tangerine. You get a red stripe for trying to escape, and blue trim for seniority and privilege. RPs – the regimental police – are the inmates who keep order in the Boma, and they get a white armband. Psychiatric patients are in green, their garb is the most ragged of all. The condemned, as they are known, waiting out time on death row, live separately and wear white.</p> \n<p>The guards are in tan with maroon trim. There are fewer than 100 on any given shift, responsible for over 3,500 prisoners in a space designed for 500. In a British prison the overall staff-to-inmate ratio is around 1:5. At Luzira the ratio is 1:15.<strong> </strong>According to the staff, a significant fraction of inmates should not be there – because they were framed or because the glacially slow Ugandan court system has left them on remand for years. But the majority of the people in Luzira have done awful things: murder, rape, armed robbery, kidnapping. Given all this, the atmosphere is remarkably tranquil. In the week that I spent there, I never had a sense that aggression was near. Of course, a guard was often around, but the mood was always calm. Everyone looked everyone in the eye.</p> \n<p>The match between the wards was highly physical but&nbsp;there was no time-wasting, no talking back and no slide-tackling, tripping or diving. Given the state of the pitch, it was remarkable that any player was able to complete a pass. Ball control skills, under impossible circumstances, are the mark of the best players in Luzira.</p> \n<p>Once the game was over and the Boma crowd were drifting back to the wards for the 3pm lock-up, Moses handed me a scrap of paper: “5 foot playing boots. 12 footballs. 3 volleyballs. 1 box of laundry soap. 2 Sets of Jersey. A Trophy. A Goat”. These were the supplies required if a tournament was to take place during the next week. Football at the prison comes in the form of kickabouts, practices, friendlies. But valued above all are the knockout tournaments, with trophies&nbsp;and prizes. After I had agreed to provide them all, Moses offered me a provisional schedule and I wondered where I would find a goat.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>16 March, first round<br /><strong>Manchester United 2 - 1 Arsenal</strong><br /><strong>Barcelona 4 - 3 Aston Villa</strong><br /><strong>Juventus 0 - 0 Hannover 96</strong><br /><em>(Hannover 96 won 4-2 on&nbsp;penalties)</em></p> \n<p>The opening match of the tournament was Manchester United vs Arsenal. United, of course, were the favourites, while the Luzira Arsenal were the minnows. Before the game could begin, the pitch needed to be marked out. The lines from the previous day’s match had been erased by the busy footfall of the Boma. An hour before kick-off, a pair of inmates stretched out a length of green string until it was taut; this was the guide line. Then a third, stooping low, his cupped hands holding a mound of manioc flour, moved along the string and let the flour fall through his fingers. The referees, dressed in a motley collection of part-black kits, were next to arrive and limbered up in the newly drawn centre circle. Members of the UPSA executive – chairman, vice chairman, secretary, treasurer and match officials – took up their positions against the chainlink fence on the halfway line and checked their team sheets.</p> \n<p>Players arrived one by one and began to mingle with what was left of the morning Boma crowd: broom-makers, draughts players and lounging conversationalists. Slowly, as people drifted to the sidelines and the shade, the teams emerged on the pitch, while the referees and UPSA officials conferred. Money is not permitted in the prison, so there was no coin to be tossed to decide which team would play at which end. The teams posed for photographs, six standing at the back, five squatting at the front. The referee checked in with his assistants, looked at his watch, held his arm aloft, and blew the whistle.</p> \n<p>Prisoners have been playing football in the Boma for decadesas long as anyone can remember, but inmates began to create more formal clubs with managers, coaches and fans around the turn of the century, shortly after more liberal conditions were introduced. The first club to emerge was Liverpool, which was founded around 2000 by a group of a dozen former soldiers who had turned to armed robbery. Despite being incarcerated, they were able to draw on the wealth they had accumulated outside the jail to obtain the best kit and attract the prison’s best players.</p> \n<p>Manchester United were the team of non-Bugundans. In the 19th century, the Bugunda were the leading tribe of the central region of Uganda. They were used as an instrument of devolved colonial rule by the British, who gave them more autonomy than any other tribal group. Too small to dominate post-colonial Uganda – a nation-state that began life in 1962 with at least 50 ethnic groups and languages within its borders – there continued to be tension between the Bugunda and other tribes. Manchester United, in their early days, gathered rural prisoners and inmates from peripheral tribes in the north and east, united by their marginalised status.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3636f758206605e14f254b68d5f15f0ddb0ceca7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432735547081/851342ea-7eb1-4487-acec-96b262185c59-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Manchester United play Liverpool on a pitch surrounded by watching prison inmates.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manchester United play Liverpool on a pitch surrounded by watching prison inmates.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Kabuubi/EAPPA images/Demotix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Today, Liverpool and Manchester United remain the largest clubs in the prison, reflecting the huge support enjoyed by their namesakes within the wider Ugandan population. But there are other challengers. A side called the Orange Bees, created by former students of Kampala’s Makere University, became known as the “team of the elites”. After the release of its founders in 2003, it mutated into Chelsea FC, which has established itself as the tribune of youthful talent. The same year, Woodworkers FC and Kitchen FC became Juventus and Germany respectively. Rebranding as Germany proved so unpopular that the team was once again renamed, this time as Aston Villa. Newcastle United was the brainchild of Angina Boscso, a man renowned in the prison for his skill as a talent spotter, and his deftness at buying players cheap and selling them dear. Boscso has been released but Newcastle endures, now serving as a feeder club and academy for Liverpool.</p> \n<p>Prince FC turned into Everton – the league’s perennial underdogs – a club that is staffed by Kampala street kids, ex-addicts and dealers. Police FC, a testament to the number of former officers in this jail, became the suitably rough-house Leeds United. The financial demise and multiple relegations of the team’s English counterpart in the mid-2000s led to it changing its name once more. It became Hannover 96, and Manchester United’s feeder club; though one dogged fan, Brian, who came to talk to me almost every day, had trouble saying goodbye to the glory years and still insisted on calling it Leeds.</p> \n<p>The two newest clubs are Barcelona and Arsenal. Although most inmates come from poor backgrounds, occasionally someone really powerful ends up in Luzira on remand – a businessman, an opposition politician, a high-ranking soldier – though they rarely stay long. A Kampala businessman, long since released, was so enamoured by the short-passing tiki-taka style of Barcelona circa 2009 that he created a namesake side out of thin air. Arsenal, meanwhile, benefited from the wider popularity in Uganda of the team that had won the Premier League in 2004, unbeaten and invincible. Luzira’s Arsenal is known as the Catholic team – another kind of minority group in predominantly protestant Uganda.</p> \n<p>The way in which the clubs are run is now strictly regulated by the UPSA constitution. They must have their own constitutions, a chairman, coach, secretary and treasurer, a minimum of 16 registered players and a maximum of 25. Each club also has its fans, who are essential in providing services and resources to develop the side; they are the errand-runners who specialise in finding people when meetings are called, the cobblers who patch up boots, the medics and the healers.</p> \n<p>Manchester United has a trio of fanatical supporters who carry their own tiny banner and regularly run on to the pitch when the team scores, which it regularly does. Luzira’s single Chinese inmate is also a fan. His huge United beach towel, weighted with plastic water bottles, hangs from the barred windows of an upper floor cell behind one of the goals. Arsenal has its own little group of ultras, too, while Liverpool’s supporters have made a flag recalling the Hillsborough disaster and the club’s most recent European cup triumph.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the most important role the fans play is donating kits and food to their clubs in order to attract the best players. Watching the opening rounds of the tournament, it soon became clear that the Manchester United and Liverpool players were noticeably bigger and evidently better-fed than the others. Everton and Chelsea’s squads, in particular, looked spindly; these clubs have a tiny fan base within Luzira so their players are more reliant on the basic food ration: porridge in the morning and a supper of <em>posho</em> – a glutinous mash made of manioc – and beans, which are so tough they need to be boiled for eight hours. <em>Posho</em> is particularly hard going: sticky yet dry, pulped but gritty, and utterly tasteless.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ea31d9dbde6262d8e3dc3562ba583a20f17c8421\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432736116777/19882137-f024-4a66-962f-43d3d81508a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Liverpool keeper stands in front of his goal and a packed crowd.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Liverpool keeper stands in front of his goal and a packed crowd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Kabuubi/EAPPA images/Demotix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite the dedication of the prison’s football fans, the crowd that turned out for the tournament, which often numbered more than 1,500, was curiously quiet. There was some joy and jubilation, stray shouts and calls, the occasional hug and holler, but it was hardly a cauldron. Opio Moses reminded me that fans are not above the rule of law and that constitutionally, the clubs have been made responsible for their behaviour. Unsporting conduct by the crowd is punished as severely as it is on the pitch.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>17 March, first round<br /><strong>Everton 1 – 1 Newcastle United</strong><em> (Newcastle won 5-4 on pens)</em><br /><strong>Liverpool 0 – 0 Chelsea </strong><em>(Chelsea won 5-4 on penalties)</em></p> \n<p>The next day, early in the second half of the Liverpool-Chelsea game, play was stopped for over 20 minutes when a hundred sacks of manioc flour, which had just been delivered to the prison, needed to be carried across the pitch. Jonathan Mugerwa, a match official, who had to keep a report of players, substitutions, goals and cards, noted this down. Later on, all the match reports would be collated and a detailed official account of the tournament produced, handwritten on lined paper and filed in UPSA’s own archive.</p> \n<p>Life in Luzira wasn’t always like this. The prison was built by the British in the 1920s, 30 years after Uganda had been made a British protectorate. The imperial state replaced the British East African Company as Uganda’s notional rulers but, with very few colonists on the ground, the country was run by a system of divide-and-rule that delegated power to selected tribal groups. In its colonial incarnation, the prison was less crowded than today but still barbaric: pitiful living conditions, institutionalised humiliation and a harsh regime of discipline including the use of punishment cells, deliberately flooded with water to make them uninhabitable. The British, who finally left in 1962, used the prison to house nationalists and political dissidents.</p> \n<p>Post-colonial Uganda was no more humane to its prison population. Idi Amin’s eccentric and brutal dictatorship in the 1970s was followed by coups, uncertainty and a gruelling civil war that destroyed the economy, what was left of the Ugandan state, and made the use of violence and torture the norm. By the early 1990s, Luzira was ravaged by HIV and so starved of funding that less than a quarter of the prisoners could be supplied with even a blanket; inmates buried the dead in mass graves and grew vegetables on the same ground to keep the living fed. In 1993, a group of former soldiers staged a two-day riot that required an intervention by the army and left two prisoners dead and many injured.</p> \n<p>Something had to change. In 1999, the high commissioner of the Ugandan Prison Service, Joseph Etima, a progressive who also opposed the death penalty, declared an open-door policy to the outside world. At Luzira, the Red Cross and Swedish development agencies brought money, best practice and international law. Local churches and European NGOs, including the <a href=\"http://www.africanprisons.org/\" title=\"\">African Prisons Project</a>, began to improve healthcare and living conditions. Together they inculcated a hybrid prison culture that drew on western concepts of human rights and individual rehabilitation, Christian notions of redemption and forgiveness, and African traditions of collectivism and restitutive justice. The success of the prison depends on keeping the peace, the fragile rule of law and the consent of the prisoners themselves.</p> \n<p>Wilson Magomu began working at Luzira around the time that the changes first started. After a decade rising through the ranks of the prison service, working in provincial jails, he returned in 2011 as officer-in-charge. Magomu is a big man who moves through the prison with unhurried poise, shuffling between his three mobile phones, dispensing orders, casting an eye over the CCTV. He seems to speak and think in the same manner. Recalling a visit to Belmarsh prison in London he observed: “You have all of the technology, but you do not have calm.” He looked out of the window into the Boma. “I have just 100 guards on duty to look after more than 3,000 of my inmates,” he said. “I have to have calm.” He believes that adding guns, as is common in America, makes matters worse. “There, the guards are afraid of your inmates and your inmates are afraid of the guards. This causes tension. I do not like to work in a place that is full of tension.” There is an implicit deal at Luzira. Prisoners will be incarcerated but their rights will be respected. Violence will not be tolerated. Laws and rules are applied consistently. In return, the prisoners must not only stay put, they must help to run and organise the place.</p> \n<p>UPSA was one product of this system. In the early 2000s, individual football clubs existed and there was a desire for competition, but no neutral organisation to make it happen. So in 2003, the administration and the prisoners created UPSA. The body’s leading figures are voted in annually by an electoral college of the prison’s referees, the clubs and their officials. It has the practical and logistical task of seeking out sponsors and putting on properly refereed tournaments. It must regulate and negotiate with the football clubs and the prison administration over the use of the Boma, behaviour and discipline, and the timing of tournaments.</p> \n<p>Like any football association it runs a player-registration system – one that requires players to appear in person on three consecutive days once a year at a specific place in the Boma. It has also had to police the black market in players as clubs have used every means at their disposal – extra food, contraband, blackmail and persuasion – to get them to switch teams. Two years ago UPSA introduced transfer windows, two short periods each year in which players can move between clubs.</p> \n<p>In this regard, UPSA is part of a long African nationalist tradition of football as a school of administration, politics and democracy. Before the first world war, Albert Luthuli, an early president of the ANC, was vice president of an African football association in Durban. Then, in the 1940s, the trade unions formed in Bulawayo were led by shop stewards who also captained the Zimbabwean teams Matabele Highlanders and Red Army.</p> \n<p>But there is another tradition at work in the UPSA constitution. The preamble to the most recent edition, written by the inmates themselves, brings to mind the Victorian moralists and public-school teachers who saw football as a school of character, an ethical, even spiritual, enterprise. These were the kind of Britons who brought imperial rule, Christianity and football to Uganda in the late 19th century.</p> \n<p><em>We the inmates of Ugandan Government Prison Upper </em><br /><em>- OBSERVING that society imprisoned us demanding that we learn to adhere to the rule of Law, and</em><br /><em>- DESIROUS of transforming ourselves into Law abiding citizens.</em><br /><em>- YET REALISING the inestimable influence to abide by the rules and regulations on all who culture themselves to regular competitive sports activities.</em><br /><em>- AWARE of the benefits of physical fitness and entertainment effect of sports to human health,</em><br /><em>- AND NOTING the development of the talents of the youths that can be delivered from sporting events</em><br /><em>- DO SOLEMNLY DECIDE to enact and adopt the following articles as the constitution of the Uganda Upper Government Prison</em><strong><em> </em></strong><em>sports fraternity.</em></p> \n<p>The reformers of the English public schools sought to turn out muscular Christian gentleman who would go on to rule the empire. UPSA has been trying something much harder. Through football, its members have been trying to turn themselves into citizens ready to rejoin a society they damaged. You can read it in their words and you can see it in their play. Dissent, football’s code word for slagging off the referee, is almost entirely absent. Unsporting behaviour of any kind is frowned upon. A red card means a two-month ban from football – an agonising punishment for any player here.</p> \n<p>The Liverpool-Chelsea game went to penalties. When Chelsea scored the winning goal, Jonathan Mugerwa made the final entry in his notebook and then turned back to his Bible. Before he arrived in the prison, Mugerwa sold shoes on the streets of downtown Kampala. He was, in his own words, a drinker and a drug taker, an illiterate troublemaking youth. One evening, a man suspected of multiple robberies in his neighbourhood was caught and confronted by a small group of angry locals. By the time Jonathan and his friends arrived after a night of drinking, the crowd had turned violent, and Jonathan joined them. As Mugerwa told the story, his eyes remained fixed on me but his voice trembled. “I am here because of mob justice. I played my part, but my greatest sin was not to save the boy.” Now, Mugerwa has finished high school, works as a counsellor, and has turned himself into to a poet and pastor. He eyed me, in all seriousness, and said: “Timothy 2, Chapter 2, Verse 5. An athlete is not crowned in glory unless he competes according to the rules.”</p> \n<h2><strong>* * *</strong></h2> \n<p>19 March, semi-finals<br /><strong>Barcelona 1 – 2 Manchester United </strong><br /><strong>Newcastle United 0 - 1 Hannover 96</strong></p> \n<p>In the first of the semi-finals, Barcelona took an early lead but I missed the goal; Bertrand Lavalle was talking to me again. A short, round-faced Congolese man, he was simultaneously delighted to be speaking French and exasperated that he could not form DRC FC, a Congolese football team. “<em>Oui, Il y a beaucoup de discrimination, Professor. Il y a un probl&egrave;me congolais.</em>” During the second half, as Manchester United turned the tide, I asked Opio Moses why UPSA would not let Bertrand form a team. Moses patiently explained the Congolese problem to me. First, clubs have to join in pairs. As there are already 10 clubs, adding a single club makes matters impossible. Second, “We do not seek to encourage teams that are tribal.” There had been trouble in the past with this, explained Moses. (I pointed out that Arsenal were Catholics and that Manchester United were once non-Bugundans, but Moses demurred). Third, English is the official language of UPSA. “The administration cannot have a team speaking only French.”</p> \n<p>As we were talking, Manchester United equalised and the crowd, a little more excitable today, began advancing over the touchline and on to the field. Moses, who is neither large nor loud, gently waved them back behind the line with understated but impressive authority – an authority derived in part from his status as chairman of UPSA. When he has done his time, Moses plans to found an NGO devoted to bringing vocational education to the prison. “Football is so good for many things, but it will not allow a man to eat,” he said.</p> \n<p>Moses’s predecessors were no less politically adept. In the early days of UPSA there was a widespread problem of bribery, as ambitious chairmen paid opposition players in food and contraband goods to throw games. The organisation was also threatened by a breakaway movement, fired by discontent amongst the devotees of sports other than football. Even more seriously, in 2006 the highly polarised atmosphere of Ugandan politics found its way into Luzira. Clubs began to align themselves with President Yoweri Museveni’s governing National Resistance Movement party or the opposition Democratic party. Competition turned to conflict, referees lost control of games. Now, by force of law, clubs must not assume a political identity. Bribery, always illegal, was tackled by the UPSA executive, who persuaded club chairman that it was better to spend their resources on making their team better, rather than making other teams worse. The indoor sports and volleyball fraternities have been given their own administrative committees, and UPSA has a legal duty to promote these minority interests.</p> \n<p>“Above all, while making decisions and dispensing the rule of law you should incline to the constitution,” Moses said with quiet pride. Alex Rwinomugisha, the chair of the referee’s committee joined us as Hannover 96 squeezed past Newcastle United. An imperiously tall former solider, imprisoned for 20 years for shooting a man, Rwinomugisha agreed that the constitution is important. But, he added, the rule of law needs referees as well as words, and of course no one wants to sponsor the referees. Did I see the kit they were wearing, the state of their boots? How can we improve as referees without coaching? I promised Alex that I would find them new kit for tomorrow’s final, and Moses that I would track down the goat.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p>20 March, final<br /><strong>Manchester United 5 – 1 Hannover 96</strong></p> \n<p>On the morning of the final, a marquee was erected. A table of honour was laid with the prison’s cleanest white cloth and a plastic rose centrepiece. The Guardian Spring Trophy 2015 was placed behind it. The officer-in-charge’s straight-backed chair, with its brushed red velvet cushion, sat centre-stage. The inmates put on their smartest and cleanest kit, making their yellow and orange glow more incandescent than ever. Manchester United saved their best for last with official-looking away jerseys. Their opponents, who had hitherto played in the strip of the Portuguese national team and shirts that must have come for a Coca-Cola-sponsored youth tournament, had the real thing on today: maroon Hannover 96 jerseys. The referees were wearing the new matching black strips I had bought for them in downtown. They looked the part.</p> \n<p>By mid-morning, two hours before kick-off, the musicians had arrived and old Congolese rumba crackled out of the prison’s PA. The entertainment programme began with ritual circumcision dances from the north, wild hip-swirling gyrations, accompanied by harps and home-made pipes. A two-man wooden xylophone and drum ensemble combined to play traditional music from the east of the country. We heard dancehall reggae tunes that declaimed the pain of prison life, and comic African pop on the importance of the soap bar in the economics of the jail.</p> \n<p>The final itself was a walkover. Manchester United scored twice in the first half, wobbled for a moment at 2-1, and then scored three more. At the final whistle, their small coterie of flag-wavers did half a victory lap but everyone else, even the team, headed for the marquee, the shade and the prizes. Magomu, the officer-in-charge, was stern, but visibly swelling with pride that his inmates had put on such an extraordinary show of organisation, or as he liked to say, “maximum discipline”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d40c82bf03f8f1b935e7b14c51c858e66b52bfd1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432739748986/d027991a-aa87-41e1-bd9a-590b9bec1db1-460x299.jpeg\" alt=\"One of the Luzira prison inmates holds the Radio Simba football tournament trophy won by Manchester United.\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the Luzira inmates holds a trophy won by Manchester United.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ronald Kabuubi/EAPPA images/Demotix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Opio Moses addressed the crowd: “Generally a prisoner is deemed, and is by definition, a person quite incapable of following and abiding by established laws and regulations. Soccer tends to correct this disability.” He also asked that I become UPSA’s official ambassador to the Premier League. I promised that they will get their place in the global history of football, and that I would come back and see them again.</p> \n<p>It was time for the prizes, hastily distributed from the table of honour as the clock ticked towards lock-up time. Manchester United got the new set of jerseys, Hannover 96 were awarded the goat, though it still had not shown up. The referees and the executive committee got sugar and soap, notebooks and pens. Everyone got toothbrushes: the clubs and committees, all the players and musicians, the Boma chief<strong>,</strong> the regimental police, the cobbler who makes boots last forever and, finally, the line-markers and net man. (Most inmates do not posses a functioning toothbrush.)</p> \n<p>The biggest cheer of the day was reserved for the announcement that I had stumped up for a new satellite decoder for the TV that sits in its own corrugated iron hut, and enough of a subscription to get the men through to the end of the Premier League season. The goat, it later transpired, had been delivered to the wrong address and had been eaten.

The pair had just been rescued from a life raft after they made it off Goldfinger’s plane.</p> \n<p>Pussy asks 007 “not in a gangster’s voice, or a Lesbian’s, but in a girl’s voice, ‘Will you write to me in Sing Sing?’” Bond looks into her “deep blue-violet eyes that were no longer hard, imperious”, and says: “They told me you only liked women.” Pussy replies: “I never met a man before,” and Bond’s mouth “came ruthlessly down on hers”.</p> \n<p>“It was great fun revisiting the most famous Bond girl of all – although she is by no means the only dangerous lady in Trigger Mortis,” said Horowitz. “I hope fans enjoy it. My aim was to make this the most authentic James Bond novel anyone could have written.”</p> \n<p>Lucy Fleming, the niece of Ian Fleming, said “it was almost as if Ian had written [Trigger Mortis] himself”.</p> \n<p>“It does feel like a Fleming book,” she said. “It takes place a couple of weeks after Goldfinger – Pussy’s back, which is fantastic, and we’ve got a particularly good villain in Sin – he’s absolutely horrible, a megalomaniac type, but fascinating as well … Pussy Galore is one of the iconic characters from the films and the books … It will be interesting to see what the public make of that.”</p> \n<p>Although novelists including Jeffrey Deaver, Sebastian Faulks and William Boyd have all written authorised new Bond novels, Horowitz is the first to place his work directly within Fleming’s original canon, to continue the adventures of one of the Bond girls created by the novelist, and to work with previously unpublished Fleming material.</p> \n<p>“Each writer has their own style, but I think Anthony is closest to Ian’s style,” said Lucy Fleming. “And he has the page-turning effect of making you think ‘what the hell is going to happen next?’ … He’s worked Murder on Wheels in brilliantly – it’s woven into the whole thing. It was just a treatment, really, with the idea for the plot.”</p> \n<p>Orion Publishing will release Trigger Mortis on 8 September. Fleming wrote 14 Bond books in total, from 1953’s Casino Royale to 1966’s The Living Daylights. More than 100m 007 books have been sold worldwide.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432740938098/da60ba4f-da0f-4569-b5aa-4737e2a1a445-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Allstar/United Artists","altText":"Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore in the 1964 film of Goldfinger.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Allstar/United Artists"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432741433163/63372d39-e09d-48f4-af0f-7384dbfb6d37-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"The cover for the new novel, due this September.

Small freezer unit enveloping a removable bucket and motorised paddles. Chills and aerates ice-cream custards and sorbet syrups.</p> \n<h2>Why?</h2> \n<p>Because restoring the means&nbsp;of production to workers leads to a less-alienated dessert. Basically, making your own ice-cream is awesome.</p> \n<h2>Well?</h2> \n<p>I remember childhood attempts at homemade ice-cream, hand mixed every 30 minutes into a crystal suspension like broken glass and paint. I’ve encountered machines that require pre-freezing for seven aeons. This thing breezily assures you perfect ice-cream is possible with no prep in 40 minutes. Ignoring the no-doubt terrible magic under the hood that makes this possible, I challenge it to create sorbet from scratch in&nbsp;an hour.</p> \n<p>Obviously, some of this is down to me. In a blender, I puree strawberries, caster sugar and lemon juice. OK, that’s me done.</p> \n<p>I sieve the mixture into the bucket, place it in the belly of the beast, and start the timer. From its name, size, and simplicity of design, this machine exudes confidence. It’s like a restaurant with one thing on the menu, or a business card without a number on it. An attractive blue digital readout and three buttons are all you get.</p> \n<p>There are no unnecessary settings, or ice-cream van jingles – the attention is in the engineering. Yet I&nbsp;spend half an hour staring into the crimson whirlpool, hypnotised: the best attributes a gadget can have are elegance of function, and fascination. It’s quieter than I expected, venting cool air, then warm. It’s so emotionally self-contained; I yearn to be it.</p> \n<p>It gets on with it, and then it’s done. I’m staggered by my own redundancy – washing the bucket takes seconds. I try some of the produce: it’s faultless. Flavours fully retained, smoothly granular texture. It’s a shade soft – I’d put it in the freezer over dinner for perfection.</p> \n<p>This is a macho machine, vaguely smug: it feels less about childish treats on sunny days than whipping up peanut-butter ice-cream, rosewater gelato and basil sorbets to make your friends feel bad about their lives. There’s nothing sweeter than that, of course. But I’m not sure you could take any of the credit.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb6da509fa75d6901e47dc03fcf25c933940d8f1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432722205451/abdcef14-74c2-4dd0-a041-cf35f23567ac-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tuck in …\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tuck in …</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi/Christian Sinibaldi</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Any downsides?</h2> \n<p>It’s very expensive, and very large, and very good.

Now he’s excited again – and so are Microsoft, Google and Facebook …</p>","byline":"Charles Arthur","body":"<p>Dr Jonathan Waldern is standing in a meeting room in Silicon Valley, wearing a lab coat and grinning from ear to ear. “There will be people crying in this, people falling in love, people falling over. For all sorts of reasons, this strikes at the core of being a human being. It’s so compelling … this is as big an opportunity as the internet.”</p> \n<p>He’s talking about virtual reality (VR), the immersive systems that cover your eyes (and ideally ears) and fool your brain into thinking you’re somewhere, or even someone, else. Waldern, 54, is a veteran of the business: in the 90s, his company Virtuality was a pioneer in commercial VR, offering an arcade game experience in which a bulky headset transformed the room into a prehistoric scene in which pterodactyls swooped over and around you, and you tried to shoot them with your gun.</p> \n<p>The last time I saw Waldern was in the UK, more than 20 years ago. Virtuality, which he had brought to the London stock market, was in talks with Atari to bring its ambitious Jaguar headset to consumers. But the deal fell apart, and then so did Virtuality. The market for VR shrank to zero almost overnight; its speed and completeness foreshadowed the dot-com boom and bust of 2000-2001.</p> \n<p>But, just as the dot-coms evolved and returned like mammals emerging from a meteor strike, VR has come back too. And that’s what Waldern, who now runs a Silicon Valley company called Digilens, is excited about. He sees the field enjoying a resurgence, its long hibernation is over. And survivors like him are emerging to capitalise on the new boom. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2825650b9e77fae0a8efbd1afab5a7f0ad6d5f8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432649931726/ad102258-d7e4-4e79-b152-e0a41d08886c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 at the Consumer Electronics Show, Shanghai.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 at the Consumer Electronics Show, Shanghai.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It’s a very small community [in VR] around here,” Waldern continues, referring to the west coast. (Though it transpires that when he says “small”, he means “in the thousands, but geographically close”.) “The cost of development in this realm is so high that very few corporations would take it on. Only the big three – Microsoft, Google, Facebook. Apple is the fourth, but isn’t so prominent.”</p> \n<p>Does that mean Apple is looking at VR too? “I couldn’t possibly comment,” says Waldern, and grins. (Apple<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/feb/18/apple-patent-virtual-reality-iphone-carrying-headset\"> filed a patent in September 2008</a> for putting an iPhone into a headset, and<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/patents/US20140098009\"> another in 2014</a>, but there’s been little other sign of activity on that front from the company.)</p> \n<p>Even if it isn’t, the presence of the other three big companies in this space shows how hot VR has suddenly become. Oculus Rift,<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/mar/25/facebook-buys-virtual-reality-gaming-firm-oculus\"> bought by Facebook for $2bn</a> in March 2014, has been the poster child for the new face of this technology; the company now<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/06/facebook-oculus-rift-virtual-reality-2016\"> aims to launch a headset for consumers in 2016</a>. It will have challengers though. Sony is working on Project Morpheus, which<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/04/sony-morpheus-playstation-4-ps4-virtual-reality-headset-to-launch-2016\"> has the same aim</a>, and HTC has built<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/02/htc-vive-developers-react-to-valve-virtual-reality-headset\"> Vive, unveiled at Mobile World Congress in March</a>, which will work with the Valve system for downloadable games. Samsung has its own Gear VR, developed with Oculus. Even Google’s Cardboard, a DIY system which you literally fold together from a cardboard template before sticking your smartphone into a slot a few inches from your eyes, has had around 1.2m downloads since Google introduced it at its I/O developer conference in May 2014. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile the parallel development of “augmented reality” (where objects and data are overlaid on to the scene you see in front of you) is growing quickly, too, with Microsoft’s Hololens the most promising offering to date, along with Google-funded Magic Leap. (Google Glass, which is undergoing a rethink, is like a subset of AR.)</p> \n<p>But it’s VR that has everyone excited. In March 2014, Chris Dixon, a partner at the increasingly influential venture capital company Andreessen Horowitz, <a href=\"http://cdixon.org/2014/03/25/oculus/\">observed</a> that using an early version of Oculus Rift the year before was one of “a handful of technology demos in my life that made me feel like I was glimpsing into the future” – and his list ran back as far as the Apple II computer from the 70s. </p> \n<p>VR, he noted, “has long been a staple of science fiction” (of which Star Trek: the Next Generation’s “holodeck” was only the most recent) but hardware was now cheap enough, and engineers keen enough to explore a new frontier, that it could finally deliver on the science fiction promise. (Dixon’s team cashed out on Facebook’s acquisition of Oculus Rift.)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Imyn6QSq9s\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2Imyn6QSq9s?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Virtuality promo film\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the 90s, VR certainly felt like SF. Waldern’s company relied on top-end Silicon Graphics systems with six-figure price tags. There’s a<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Imyn6QSq9s\"> video of him from 1994</a> at W Industries, showing how pixellated the experience was. “Our system used some of the very first Sony LCDs, with 300 by 200 pixels,” Waldern recalls. “Today you get 1,080p [1,080 horizontal lines] minimum, and by the launch next year you’ll probably have 4K by 4K. And the computational power is transformational – we were working on about a megaflop, and each machine cost about $70,000, which is a massive barrier to adoption. Now with an Nvidia GPU you’re talking about a teraflop.”</p> \n<p>VR is a complex real-time computing problem. Ideally, the fictional scene should show no individual pixels, fill your field of view – which in normally sighted people covers 180 degrees – and change without any lag, no matter how quickly you move your head. That means the system has to be able to calculate what the scene will look like at any point, and incorporate the movement of your head, reported from the helmet, into its computation, and update the screens quickly enough to give the sensation of realistic movement.</p> \n<p>Measurement of head movement is done using accelerometers and gyroscopes; the screens can now offer millions of pixels just inches from your eyes; computing power aims to cut lag and latency. The latter can quickly induce nausea if the scene isn’t redrawn quickly enough as the body’s balance system disagrees with what the eyes tell it they’re seeing; that was a key problem with early VR systems.</p> \n<p>But those are being overcome, thanks to the rapid growth of the smartphone industry. That has made accelerometers and gyroscopic chips cheap, plentiful and fast, while also pushing the quality of displays to a level where you can’t distinguish pixels even in screens a few inches from your eyes. That though requires graphics processors that can handle huge numbers of floating point operations per second (flops) – but, as Waldern says, that’s available.</p> \n<p>Among those eagerly exploiting that space is Professor Bob Stone, chair of interactive multimedia systems at the University of Birmingham, and another British veteran of the 1990s boom and bust. After another 20-year gap, I caught up with him as he travelled from a location where he had been using a drone to create a 3D “point cloud” of a church and archaeological dig in Wiltshire; in just five minutes of flight it captured enough data to create a realistic 3D model that one could “fly” through at leisure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"440d31c63c731a50d391fb76f59a2bc19686d1f2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432647505815/f42a3b7b-9ccb-4182-91da-57d64363d2cd-460x97.jpeg\" alt=\"Image, 'point cloud' and reconstructed image captured by drone for virtual reality overview of archaeological dig by Prof Bob Stone.\" width=\"460\" height=\"97\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Image, ‘point cloud’ and reconstructed image captured by drone for virtual reality overview of archaeological dig by Prof Bob Stone.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dropbox</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When we spoke, Stone initially seemed unimpressed by Oculus’s offering, suggesting that “it’s not much different from the headsets of the late 1990s”. He cited “pixel bleed” (where the pixels don’t appear sharp) and limits on the field of view. “We’re using Oculus Rift development kit 2 [the latest version] in defence projects, because it’s the best of a bad bunch,” he said. Why bad? Stone feels that if you have to wear something, “you aren’t really experiencing total immersion”; he thinks ideally VR should simply feel like life. “More than 20 years on, shouldn’t we be further ahead than this?” he asks.<br /></p> \n<p>But later he emails, relenting on his apparent negativity: “VR has been my career for over 28 years now, and I genuinely believe in what VR can deliver when the technologies are applied appropriately and with the needs of the end users and end organisations well and truly in mind. As I said, it seems that every seven years we see the same old issues and hype coming through (these days via the web, YouTube, etc) that people out there seem to believe without question!”</p> \n<p>The original bust in VR came when first-generation products were crushed by the weight of expectations. So what led to the renaissance of VR – and why has it taken so long?</p> \n<p>Waldern reckons a key reason is that games, which were the main consumer-facing use for VR, shifted to a different set of genres. “There are periodic cycles in the games industry, for technologies and genres. People want change from time to time.” After a couple of decades of 2D and pseudo-3D offerings (think of Nintendo’s games, and Quake and Doom), gamers are ready for an “immersive” experience, he argues. </p> \n<p>Digilens’s work involves building optical waveguides, so that projected images can fill or overlay the field of vision. Most of the uses on the company site involve business, rather than consumer, application, but Waldern sees all sorts of potential. “Why do you think Microsoft bought Minecraft?” he asks. “Hololens is perfect for it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/01/ultrahaptics-gaming-technology-feel-invisible-objects-oculus-rift\">Touchy subject: a breakthrough for gaming and virtual reality</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Stone agrees: “One thing that saved VR was that while we were running around talking about headsets and gloves, the gaming community was coming up underneath, and came up with software and hardware in the quest for the best quality games. That drove down the cost of computing with graphics, and also made available a number of toolkits for games-quality virtual worlds that people could sympathise with.” Games drove costs down: “Things that in the late 1990s cost six-figure sums you can now do on an &pound;800 laptop.”</p> \n<p>Brian Blau, research director at analysis company Gartner, forecast in March – before Oculus’s announcement of a tentative release date – that there would be 2m VR headsets sold in 2016, rising to 8m in 2018; in all he thinks there could be 25m in use within a few years.</p> \n<p>That doesn’t sound quite like the gigantic opportunity that Waldern described. But VR is seeing a growing number of uses in commercial spaces, where the ability to train people, or give them a new perspective, is valuable. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media-network/2015/may/19/virtual-reality-nba-nfl-nancy-bennett\">Virtual reality offers NBA and NFL fans a more immersive experience</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But it’s not the military, or even games, which might be the most effective users of VR. One can imagine scores of scenarios where it would be transformative. Planning your next holiday? Why not “visit” the alternatives first, via a headset? Games, exploration, psychiatry and many other fields could all be revolutionised. “Sex, of course,” says Stone. “We’ve seen some crazy devices coming out of Japan.” He points to healthcare, education and training as other fields that are most likely to take it up quickly.</p> \n<p>Facebook’s purchase of Oculus, though, suggests that it sees the capability to transform how we interact with friends – which is what Waldern is thinking of when he talks about it potentially being bigger than the internet.</p> \n<p>“Even back at the start, the biggest kick we got was when we used ISDN lines between Berlin and London, and we linked players up in a game. It was amazing: you could meet, play, talk with people. Now, games have been doing that virtually for a while. But when you can feel you’re really meeting someone, right there, as a jolly alien or Robin Hood …” He stretches for the words. “Immersivity is the main thing. This has many years to run, and we have to get to where we are totally convinced – but we’re looking at something which has transformational capability for society.”</p> \n<p></p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432647844407/dbd0e1e2-29d3-4ff4-984e-c4b9e28a9ecd-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"STR/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"A visitor tries the Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 at the first Consumer Electronics Show in Asia, in Shanghai on Tuesday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432649933260/ad102258-d7e4-4e79-b152-e0a41d08886c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Oculus Rift Development Kit 2 at the Consumer Electronics Show, Shanghai.
