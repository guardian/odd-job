For some, the past dozen years had taken no obvious toll on their body’s biology.<br /></p> \n<p> But others were not so fortunate. A good many participants had biological ages in the 50s, while one, described by scientists as an “extreme case”, had a biological age of 61 years old. That meant that for every birthday over the past dozen years, their body had aged three years.</p> \n<p>“The overwhelming majority are biologically in their mid-40s or younger, but there are a handful of cases who are in pretty bad shape. In the future, we’ll come to learn about the different lives that fast and slow ageing people have lived,” said Daniel Belsky at Duke University in North Carolina.<br /></p> \n<p>The researchers drew on data gathered on 871 people enrolled in the Dunedin study, a major investigation that has tracked the health and broader lives of around 1000 New Zealanders born in 1972 or 1973 in the town of Dunedin, New Zealand. Of the original group, 30 had died by the age of 38 due to serious diseases such as cancer, or by accidents, suicides and drug overdoses. <br /></p> \n<p>“Our goal was to see if we can measure ageing in young people,” said Belsky. “It’s becoming increasingly clear that ageing is really the cause of much of the disease and disability burden we face, but our existing science is based on ageing in older people who already have a lot of age-related diseases.”<br /></p> \n<p>According to Belsky, studying ageing in younger people gives researchers the best chance of teasing apart the biological changes that drive ageing from those that underpin specific diseases.<br /></p> \n<p>The scientists drew up a list of 18 biological markers that together reflect a person’s biological age. They included measures of kidney and liver function, cholesterol levels, cardiovascual fitness and the lengths of teleomeres, which are protective caps that sit on the ends of chromosomes. <br /></p> \n<p>The set of markers were measured when the volunteers were aged 26, then 32, and finally at the age of 38. The researchers then looked to see how much the markers changed over time, to produce a “pace of ageing” figure.<br /></p> \n<p>Across the group, the biological ages of the 38-year-olds varied from 28 to 61. If a 38-year-old had a biological age of 40, it implied a “pace of ageing” of 1.2 years per year over the 12 year study period. Details of the study are published in <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1506264112\">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>“Even before they develop age-related diseases, their physiology shows signs, and there is great variation in how fast people ageed in the past 12 years,” Belsky said.<br /></p> \n<p>People with older biological ages fared worse on tests that are typically given to people over 60. These included tests of balance and coordination, but also mental tasks, such as solving unfamiliar problems. The biologically older people also reported more difficulties with activities like walking up the stairs.<br /></p> \n<p>The scientists went on to see whether volunteers’ biological ages matched how they old they looked. They invited students to view photos of the study participants and guess their ages. The biologically older people were consistently rated as looking older than their 38 years. <br /></p> \n<p>“Already, before midlife, individuals who were ageing more rapidly were less physically able, showed cognitive decline and brain ageing, self-reported worse health, and looked older,” the scientists write.<br /></p> \n<p>The next step in the research is to sift through the lives of the Dunedin participants to see how factors such as lifestyle, medical history, family circumstances, and stressful events might affect the speed at which people age. <br /></p> \n<p>Belsky called the study a “proof of concept” for using biological markers to measure the ageing process in people who are too young to have age-related diseases. An objective measure of biological age, he said, could be used to assess whether new anti-ageing therapies work or not in a reasonable time frame. <br /></p> \n<p>“What we need are measurements that can show whether these therapies are working, so we don’t have to wait 50 years to see if someone is still alive or not. We want a real-time barometer of how a peson is doing, and whether the therapy is really changing their rate of ageing,” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>The ultimate goal is to target ageing instead of the multiple separate diseases that people are increasingly likely to develop as they age. “As we get older, our risk grows for all kinds of different diseases. To prevent multiple diseases simultaneously, ageing itself has to be the target,” Belsky said.<br /></p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/049f6baaf8be940f8482152d0cc527505391300a/0_0_5434_3263/5434.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3263,"width":5434,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dimitri Otis/Getty Images","altText":"Scientists believe that measuring ageing in younger people will allow them to explore age-related disease and disability.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dimitri Otis/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T19:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T23:24:20Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":628,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Sample","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733739319/IanSample.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iansample"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Ageing","Science","Biology","Medical research"],"tags":[{"id":"science/ageing","webTitle":"Ageing"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"science/biology","webTitle":"Biology"},{"id":"science/medical-research","webTitle":"Medical research"}],"section":{"id":"science"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian Sample","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/iansample"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"science"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jul/06/old-before-your-time-people-age-at-wildly-different-rates-study-confirms","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adnn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/science/2015/jul/06/old-before-your-time-people-age-at-wildly-different-rates-study-confirms","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/06/old-before-your-time-people-age-at-wildly-different-rates-study-confirms"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/049f6baaf8be940f8482152d0cc527505391300a/0_0_5434_3263/5434.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3263,"width":5434,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Scientists believe that measuring ageing in younger people will allow them to explore age-related disease and disability.

We got off the plane – a Turkish Airlines Airbus, because our insurance companies had not countenanced our travelling by Iran Air – and joined the queue for passport control. I looked at my fellow travellers and thought I detected, over the natural melancholy of people who have been woken up at a cruel hour, a glitter of unease. We were a party of mostly Brits, Americans and Australians – you could hardly have devised a rainbow more likely to arouse the suspicions of the Iranian authorities – and we were entering a country that we had heard vilified all our adult lives, and to which our respective governments counsel against all travel unless absolutely necessary.</p> \n<p>Inside the airport, the members of the group shuffled uneasily forward to show their passports to young, unshaven men in bottle-green uniforms, or to their female counterparts, hooded and pale under the strip lighting. But these immigration officials turned out to be far from hostile, seeking only a virgin page, and some of them even smiled and made little jokes about being tired.</p> \n<p>I was along as the tour “expert” – so-called because I have lived in Iran, written about it and speak the language. Before the flight from Istanbul, one of the party had asked me if he should delete photos of a recent trip he had made to Israel. He feared his hard drive might be inspected at customs. I shook my head and said: “That’s not the way they operate in Iran.”</p> \n<p>Before leaving the airport with our luggage, we did have to put our cases through an x-ray, but this was for detecting contraband – not selfies in front of the Wailing Wall. Afterwards, I saw some members of our group give each other looks of bemusement, as if to say: “Well! That wasn’t like Argo at all!”</p> \n<p>As we were leaving the airport, our tour leaders, Ed and Katryn, called me over. They were standing next to an oval man in a blue suit. He was tamarind-brown from exposure to the sun and he carried an overstuffed computer bag.</p> \n<p>“Christopher,” Ed began, “I’d like you to meet Hossein, our local guide. And this,” he went on, gesturing towards me with a flourish, “is Chris, our Iran expert.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/may/26/iran-persian-gulf-islands-free-zone\">The forgotten land of colours: a trip through Iran's Persian Gulf</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When I had first accepted Ed and Katryn’s proposal that I join their party, it had occurred to me that our local guide might be offended that some random foreigner had been assigned to describe the country in preference to himself. But when I met Hossein I found no pique in his expression – only an odd, faintly inauspicious bonhomie.</p> \n<p>The following morning we gathered in the dining hall of our hotel for the stock Iranian five-star breakfast of quartered tomatoes, cucumbers, goats’ cheese and hard-boiled eggs. I moved among the tables and introduced myself.</p> \n<p>I immediately made friends with Tina, a retired senior social worker and fellow Londoner, and with Muriel, a former Qantas flight attendant who had married a minister in the Australian government, had appeared in Neighbours and was now enjoying a sunlit widowhood. From Ed and Katryn I knew that the members of the tour had all enjoyed success in professional lives that ranged from the law and medicine to fund management, oil-field troubleshooting and writing novels. And at least two of the group displayed that combination of piercing acuity and inadequate dress sense that I associate with genius.</p> \n<p>Many seemed to know each other from previous tours – North Korea and Ukraine occasioned much nostalgia – and, before long, they slipped into the repartee that is essential to groups of any kind, lubricated by the unfeasibly infantile humour of Ryan, a startup multimillionaire from Yorkshire with a rare talent for the double-entendre.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Who knows? Next time you’re here, there could be a McDonald’s on every corner</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Conversation in the dining hall was humming along when Katryn intervened to tell us to be on the coach in 10 minutes. Soon we were trundling through the lush valley of Marvdasht, towards the ancient city of Persepolis, and Ed&nbsp;thrust a microphone into my hand.</p> \n<p>Ed had told me that his clients visited countries in order to understand “how they work,” so it was with politics that I began my first group address as a tour guide. I used to be a journalist in Iran, and I know that politics and tourism are considered incompatible by many Iranians, including members of the country’s law-enforcement agencies. I had an uneasy feeling that by the time we were done, I would have a fuller understanding of the relationship between tourism and the security state.</p> \n<p>I began by stating the obvious: we were in Iran at a pivotal moment. Only weeks before, Iran and the world powers had struck a provisional deal limiting the Iranian nuclear programme and setting up further negotiations, with the potential to end one of the most enduring geopolitical enmities of recent decades.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75715989c1dac46e18870c2dcf3621e71bba8ecb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436199479773/957257d0-e8c4-4b9b-9e7d-955212e27a4b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"European and Iranian tourists visit the 2,500-year-old Tachara palace at Persepolis in Iran.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European and Iranian tourists visit the 2,500-year-old Tachara palace at Persepolis in Iran.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the same time, I went on, as Iran and the US edged together, Shia, Persian-speaking Iran and its Sunni, Arabic-speaking rival, Saudi Arabia, were engaged in struggles through their regional clients for influence over Yemen, Syria and Iraq. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/isis\" title=\"\">Islamic State</a> had been able to exploit the authority vacuum that had ensued. Although Isis was undoubtedly an anti-western organisation, it was animated above all by hatred of fellow Muslims – the Shia Muslims it regards as heretics. “So,” I went on, “the defeat of Isis is probably even more important for Iran than it is for the west.”</p> \n<p>Finally (as the griffin-capped columns of Persepolis came stupendously into view), I described Iran’s current, liberalising president, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/hassan-rouhani\" title=\"\">Hassan Rouhani</a>, and his determination to turn the isolated, resource-squandering oligarchy he had inherited from his predecessor, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/mahmoud-ahmadinejad\" title=\"\">Mahmoud Ahmadinejad</a>, into a diversified regional producer and trade hub. The president’s goal, I said, was not only to increase oil sales after the lifting of sanctions, but also to attract foreign investment on an unprecedented scale. This would affect the culture and even the appearance of the country.</p> \n<p>“Who knows?” I concluded, “Next time you’re here, there could be a McDonald’s on every corner.”</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>After Persepolis, we had an early night</strong> before heading east the following day towards Kerman, when I squeezed in next to Hossein in the prime position he monopolised as official guide, sprawled over two seats directly behind the driver.</p> \n<p>Hossein showed none of the wariness that I associate with Iranian men when first meeting them. He was, he told me, a former weightlifter who had given up the sport after injury; since then, as he cheerfully admitted, he had run spectacularly to fat. Now he was an expert witness on matters relating to tourism. He took Iranian holidaymakers to the Caucasus and had commercial interests in Scandinavia. His phone was full of numbers – he knew, or claimed to know, everyone. And when he wasn’t talking, or snoozing, or demolishing a box of traditional Iranian biscuits, he was taking notes on whatever was going on around him, which he filed away into his computer bag.</p> \n<p>It was part of Hossein’s job spec to keep us supplied with ordinary Iranians, and shortly afterwards Ed asked if we could get into the next village to meet some. Almost immediately we saw a breeze-block settlement running parallel to the road and swung off to enter it. “We’ve got a bunch of foreigners who want a cup of tea,” Hossein said to the first group of men we came across in what passed for the main street. “Will you oblige?” After a few minutes’ consultation, the men informed us that we would be received in the <em>Hosseinieh</em>, a devotional meeting hall that was ornamented with pictures of the supreme leader, carpeted with Chinese knock-offs, and locked.</p> \n<p>There was a problem. The key to the Hosseinieh could not be found. Not to worry; one of the men broke the window, put his hand in and slipped the latch. Shoes off, we rocked awkwardly on our haunches while the 15 or so men who had escorted us to the Hosseinieh dispersed to gather glasses, thermoses of tea and sugar lumps. They returned with the government-appointed headman.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/02/iranians-celebrate-nuclear-deal-tehran\">Iranians celebrate nuclear deal: 'This will bring hope to our life'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He was a taut, handsome, suspicious man<strong> </strong>who delivered himself of the usual declaration of self-abasement (“your heel is on my eye”), before denouncing the sanctions that our respective countries had inflicted on Iran. What, he would like to know, did we think of these sanctions? His pen hovered over his pad as I translated.</p> \n<p>He needn’t have worried. The small number of western tourists who visit Iran every year have already weathered their friends’ disapproval; by setting foot in the Islamic Republic they are showing their scepticism of the prevailing image of Iran as a regional troublemaker, while it is Israel, Pakistan and India that possess nuclear weapons and Saudi Arabia that exports the world’s most intolerant form of Islam.</p> \n<p>“Unfair!” pronounced Muriel the former flight attendant, and others murmured agreement; our host lowered his pen and spoke freely about the chronic water shortages that are ruining this formerly fecund part of Iran. These woes have nothing to do with sanctions, but rather a combination of lamentable water management and climate change. Even vegetables can no longer be grown locally but must be purchased from travelling salesmen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Just by visiting Iran, the tourists are showing their scepticism of its prevailing image as a regional troublemaker</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Unknown to us, as we chatted away inside the Hosseinieh, news of our arrival had spread around the village, and after we had finished our tea, the women of the village turned up. They slipped off their rubber shoes and came in, the older ones with the ends of their chadors clamped in their mouths, the younger ones more brazen and curious, looking at us through their black polyester <em>maghnaehs</em>, which neatly frame the face like a porthole.</p> \n<p>With the Iranian women arrived, the atmosphere in the Hosseinieh properly lightened. The women in our party gravitated towards their Iranian sisters and – without my help, without the laborious interventions of a translator – through an instinctive and unmediated synergy, eyes sparkling, hands reaching for hands, bonds of affection formed.</p> \n<p>“Aus-tra-lia,” sang Muriel, making it sound like an exotic flower, and there was a general cooing and bandying of benign phrases: “How wonderful,” “What a pretty daughter you have!” and “How about a picture?”</p> \n<p>My services as an interpreter were only required when the old women of the village, who learned that Katryn had been a doctor, besieged her for a consultation. “Bad leg!” they grinned, clutching capacious, rustling sides. “Backache!” “High blood sugar!” Katryn tactfully prescribed remedies that were both accessible and inexpensive: icepacks; celery tea; camomile. “And cut down on the red meat!”</p> \n<p>When it was time to go, we spilled out of the Hosseinieh like revellers from a pub. A police car had turned up to see what all the fuss was about. Hossein calmed the cops’ fears of sedition. We got back on the coach and rejoined the Kerman road. I asked Muriel what would happen if a dozen foreign tourists pitched up at a homestead in Australia.</p> \n<p>“They’d come away with lead in their buttocks,” replied the minister’s widow.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Over the next few days we drove</strong> thousands of kilometres, winding from Shiraz through the central provinces of this jagged, khaki land, and, since my travelling in Iran has always been done in the company of Iranians, this was the first time I saw the country as a foreigner does. The experience was far from liberating – on the contrary, it sometimes felt as though our progress was structured around toilet stops – but it revealed to me new lines on a face I had long known.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"49c30dcfa1bf4723ad5d6913fbdce3b9238aef67\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436199584641/0bb8e67e-0eb8-43f9-94ef-80b3c559e29f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tourists visit the tomb of Persian mystic poet Hafez in Shiraz.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourists visit the tomb of Persian mystic poet Hafez in Shiraz.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sometimes when we were driving I would go and sit up near the driver, Mr Aghai, and his youthful assistant, Ali-Reza. Mr Aghai was an old timer, and he drove uncomplainingly even with a blinding sun in his face. Ali-Reza, on the other hand, did not conceal his unhappiness at being a dogsbody. He had benefitted from the home-building subsidies that Ahmadinejad had made available in the early years of the decade, and had earned good money making armatures for houses. Rouhani stopped the handouts; Ali-Reza lost his job. His new work in tourism was taking away from his infant son and exposing him to unsettling hierarchies.</p> \n<p>One relationship particularly vexed Ali-Reza: Hossein, perched in the coach’s front row, clearly enjoyed teasing, lecturing and embarrassing the younger man. I intervened in these exchanges from time to time, always with levity, but aware that I was coming between a bully and his prey.</p> \n<p>Hossein was one of those Iranians who sensed the good times coming. Between snoozes he proposed that we go into business together. We met another in an oasis town we visited, drinking tea on daybeds in a merchant’s mansion that had been converted into a hotel. Its owner told us that he had 12 more tourism projects that were good to go – as soon as he found foreign backing. He had survived the past few years on Chinese and domestic custom; now he wanted Europeans and Americans.</p> \n<p>A few miles west of the city of Bam, whose famous date palms survived the earthquake that destroyed the mud-brick citadel there in 2003, we were admitted to a special economic zone in an expanse of reclaimed desert, where we gained a sense of the desolation wreaked by sanctions – and the country’s potential for liftoff.</p> \n<p>The zone had been designed for 50,000 workers and their families, but Ahmadinejad and isolation had scared away investors, and the lots were mainly empty. We drove around for a while, up and down the deserted grid of streets, before visiting one of the few productive units in the place: a car factory that was knocking out overpriced Chinese SUVs for the domestic market.</p> \n<p>A nearby Volkswagen plant lay silent. The juxtaposition seemed to sum up the Iranians’ reluctant dependence on Chinese technology and investment, and their keenness to entice back the westerners as soon as politics allows.</p> \n<p>“Ahmadinejad was in power for eight years,” a local official told us, “and he took us back 80.” We were drinking fruit juice&nbsp;and looking at an artificial lake populated by a flock of unoccupied pedal boats in the shape of swans. It took some effort to imagine this place full of workers and their families, the swans chugging, the schools full, the nearby train station and international airport busy with traffic. But this is what will&nbsp;happen here and elsewhere in Iran once investment enters what emerging market analysts are calling the “final frontier” – the only substantial market that has yet to fall to global capitalism. The official reported a surge of inquiries from foreign companies considering an investment in the special economic zone.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2014/may/23/tourism-iran-off-the-beaten-track-hormozgan\">A Londoner in Iran, off the beaten track</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Muriel said: “About 25 years ago I visited some muddy fields being dug up in China. Those fields are now a city of 15 million people: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2014/jun/13/inside-shenzen-china-silicon-valley-tech-nirvana-pearl-river\" title=\"\">Shenzhen</a>.” Someone else spoke of Indonesia, another of Turkey. “And once sanctions come off,” said Chris the oil-field troubleshooter, “it will be impossible to put them back. After the consensus is gone you can’t build it again.”</p> \n<p>Often, as we drove along the well-maintained roads, I was&nbsp;handed the microphone to speak about some aspect of Iranian history or politics, or the experience of living in Iran. I fielded questions on everything from Iran’s mineral riches (vast and still barely tapped) to the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980s, an eight-year trauma that killed half a million Iranians and lives on in the country’s prickly, distrustful foreign relations.</p> \n<p>Attitudes towards the hijab evolved in opposing directions. At one of the mosques we visited, Tina the former social worker lost her battle with a billowing, floral-patterned chador she had been required to wear, and was engulfed. “I’m resigned,” she was heard murmuring somewhere in the maelstrom, “to looking like shit.” Muriel, by contrast, insisted that I accompany her to a bazaar to buy a black chador with an embroidered hem. Returning to the coach, she made one of the theatrical entrances at which, I sensed, she has always excelled.</p> \n<p>In the prosperous desert trading city of Yazd, we had the impression of a country going in different directions at the same time. We spent the morning at the city’s principal <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2002/oct/30/religion.uk20\" title=\"\">Zoroastrian</a> temple, one of a few places of worship open to the 30,000-strong community that is all that remains of pre-Islamic Iran. The priest told us that the fire he feeds mulberry and walnut logs had been been burning continuously for hundreds of years.</p> \n<p>“And what happens if it goes out?” someone asked. “Nothing,” the priest replied laconically. “Except that the endeavours, toil and devotion of our forefathers will have come to nought.”</p> \n<p>Yazd is a famously conservative place, dry and mercantile, so it came as a surprise that it also boasts one of the most self-consciously western restaurants I have seen in Iran – a softly lit establishment decked out with plush furnishings that had been imported in spite of sanctions. (Although it is not illegal to sell non-sanctioned goods, such as furniture, to Iran, in practice it is difficult because bank transfers are impossible and the collapse of the Iranian rial has made imports exponentially more expensive.)</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Most of the people we spoke to in Yazd and elsewhere expressed an affinity for the west and a desire to know it better</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Several of us had mushroom soup (in the desert!), served in a bread bowl, made according to an eastern European recipe, and our lunch was punctuated by the sound of corks being pulled from bottles of non-alcoholic champagne (in fact, carbonated grape juice) that was being quaffed, with a kind of simulated drunken hilarity, by slim and impeccably made up young women in highly coloured headscarves – the daughters of the conservative Yazdis.</p> \n<p>That such a restaurant has thrived under sanctions lends credence to the common Iranian gripe that the sanctions have hit ordinary people painfully, while anyone with connections has been able to make enormous sums operating in a closed, illiberal business environment. It stands to reason that these people, under cover of ideology, should oppose the deal being worked out with the west.</p> \n<p>On the whole, though, most of the people we spoke to in Yazd and elsewhere expressed an affinity for the west and a desire to know it better. For anyone who spends time in other countries in the Middle East, where the US and its allies are generally loathed, this exceptional attitude substantiates the idea that Iran could, over time, not only make peace with the US, but find itself in a de facto partnership with its former enemy. (The fight against Isis is the obvious place to start, even if some Iranians believe, somewhat eccentrically, in an American hand behind Isis’s creation.)</p> \n<h2>* * * </h2> \n<p><strong>Sitting on my bed after we got back </strong>to the hotel that evening, I reflected that after a decade and a half of involvement with a pariah state, I would soon witness Iran’s readmission to the international community. It’s a moment I have longed for – I have an Iranian wife and two half-Iranian children – and yet I found it impossible to rejoice without reservation, because this readmission will have a telling effect on the country’s greatest resource: its culture.</p> \n<p>Iran will now join the ranks of the insipid elsewhere, and I sensed it already from my room in Yazd, whose layout, specifications (minibar size; disposition of plug sockets) and dark-stain trim derived from an instantly familiar rule book of international standards. There was something chilling about a hotel room you could get around in the dark because it was the same as every other hotel room. I fled downstairs.</p> \n<p>It was 7pm. The others were seated around a long table, pining for the booze that cannot be bought legally in the country. One or two had ordered cans of&nbsp;fruit-flavoured malt drink and were scanning them for non-existent alcohol content. Ryan the internet millionaire was explaining how he was trying to engineer a fans’ buyout of his beloved Leeds United, while Charlotte the Aussie teacher bemoaned the ordeal of the hijab. “Just wait till we institute scarf-on-the-other-head day,” she growled in my direction, as if I was responsible for the fact that she had to go about the place with her head covered up. Hossein arrived to read from a menu of kebabs and other proteins. “What’s the vegetarian option?” someone asked drily.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfa02e91c9aa0dcbbc3f69d1cebd7ebca33e3e47\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436200337530/e93eb000-fbd0-445a-a5f9-68bc3575df2d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Amir Chakhmagh mosque in Yazd, Iran.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Amir Chakhmagh mosque in Yazd, Iran.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Keren Su/China Span/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While we waited for our food, Ed asked everyone to describe their impressions of the country. “In what ways has Iran matched your expectations?”</p> \n<p>It turned out that it hadn’t matched them at all. “I was expecting a place that had obviously been hammered by sanctions,” said Graham, the former telecoms executive, “somewhere obviously down on its luck. But even in the small towns the streets are tidy and cared for. You see patches of garden. The people carry themselves with a kind of pride.”</p> \n<p>Several members of the group had anticipated a police state. “If this was Pakistan or Saudi,” said Henry the hedge-fund man, “there’d be military on every corner. But I’ve hardly seen anyone in uniform. We’ve been going around the place talking with people unhindered. I’m surprised at how relaxed it all seems from a security point of view.”</p> \n<p>I raised a hand. It seemed worth pointing out that the security forces here did not always declare themselves. “Before we get carried away,” Ed interjected, “we shouldn’t forget that Iran carries out more executions than any country except China, and that the only way you can find out about this inside the country is to use a proxy server to get past internet censorship.”</p> \n<p>For all the country’s human rights abuses, however, everyone agreed that the gap between perception and reality was startling. “Iran,” I agreed, “is friendlier, better-run and freer than most westerners are led to believe. Also, what the west calls Iran’s ‘aggressive behaviour’ might be better understood as Iran looking after its interests – which naturally don’t always coincide with those of the west.”</p> \n<p>The group seemed to like these ideas. They confirmed the wisdom of travelling – of seeing with one’s own eyes what others distorted. A corollary was that what they were being told at home was not the truth, and for all their awareness of the vested interests that control the TV and press, and the difficulty of getting reliable information even in an age of unregulated social media, this thought troubled them.</p> \n<p>Henry flourished the most recent issue of the Economist, which described Iran as “<a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647973-promise-and-dangers-negotiating-deal-irans-mullahs-nuclear-test-obama\" title=\"\">the fist that most threatens the world</a>”. To the people around the table, it seemed preposterous that the stimulating and welcoming country in which they had spent the past week could be characterised so unthinkingly. Henry and the other Americans around the table attributed the flood of misinformation in their country to the power of Israel, the rise of an undiscerning Islamophobia, and the replacement in US public discourse of calm analysis by the politics of the gut. Not that these ailments are a monopoly of the US, as Ed pointed out. “Where we are sitting now is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/iran\" title=\"\">considered by the Foreign Office</a> to be as dangerous as Baghdad.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/gallery/2013/oct/18/iran-top-10-tourist-destinations-in-pictures\">Iran's top 10 tourist destinations – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A sense of satisfaction pervaded the group that night. The&nbsp;tourists liked Iran and felt they understood it. But this feeling&nbsp;did not survive the second half of the tour.</p> \n<p>The first problem was that Ed and Katryn’s idea of political and economic tourism had never really been accepted by the Iranian travel company they had partnered with, which had also supplied us with Hossein. With the exception of the car factory at Bam, almost all the interesting meetings that had been promised – with government officials, academics and the like – did not materialise.</p> \n<p>Ed and Katryn wanted to improvise replacement activities, but Hossein resisted, saying this would get him into trouble. His preference was to guide us&nbsp;from attraction to attraction, and if possible from restaurant to restaurant, skimming commissions as he went. The fact was, as we foreigners had gradually come to realise, that Hossein was more than just a “character”, roaring with laughter at his own jokes and spraying tips around on Ed and Katryn’s account. He was our minder, photographing everything we did and taking down the names of ordinary Iranians we spoke to.</p> \n<p>In our next destination, the historic city of Isfahan, where arrangements had been made for us to have dinner with an Iranian family, he ate copiously from the exquisitely astringent herb-and-bean stew that our hostess had prepared before making his way around the room&nbsp;and taking photos of the family mementoes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>A sense of satisfaction descended. The tourists liked Iran and felt they understood it. But that feeling didn't last</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>That night, I went down to the river, breathed in the daphne and mayblossom and watched the Isfahanis move like a shadow play between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khaju_Bridge\" title=\"\">the illuminated arches</a> of the bridges that Shah Abbas the Great built 400 years ago. Then I sat on the bank and counted the days that were left.</p> \n<p>The following morning, we went up to the ridge of mountains that bounds the city in order to visit the war cemetery, <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/zongo/1732761196/\" title=\"\">the Rose Garden of the Martyrs</a>, which holds thousands of graves, each surmounted by a photo of the martyr in&nbsp;a metal frame. We wandered about self-consciously. Our respective countries had all supported Saddam in his war with Iran, and&nbsp;in a way we all felt culpable.</p> \n<p>It was a Friday and the cemetery was full of families visiting the graves of fallen sons, having picnics and reciting the Qur’anic prayer for the dead. But the people did not look askance at our odd little group, as I feared. One female student told us how young women had gone to the front as nurses and sought out disfigured veterans to marry.</p> \n<p>An old man came up to me and said how pleased he was to see us; he smiled radiantly, but then his eyes reddened and he clutched his ribs – his son lay a few yards away. “Tell them what their countries did to us,” he wept. “Tell them.” Muriel wiped her eyes and said, “It’s good that we came; it’s important to show what we feel.”</p> \n<p>The war had demonstrated to Iran how alone it was – spurned by the west, spurned by the Arabs. The non-Persian, non-Shia world couldn’t be trusted. Self-reliance was the watchword in military and economic affairs, underpinned by an ideological autonomy that derived from Shia Islam.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fab9872b528c2ef010586327feef3e9e271167e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436206487525/6038f1ab-8eaa-4790-902c-0f6bfec980ff-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"German tourists visit the tomb of Darius I the Great near Persepolis in Iran.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">German tourists visit the tomb of Darius I the Great near Persepolis in Iran.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>From Isfahan we went to Qom, one&nbsp;of&nbsp;the holiest places in Shia Islam, on the edge of the vast salt flats of central Iran. I once wrote a book that meant I had to come to Qom a lot, and it always made me feel thirsty.</p> \n<p>In Qom we visited a private university that specialised in comparative religious studies. The books in the well-stocked library testified to an eclectic curriculum – Engels was there, as well as nihilism and even Israel – but one got the sense that the students were learning about alien values not as westerners might, as an exercise in multicultural toleration, but in order to understand what they were up against.</p> \n<p>We filed into a classroom that contained about 15 students, the majority of them young women wearing&nbsp;<em>maghnaehs</em>. A male teacher was&nbsp;addressing them on the origins of Shiism – he was using foundation texts to refute claims by hardline Sunnis that the Shias are a heretic sect and should be considered apostates. “On the contrary,” the teacher told us, “the texts&nbsp;demonstrate that Shia tenets are&nbsp;integral to Islam.”</p> \n<p>Ed asked the girls about the real-world applications of what&nbsp;they were being taught. They looked at us blankly and I&nbsp;tried to explain. Then they told us with infinite patience that&nbsp;they were not there to improve their job prospects. Indeed, the majority were married, many to seminarians, and I suspected that their husbands would prefer it if they did not go to work.</p> \n<p>“We want to defend our faith,” one of them said, “against the stratagems that have been devised against it.” That meant Isis. It meant us. It meant anyone with hostile designs on Iran and Shiism.</p> \n<p>Our visit ended with Ed expressing his hope that everyone there would have the chance to visit Britain. “I would be very happy to come to Britain and proselytise,” one of the girls replied, and&nbsp;we all laughed uneasily.</p> \n<h2>* * * </h2> \n<p><strong>“For the last two days of the tour</strong> we spend time looking at Iran’s system of government, its media, economy and relations with its neighbours. We explore the history of the Iranian revolution, tour the main government areas, visit a newspaper and meet with locals young and old for a diverse view of life in the city.”</p> \n<p>So ran Ed and Katryn’s schedule for Tehran, the country’s polluted, impossible, disputatious capital, where I lived for seven years – loving the experience but getting less and less of it as the city slowed under the deadweight of mismanagement, political controversy and the fear of Israeli or US attack.</p> \n<p>The Iranian travel agency had arranged just one meeting for us in Tehran, with the head of a government-owned media company. To supplement this meagre itinerary, I had arranged appointments with a banker, an equity portfolio manager and the founder of an&nbsp;internet retail group. In between, we would ride the <a href=\"http://metro.tehran.ir/Default.aspx?tabid=120\" title=\"\">Tehran Metro</a> and visit coffee shops, parks, galleries and restaurants. We would get a feel for the most stimulating city in the Middle East.</p> \n<p>But now, on our penultimate morning in Iran, as we waited for our meeting at the media company, we were nobbled by the representative of the Iranian travel agency, the pretty, fretful Ms Akhundi. She informed us that changed circumstances had rendered the programme I had devised impossible. “Should you insist on going ahead,” she said, “our own licence may be revoked.”</p> \n<p>“What about the Metro?” I asked. “Surely there’s no problem with that?”</p> \n<p>She shook her head. “Not even the Metro.”</p> \n<p>Ed’s eyes narrowed. “I have a tour to conclude,” he said. “These people have taken time off from their busy lives to see Iran.” He scanned the room for corroboration, and his eye fell on Henry. “One of our clients runs a hedge fund that is worth not one billion” – he paused dramatically – “but TWO billion dollars.” Akhundi smiled weakly. “You see,” she whispered, “there are certain sensitivities&nbsp;…&nbsp;”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/03/iranian-foreign-minister-raises-prospect-of-joint-action-against-islamic-state\">Iranian foreign minister raises prospect of joint action against Islamic State</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hossein sidled up to me looking thunderstruck. “For God’s sake,” he said, “they just called me and said they would withdraw my work permit if this goes on.” In all his years in tourism he could only remember two tours that had been more stressful. On one of them, some foreigners had been kidnapped and there had been a gunfight on the roof of the hotel; on the other, the tour bus had been stoned.</p> \n<p>Ed, Katryn and I conferred. We had no choice but to comply with orders that evidently came from the security agencies.</p> \n<p>I smiled secretly as the tourists milled about talking about what had happened. Five days earlier they had felt as though they had a handle on the country, but now they were lost again, their room for manoeuvre inexplicably shrunken from the whole of the Persian plateau to a single room.</p> \n<p>“The trouble is,” said Ed, “that if something doesn’t work in this country, you’ve no idea why.” Tina nodded. “Everything is just so ambiguous.” It was no less than I felt after 15 years.</p> \n<p>“At least,” said Ed, looking around him, “we should try and extract something of value from this place.”</p> \n<p>Our meeting with the head of the media company began. He was a slight, elderly cleric, and as a young man he had been a trusted associate of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/feb/09/remembering-khomeini-36-years-after-iranian-revolution\" title=\"\">Ayatollah Khomeini</a>. He replied patiently to questions about relations with the US (they could be mended) and Israel (he drew a distinction between the “reality” of Israel and its moral “right” to exist – Iran, he seemed to be saying, could accept the first but not the second).</p> \n<p>More than the content of the cleric’s answers, however, it was his manner that left a mark on the group: modest, authoritative and quixotically humorous. Ryan was impressed by his answer to a question about happiness: “If you are fighting with your destiny and are unhappy with your lot, you will never be happy.”</p> \n<p>“I could imagine worse people as prime minister of my country,” said the man from Huddersfield.</p> \n<p>After a tour of the editorial offices – which wore the smug, lethargic aspect of a well-funded government enterprise – we were invited to stay for lunch. This&nbsp;will kill some time, I thought, as&nbsp;we&nbsp;entered the company’s formal entertaining area, when suddenly our host the cleric returned, this time with&nbsp;his daughter and various senior employees, and bade us sit down.</p> \n<p>The cleric insisted on giving out our soup, slopping it into each bowl as he made his way around the table. “He serves the lowliest employee,” said the executive sitting on my left. “It’s his way of showing that he’s a father to us all.” To my right sat our host’s daughter, a&nbsp;woman in a patterned chador who made her way methodically through the&nbsp;breaded fish and rice.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/gallery/2015/apr/15/instagram-shapshots-annette-widitz-in-iran\">Instagram shapshots: Annette Widitz in Iran</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was now clear that, in the view of our host, the serious part of the day was over and it was time to enjoy ourselves. There was much hilarity at his end of the table; I noticed that Katryn’s hijab had slipped off and no one seemed to mind. In a gap between courses, the cleric prepared an orange by unpeeling four petals of equal size from the apex and tucking them under a disc of peel that remained attached to the base. He rose and presented his handiwork to Henry, who compared it to a mushroom cloud. The cleric laughed and replied, “You foreigners see a nuclear explosion where we see a lotus flower.”</p> \n<p>At the end of lunch, two small bowls of jelly remained in front of each setting. One was red, the other green. Iranians love jelly, but the main courses had filled me up and I intended to leave mine. Then I felt the cleric’s presence at my side, and his hand reached to pick up my spoon. “You must have some jelly,” he said, and he brought a heaped spoonful up to my mouth. I opened my mouth and swallowed. By now the rest&nbsp;of the table had noticed what was going on. A mullah force-feeding an Englishman in central Tehran!</p> \n<p>The spectacle did not stop there. On went our host, around the table – this senior figure in a revolutionary state that George W Bush put in his “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2003/jan/28/usa.iran\" title=\"\">axis of evil</a>” – feeding each male guest several spoonfuls, urging us, “Eat up! Let no one&nbsp;say we did not feed you properly in Iran!” He encouraged his daughter to do the same for the female guests. The cameras were out now; each gulp was greeted with flashes and hoots of laughter. “Just wait&nbsp;till I tell my Republican friends in&nbsp;California!” Graham exclaimed.</p> \n<p>On went the twinkling, Chaucerian mullah, until he came to Hossein – his final victim. Hossein grinned. He giggled. He&nbsp;was flirting. Then he threw back his&nbsp;massive, bald rugby ball of&nbsp;a&nbsp;head and opened his mouth. The cleric peered into the great orifice. “This isn’t a mouth,” he exclaimed. “This&nbsp;is a&nbsp;cave!”</p> \n<p>The spoon went in.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Follow the Long Read on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread. </a></p> \n<p><em>Some names have been changed.</em></p>","section":"News","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436199115120/0e9472d7-d61b-47c9-81fa-b25982fb7e1a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty","altText":"German tourists visit the tomb of Darius I the Great near Persepolis in Iran.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Behrouz Mehri/AFP/Getty"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436199481074/957257d0-e8c4-4b9b-9e7d-955212e27a4b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"European and Iranian tourists visit the 2,500-year-old Tachara palace at Persepolis in Iran.

A quick check of <a href=\"http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/pensions/article-1633402/Pension-pot-calculator-How-need-save-retirement.html\">any pension calculator</a> shows that is woefully short, and most people will need well over &pound;300,000 (taking receipt of the state pension into account).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/datablog/2015/jul/07/personal-finance-knowledge-house-prices-pensions-student-loans\">The price is wrong: survey exposes lack of personal finance knowledge in UK</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And these averages mask many who are much further out. Three in 10 people think that to get a total annual income of &pound;25,000 they need less than &pound;50,000 in their pension pot - which would actually provide well under &pound;10,000.</p> \n<p>And one of the most worrying findings from the study is that we think under-saving for retirement is a very widespread norm: we think two-thirds of people are saving too little, when <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/223015/inadequate_retirement_incomes_july2012.pdf\">government estimates</a> suggest only 43% of us are. This is important, as we know our perception of what is “normal” is a powerful influence on our own behaviour.</p> \n<p>The purpose of the poll is not just to raise a wry smile at our collective ignorance. This matters: <a href=\"https://53b86a9de6dd4673612f-c36ff983a9cc042683f46b699207946d.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/research_feb11_cr03.pdf\">studies</a> show that low financial capability has the equivalent effect on life satisfaction to being unemployed if you’re a man and to divorce if you’re a woman. </p> \n<p>And it’s an issue that will only grow in importance as more aspects of financial support are de-institutionalised. For example, the burden of calculation and risk for final salary pensions sat very much with employers – but as these schemes close, this burden shifts to individuals with the onus now on them to work out what they need. </p> \n<p>So the necessity for better financial decision making is clear. There are two broad approaches to helping people with this: directly teaching us more to increase our knowledge, and making it easier to get to the right decisions by changing what is offered to us and how. </p> \n<p>On the first of these, there is a clear benefit to increasing our financial knowledge. Studies show the straightforward sequence – greater knowledge leads to better planning, which in turn leads to better outcomes. In <a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w17107\">one study</a>, getting one additional financial literacy question correct is associated with a higher probability of planning for retirement, while those who planned saved three times as much as those who didn’t. </p> \n<p>And some moves are under way to help increase our financial skills and knowledge – in particular, financial literacy was made a mandatory element of the national curriculum for the first time in this school year. This is an important step, as we need to start much younger and normalise financial education. But it is largely symbolic – <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21571883-financial-education-has-had-disappointing-results-past-teacher-leave-them\">studies suggest school-based financial training has limited impact on its own</a>, not least because it is hard to make the content current and relevant when the big decisions will come later in life. </p> \n<p>Much more effective is more tailored and targeted interventions, such as a nine-month scheme for social housing tenants run by Citizens Advice trainers, which saw <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/media-library/sites/geography/migrated/documents/pfrc1207.pdf\">impressive results</a> in increasing saving levels and broader financial resilience.</p> \n<p>It is worth saying that these challenges are much more acute for the less well-off. There is now a <a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/scarcity-why-having-too-little-means-so-much-by-sendhil-mullainathan-and-eldar-shafir/2007116.article\">compelling body of work</a> that shows the poor stay poor not because of any inherent personal deficiency – instead cause and effect works the other way round: once someone is poor, the constant worry impacts on a number of other aspects of life, which leads to worse decisions. As academics would say, poverty constrains their “<a href=\"https://inequalitiesblog.wordpress.com/2013/10/10/the-psychology-of-poverty-and-welfare-reform/\">cognitive bandwith</a>”.</p> \n<p>But this sort of tailored training is expensive, and will not reach al, so we also need to find smarter ways to intervene when decisions are actually being made – an approach that the financial services industry itself can play a key part in. For example, when time is scarce and attention limited, very simple actions can change behaviours: <a href=\"http://karlan.yale.edu/p/Top%20of%20Mind%202011jan.pdf\">an experiment</a> in Peru, Bolivia and the Philippines showed that customers who received a reminder text message from their bank to encourage deposits saved significantly more than those who did not.</p> \n<p>Our ignorance of the financial facts of life highlights a growing practical challenge to good decision making and important outcomes for people. We need help, but this cannot be just in the classroom, it needs to work with the grain of our actual behaviour and use all opportunities to help us make better financial choices.</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436184906404/850c11bd-248c-4aed-ab21-3ef9e1679207-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tetra

On the eve of a show at the Manchester international festival, the self-styled ‘Zen artist’ takes us around some favourite haunts<br /></p>","byline":"Simon Hattenstone","body":"<p>Tim Burgess rolls up with his toddler Morgan, a pushchair and a plan. We’re going on a tour of Manchester’s town centre – “droplifting” tickets for the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/charlatans\">Charlatans</a> gig taking place that night. For the uninitiated, droplifting is the opposite of shoplifting: instead of stealing stuff, you leave a gift. Manchester’s radical spirit lives on.</p> \n<p>This is very much Burgess’s Manchester: record shops, music venues, bars with legendary jukeboxes, coffee shops where bands played live. It’s a world that pretty much starts and ends with music. We’re also here to celebrate the biennial <a href=\"http://www.mif.co.uk/\">Manchester international festival</a>, but it becomes apparent the Charlatans frontman is primarily interested in a certain fringe event he has a hand in.</p> \n<p>First stop is <a href=\"http://www.thekoffeepot.co.uk/\">the Koffee Pot</a>, a cafe in the northern quarter famous for fry-ups that cure hangovers. Burgess orders a fizzy water (everything in moderation these days) and explains why the Koffee Pot is representative of Manchester for him: like the city, it has tarted itself up, but is still somehow the same. Bands coming into the city would often make the Koffee Pot their first port of call, and might well do an impromptu gig here.</p> \n<p>Burgess was born in neighbouring city Salford, then grew up in the Cheshire town of Northwich. As a teenage punk, he would come into Manchester on the train to mooch around in record shops and see gigs. “Manchester was this beautiful city, 20 miles away,” he says. “All my friends would come here and we’d hide all our money in our Doc Marten boots.” Back then, he says, Manchester was more forbidding. The Arndale Centre had been built in the hope of transforming city centre business. Instead, it just attracted kids wagging school and out for a scrap. “The Arndale was pretty threatening. That’s why we used to hide our money in our boots.”</p> \n<p>Burgess and his friends were known as the Northwich punks. He seems so gentle, I can’t really imagine him as a hardcase. “Well, I thought I looked pretty tough, but photographs suggest I was just a kid with short hair and Doc Martens. You’d walk through Manchester with clenched fists ready to punch people. The most violent time was the 70s, wasn’t it?” The clenched fists were more defensive than aggressive, he says – they were always waiting to be jumped.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"036b044e9e86c48d54983ea04623787eb09c1996\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436197928908/311a92fa-912f-4ac9-858a-fa020818414d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony Wilson in 1992\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Wilson in 1992.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ged Murray/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Burgess places two tickets for the gig on our table, then photographs and tweets them. </p> \n<p>It was journalist/impresario <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/tonywilson\">Tony Wilson</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/neworder\">New Order</a> who changed his life, he says. Wilson, who started Factory Records, showed him Manchester could lead, not just follow, while New Order reinvented pop. “They just made records that nobody else has made. It was a new kind of rock’n’roll and I don’t even know if they knew that.”</p> \n<p>Morgan, who has the same moptop as Burgess and is wearing purple shades, is placed in his buggy, and we prepare to leave. A man in his mid-30s with dyed black hair and a Flying Burrito Brothers T-shirt runs into the cafe in a furious sweat. “Is there a ticket still here?” the man, Mark Liptrott, asks. “I just got off the bus with my wife and I saw the tweet and I thought: ‘I’ve got to leg it.’ Fifteen minutes I’ve been running.” There is no sign of his wife.</p> \n<p>How many times has he seen the Charlatans? “Maybe 50.” Liptrott gives Burgess a damp hug. Does it make Burgess feel good that a fan is willing to go to such lengths to see a concert? “Well, it’s nice that he got the tickets,” Burgess says quietly.</p> \n<p>It is 26 years, 17 top 30 singles and eight top 10 albums since the Charlatans formed. They came out of the Madchester baggy movement of the 80s, influenced by the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/stone-roses\">Stone Roses</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/happy-mondays\">Happy Mondays</a> as well as the 60s psychedelia of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/pinkfloyd\">Pink Floyd</a>. While the Roses and Mondays were the more acclaimed, both bands split up quickly and now it is the Charlatans who have arguably the more impressive back catalogue. Their sound has always been distinctive, defined by a swirling Hammond organ and Burgess’s nasal whine (which might just have given <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/liam-gallagher\">Liam Gallagher</a> an idea).</p> \n<p>They became known as the Charlies, which was an appropriate nickname. If ever there was an advert for alcoholic excess and having cocaine blown up your bottom by fellow band members (as he revealed in his autobiography, Telling Stories), it would have to be Burgess. When the Charlatans emerged in 1989, he looked like the love child of Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Today, despite the peroxide hair and scholarly specs, he still does. His face unlined, his character unassuming; he looks as if he’s about to enter sixth form.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68d42795725649fd2a27db579f6ad4c8bd4b692a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436198006502/6ced96eb-6c7d-45bb-b3d6-db8e13b059f0-293x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tim Burgess on Later with Jools Holland in 1997\" width=\"293\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Burgess on Later with Jools Holland in 1997.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andre Csillag/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The drink and drugs have been replaced by transcendental meditation. As we stroll down Oldham Street, I notice a tattoo on his wrist. “A Charlatan I, noble and wild,” it says – lyrics from the song Blackened Blue Eyes. “It’s a reminder of 2006, a big year for me. That’s when I gave up drinking. I knew it had to come to an end. I just wasn’t as good as I used to be – my singing, my shape, ideas. I don’t think I’ve changed at all really, but the filing system inside my brain got a lot easier.” Even now, there is a lovely mashed-up quality to Burgess. It might be the long-term effect of his indulgences, but I think it’s probably just his nature.</p> \n<p>We head down Market Street and memory lane. Burgess wasn’t interested in traditional culture as a boy. He had no time for the Whitworth art gallery, but he would often be down Whitworth Street to see gigs at the Ritz. And there was the Hacienda on Whitworth Street West, owned by Wilson and New Order. No point visiting there – it’s long been demolished and turned into Hacienda Apartments.</p> \n<p>What’s amazing about the Manchester international festival, I say, is that so many artists are branching out: pop stars doing ballet and opera, for example. “You’re talking about <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jul/06/damon-albarn-roskilde-carried-off-stage-following-five-hour-set-africa-express\">Damon Albarn</a>? There’s something not great about just being a rock star. I think it’s old hat. If someone says to me: ‘Oh, you’re a rock star,’ it reminds me of someone from Grease – like leather trousers and slicked back hair. It’s probably OK for someone who’s 16 years old …”</p> \n<p>Burgess has also branched out – not least with his own mini-festival, <a href=\"http://www.timpeaks.co.uk/\">Tim Peaks</a>. When I ask if it’s part of MIF, he looks appalled. No no no, he says, it’s not even the fringe, it’s the fringe of the fringe. Tim Peaks features friends of Burgess performing for free: this year, there is actor <a href=\"http://vivalifestyle.co.uk/paddy-considine-headlines-tim-peaks-diner-11-12-july/\">Paddy Considine</a> being interviewed by former Hacienda DJ and writer Dave Haslam; a band featuring the children of New Order’s Gillian Gilbert and Stephen Morris; and the Welsh-language band Yucatan, who also give Welsh-language classes. If Burgess thinks it is now inappropriate to call him a rock star, how would he describe himself? He pauses. “Zen artist.” He grins.</p> \n<p>Tim Peaks funds itself by flogging coffee at its pop-up coffee shop/venue. If they sell 1,000 cups, they make two grand, and most of that will go to the <a href=\"https://www.davidlynchfoundation.org/\">David Lynch Foundation</a>, a charity run by the film-maker that funds the teaching of transcendental meditation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"902ce53a77e8b2f7a4cb3367f557e3b36d908899\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436197537988/f1fa6b71-b6f3-4710-8842-2152adb3de0a-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tim Burgess next to the jukebox in Corbieres Wine Cavern\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burgess next to the jukebox in Corbieres Wine Cavern.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Outside Corbieres Wine Cavern, a bar Burgess used to frequent in the 80s, he looks uneasy. “I’ve not been here for a long time. I don’t drink, so there’s no point.” A sign outside says: “Home of the world’s greatest jukebox.” We walk down the steps. Alison by Elvis Costello is playing – and suddenly we’re back in 1977. “Nothing’s changed,” says Burgess. “We came here because all the other bars insisted on shirts and no trainers. I saw bands playing in the corner. I actually saw Mark Collins playing there, before he was in the Charlatans, in a band called the Waltones.” He walks towards the jukebox. The first thing he sees is the Charlatans compilation album, Melting Pot, with the track-listing handwritten. “That is amazing,” he says, with a mix of astonishment and embarrassment. He leaves two tickets on the jukebox, takes a photo and tweets them.</p> \n<p>The sun is burning down on us as we make our way towards Piccadilly Records, one of the country’s great vinyl shops. Is this an unusual Manchester day? No, he says, the rain and misery is a myth. “All my days as a teenager involved the sunshine. The clouds are low, that’s a fact, but it’s always wonderfully warm in Manchester.” Maybe he’s talking metaphorically.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"65fb618de0f1297cb7a486fc61b3c093ecc496d3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436197797848/a35d9c9a-0d73-447d-b441-42b1e0705b10-281x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Morrissey in 1983\" width=\"281\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Morrissey in 1983.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Sportsphoto Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What about the miserabilism of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/smiths\">the Smiths</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/joydivision\">Joy Division</a>, supposedly inspired by cold and dole? “Well, I don’t see the Smiths as being miserable either. I saw the Smiths as being very, very funny.” I start singing Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now. “Well, that’s still very funny,” he says, deadpan. Maybe his vision of Manchester explains the sunny romanticism of such songs as How High and One to Another. (“Love I adore you / Always lookin’ for you / And I’ll be there whenever you need me / Be my Spiderwoman I’ll be your Spiderman.”)</p> \n<p>Halfway down Market Street, Morgan is getting restless. We happen to pass by a street stall selling inflatable Spidermen. We buy him one for a fiver, which keeps him happy, while Burgess pops off to look for earplugs so Morgan can enjoy the gig without lasting damage.</p> \n<p>Across the road is the Royal Exchange, the beautiful theatre in the round that is staging Caryl Churchill’s rarely performed <a href=\"http://\">The Skriker</a>, with Maxine Peake, during MIF. I tell Burgess this was the country’s best theatre when I was growing up. “I don’t think I have ever been to the theatre,” he responds. “I just never really fancied it.” Actually, he remembers, he has been to the Exchange. “I went there to see Mark E Smith and the Fall.” Smith is another of his heroes because he still feels relevant. “That’s what I love about the Manchester bands we’ve talked about already – Smiths, Joy Division, the Fall. It’s a different kind of rock that doesn’t remind me of Grease.” And the Charlatans? “Yes, the Charlatans are definitely that, too. When we started, it wasn’t rock. It was more trancey. The idea was to transcend – to make music that, well, took you to another place.”</p> \n<p>At Piccadilly Records, we time-travel again, this time back to 1968. Here’s Led Zeppelin, there’s the Rolling Stones’ Beggars Banquet. Burgess caresses the sleeves lovingly. Then he finds the Charlatans’ latest album, Modern Nature, slips in a couple of tickets, photographs it and tweets. A couple of minutes later, another sweating thirtysomething runs into the shop. Greg Carty looks at me, beseechingly. “Just seen it on Twitter and legged it here,” he says. “Where is it, mate? I’ve been to the Koffee Pot and missed them. Then I went to Corbieres and just missed that.” He spots the tickets. “Nice one. Made up.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c128063ae7a4fcb51a479b5a10f43498e6dbca4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436197655373/c74e54a3-6df0-40e6-a168-39d8dde91878-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Piccadilly Records in Manchester\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piccadilly Records in Manchester.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We’re in Albert Square at the hub of the festival. Here the international festival mingles with the fringe and, right in the corner of the square, is the fringe of the fringe – Tim Peaks, being held at the Chop House. On the roof, 8ft wide and made from a shining yellow metal, is the fringe of the fringe of the fringe. This is the ultimate tribute to Burgess: his pudding-bowl haircut, sculpted by Welsh artist Pete Fowler.</p> \n<p>Burgess mentions a few Tim Peaks highlights. Recently, he formed a supergroup with Roddy Frame of Aztec Camera and Edwyn Collins of Orange Juice, and did a surprise gig. Most of his gigs these days seem to be surprises. The only problem is that he keeps giving it away. He stops to talk to Mark Radcliffe and Stuart Maconie, who are broadcasting their radio show from the city – and reveals tonight’s surprise gig, on the rooftop of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/mar/12/hotel-football-old-trafford-manchester-united-review\">Hotel Football</a>. (The real surprise turns out to be <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/the-charlatans/86678\">Gary Neville accompanying the Charlatans on acoustic guitar</a>.)</p> \n<p>After 12 years in Los Angeles, Burgess divorced and returned to England in 2011. He moved to Seven Sisters in north London, found love with Morgan’s mother, and now they split their time between Norfolk and Middlewich in Cheshire, where he has a studio. Despite its homage to Lynch, he says Tim Peaks is very much a product of the north-west and, in particular, Manchester. “People are very giving here. We couldn’t really do Tim Peaks anywhere else. Because all the hard work is done for nothing. And not that many people are prepared to give up so much time for nothing. That’s a northern thing. A rare thing. It’s something I wouldn’t even try outside Manchester.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97d41106acd595750a3a067ff1f1bdedb1bb090c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436197718552/384f345a-b809-4d95-afbc-fd0653ec2a37-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Fringe on the Chop House, Albert Square, Manchester\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Fringe on the Chop House, Albert Square, Manchester.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nigel Maitland/Nigel Maitland</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We are standing underneath the 8ft fringe, looking up, Burgess beaming with delight. “It’s really sweet.” But he acknowledges that his hair has divided Charlatans fans. “It has its own fan club now, but it’s been controversial. A lot of people still go on Facebook and say: ‘Change your hair colour, mate, sort your fucking barnet out.’ They can’t get their head around it.” Does he think his parents will feel a pang of pride when they see the fringe? “I think my mum will say: ‘Oh, you should have done your roots.’ But apart from that, I reckon she’ll like it.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em><a href=\"http://www.timpeaks.co.uk/\">Tim Peaks is at the Albert Square Chop House</a></em><em>.

Last year they trumpeted the biggest gas deal in history. The summer will be bookended by two striking events: Russian and Chinese warships puttering about together in the eastern Mediterranean in May, gaming war; and Russian and Chinese presidents standing shoulder to shoulder in Beijing for the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war in September. <br /></p> \n<p>So how robust is the Russia-China axis? <br /></p> \n<h2><strong>Geopolitics</strong></h2> \n<p>For China, one of the main attractions of closer relations with Russia is the potential for challenging Washington’s still dominant global position.</p> \n<p>“In China, where until recently the official line was ‘non-alignment’, some prominent scholars have started to make unambiguous calls for a comprehensive strategic alliance with Russia,” Alexander Korolev, at the National University of Singapore’s centre on Asia and globalisation, <a href=\"http://www.theasanforum.org/the-strategic-alignment-between-russia-and-china-myths-and-reality/\">argued recently</a>. “[They are] arguing on the pages of the CCP [Communist party] central party school’s internal publications that ‘China-Russia strategic relations are the most substantive ones’ and elsewhere that ‘China will be unable to shift the world from unipolarity to bipolarity unless it forms a formal alliance with Russia.’”</p> \n<p>But often cooperation and tension are two sides of the same coin. Take Central Asia. China’s president, Xi Jinping, has set his sights on a “new silk road”, using China’s billions to help neighbours and regional allies to develop, indirectly supporting growth at home and the expansion of Chinese soft power.</p> \n<p>However, this is also Russia’s traditional sphere of influence and any Chinese presence that goes beyond commercial dealings is likely to raise hackles in Moscow.</p> \n<p>“It’s totally possible for China to develop its relations with central Asian countries without challenging Russia,” said Liu Jun, a Russian studies expert at East China Normal University. “It’s true that Russia would be concerned if China’s influence in Central Asia grew too much, but the concerns are not mainstream in the bilateral relations – there are more benefits in cooperation than otherwise.”</p> \n<p>Russia shares the strategic goal of challenging US hegemony in favour of a more multipolar world, and the two powers often find themselves on the same side in the UN security council, where they wield vetoes as permanent members.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa01689f7092d16d0b84f3a7daf36d257f73b584\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435934830944/5c3bf8bd-dbc0-4807-aef9-89cef57eb05c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Vladimir Putin puts a shawl on Peng Liyuan, the wife of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at a firework display last year.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vladimir Putin puts a shawl on Peng Liyuan, the wife of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at a firework display last year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>No deal on regulating Iran’s nuclear programme can be made without Russia and China, which have staunchly backed its atomic expansion in the past, and the two countries’ support is largely the reason Bashar al-Assad has been able to hold on to power in Syria. Recently, Russia has been making political and economic overtures to North Korea, which relies on food, arms and energy from its key ally, China, to survive.</p> \n<p>As they support the idea of a multipolar world against American dominance, Moscow and Beijing will also tacitly back each others’ attempts to defend their own spheres of influence, said Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Centre. In the past two years, Russia has annexed Crimea and backed a separatist campaign to frustrate Ukraine’s turn to the west, and China has been disputing islands with western allies in the South China Sea.</p> \n<p>“China admits de facto that Russia has interests in eastern Europe, Russia admits that China has interests around the perimeter of its borders, and even though neither will actively help its partner in Ukraine or the South China Sea, both will observe an advantageous neutrality,” Trenin said. “There won’t be criticism of each other in the areas of their core interests.”</p> \n<h2>Leadership</h2> \n<p>Government enthusiasm for warmer ties with Russia is summed up by a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/XinhuaNewsAgency/videos/1053445368016240/?pnref=story\">recent video from the state-controlled Xinhua news agency</a> entitled What Do Chinese People Think About Russia?”<br /></p> \n<p>It features Chinese children describing Russia as “even bigger than China”, an old man praising Russia’s strength, demands for more investment, gas sales, a high-speed train, and plenty of airtime given to adulation of the Russian president.</p> \n<p>Putin has long been popular in China, where he is seen as a strong leader who has bolstered national pride, and is not a little admired for his topless photo shoots. “Putin you’re a handsome man,” says one middle-aged woman on being asked what message she would like to send to Moscow.</p> \n<p>There is also an overt comparison to Xi, who has fostered a personality cult of bold leadership that has echoes of the Russian leader’s (though with less bare flesh). “Putin is the same as our ‘Papa Xi’,” says one young man, using a government endorsed affectionate term for the president.</p> \n<p>For their part, Russians are more ambivalent about Xi, who has a far lower profile in Russia than does his counterpart in China.</p> \n<h2><strong>Trade</strong></h2> \n<p>China’s interest in Russian exports has until now been largely focused on natural resources and military hardware. Beyond that they do not make natural partners. Russia can offer little by way of famous brands or innovation in consumer technology to tempt ordinary Chinese customers.</p> \n<p>“It’s a good thing that there is political will behind the business cooperation. Without it, a lot of things won’t happen,” Liu said. “Most big projects are backed by the governments and the volume of trade along the border is quite small.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Russia-China trade\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1431525887794/China-Russia-trade.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The imbalance of the relationship can be seen in the breakdown of their bilateral trade, worth around $100bn a year. China is Russia’s second largest trading partner after the EU, while Russia only just scraped into a list of China’s top 10 trading partners, accounting for barely 3% of the country’s total trade volume. </p> \n<p>Moscow is also hoping Beijing will help with finance for businesses, after western funds dried up last year. Some Chinese firms have seen the Russian economic wobble as an opportunity to make capital investments in the country.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Chinese FDI\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1431538153770/FDI-china-2.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Energy</strong></h2> \n<p>China and Russia should make natural partners in energy deals, but in reality they have struggled to turn past agreements into real supply deals; pipelines announced last decade have still not been built because of disagreements over pricing and other conditions.<br /></p> \n<p>Earlier this year, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/datablog/2015/jun/24/russia-overtakes-saudi-arabia-largest-supplier-oil-china\">Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the largest supplier of oil to China </a>for the first time, with Russian exports to China more than doubling since 2010. But Beijing is accustomed to shopping around for energy and driving a very cheap bargain with its suppliers, while Russia is used to controlling prices for European customers with few other options. </p> \n<p>The expansion of shale gas production may have weakened Russia’s hand by improving global supply, but China is also increasingly concerned about climate change and needs to wean itself off the dirty coal that still provides well over half its energy.</p> \n<p>Since Russia has rarely agreed to sell stakes in strategic land-based deposits to western companies, Putin’s offer of a stake in state oil champion Rosneft’s biggest production asset, the Vankor oilfields, to China in September underlined the new direction the country’s energy policy is taking. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f8025e9d3552689dd5f540fd9670ef8d3c0ba04\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435936243060/07a2c975-ea56-40d4-92a5-6122f23702af-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Workers inspect the pipelines and oil storage tanks of a crude oil pipeline between Russia and China in Heilongjiang province, north-east China.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers inspect the pipelines and oil storage tanks of a crude oil pipeline between Russia and China in Heilongjiang province, north-east China.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wang Jianwei/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The offer was made at a ceremony to start construction of Russia’s $55bn Power of Siberia pipeline, a breakthrough project that is planned to deliver an annual 38bn cubic metres of gas to eastern China over the next 30 years. In November, the two countries also signed a framework agreement for an Altai gas pipeline to potentially supply 30bn cubic metres of gas to western China each year for 30 years.<br /></p> \n<p>But neither pipeline deal appears to have been completely finalised, and economic sanctions and a weak rouble will probably make financing the huge projects difficult for Russia’s Gazprom. </p> \n<p>“It seems like at every meeting there’s some sort of document signed and hailed as another big agreement … but Gazprom will need to develop large fields and construct the pipelines,” said Grigory Birg, an analyst at Investcafe. “I think in the current environment securing the finances is the major holdup, and we don’t have any indication as to the economics of the project.” </p> \n<p>Although Birg estimated the rate of return on the Power of Siberia investment to be a modest 9% to 10% when the deal was signed, the profitability is likely to be even less if global oil prices remain weak. Beijing will, by all appearances, be able to drive an even harder bargain for the gas price under the proposed Altai pipeline to western China, a region that has less demand than the industrialised east of the country and already receives cheap gas from nearby Turkmenistan.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, analysts expect energy cooperation to continue to grow as Russia seeks alternatives to the politically thorny European market, and China addresses growing demand and problems with pollution and blackouts. Last year, China replaced Germany as Russia’s biggest buyer of crude oil. “China is the major alternative market and is easily accessible for Russia given the [location of energy] reserves and the geopolitical partnership, so it’s an obvious fit,” Birg said. “But the timing at which it is happening is not in favour of Russia.”</p> \n<h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/pipelines_map-zip/giv-21277JzjaoGmQKK30/\" data-alt=\"Pipeline to china\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/pipelines_map-zip/giv-21277JzjaoGmQKK30/\">Pipeline to china</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Currency</strong></h2> \n<p>Both Russia and China have an interest in loosening the US dollar’s dominance in global trade as the world’s reserve currency. <a href=\"http://uk.businessinsider.com/russia-just-one-upped-the-saudis-in-china-2015-6?r=US\">Russia now accepts yuan for oil payments</a> (something that other oil exporters, such as Saudi Arabia, don’t do).</p> \n<p>Following the imposition of sanctions, Russian companies and banks – traditionally reliant on dollar-denominated syndicated loans – started to look to China for a financial escape route. The <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-08-06/dim-sum-yields-jumping-show-hurdles-in-russian-pivot-east.html\">rouble-yuan currency pair</a> reached records in trading volumes last summer. </p> \n<p>Russian companies are not new to the renminbi market, nor to the issuing of “dim sum bonds” – bonds denominated in Chinese yuan and largely issued by entities based in China or Hong Kong. In the past these options represented a cheaper source of funding. Now they’re a necessity. However, <a href=\"http://www.ifrasia.com/asian-markets-no-quick-fix-for-russia/21158400.article\">yields on Russian corporate bonds denominated in yuan have increased</a> as the list of sanctions started mounting up.</p> \n<h2><strong>Military </strong></h2> \n<p>Russian arms sales to China have been estimated at $1bn a year, the Russians were previously hesitant to give advanced weaponry to the Soviet Union’s one-time military rival. But the recent announcement by Russia’s state arms exporter of a deal to supply China with its S-400 surface-to-air missile systems has taken their relationship to a new level at a time when Beijing is seeking new air and naval defence technologies.<br /></p> \n<p>The higher-level arms sales have been accompanied by greater military cooperation, which was on display in May with the war games in the Mediterranean Sea. Such exercises in what has traditionally been a “Nato pond” are designed to expand the Chinese navy’s reach while showing the United States that Russia is a potentially important military partner, according to Trenin. </p> \n<p>Following the Ukraine crisis, which soured relations with the west, he said the main considerations behind Russia’s “entente” with China were political. “Now Russia has an important stimulus to grow relations with China, because relations with the west are troubled, and China is the only large player in the world that can be considered as economic, political and to a certain extent military ally,” Trenin said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Both sides, meanwhile, are concerned that the unrest in Pakistan and Afghanistan could spill over into their territory, or serve as incubators for militants who may one day return home.<br /></p> \n<p>But none of that means that either side has forgotten past disputes or present differences. Russia is nervous about China sapping its revenue by reverse engineering the equipment it buys, and is also monitoring Beijing closely for any attempts to project military power into central Asia. </p> \n<p>“China and Russia’s strategic partnership is a result of the times, but it is totally different from a military alliance such as the one between the US and Japan,” the Global Times, a Chinese nationalist tabloid, said in a recent editorial.</p> \n<p>“China and Russia have repeatedly stated that they will become partners, not allies. They do mean that. China also cares about relations with western countries. Russia does not want to see relations with the west become a deadlock.”<br /> </p> \n<h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/dlouter/boxout/#/july2015/russiachina\" data-alt=\"UN vetoes\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/dlouter/boxout/#/july2015/russiachina\">UN vetoes</a> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Cyber security</strong></h2> \n<p>Both Russia and China share a concern over the US domination of the internet. In January, Russia, China and a number of central Asian dictatorships <a href=\"https://ccdcoe.org/sites/default/files/documents/UN-150113-CodeOfConduct.pdf\">jointly submitted a new proposal</a> for an international code of conduct on information security to the UN general assembly.<br /></p> \n<p>In a clause clearly aimed at the US, the document calls for countries “not to use information and communications technologies and … networks to interfere in the internal affairs of other states or with the aim of undermining their political, economic and social stability”.</p> \n<p>At a recent internet security forum in Moscow, officials from both countries called for a new approach to online security.</p> \n<p>“It’s great they [the US] invented the iPhone but when you open your iPhone and see the camera you have to guess whether it’s photographing you at that moment or not,” said Konstantin Malofeyev, a controversial businessman known for his backing for the Russian Orthodox church and the pro-Russian separatist movement in east Ukraine. “Russia went into space first and Antarctic first but we don’t control those things, they are controlled by international charters. Why should the US control the internet?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d7715bc3ba3c39261db43d1ac88c2eea1b6ed184\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435936448340/2522f82f-7db0-4efc-9664-81fdff967ee8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Chinese flag in front of the Google China headquarters in Beijing.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Chinese flag in front of the Google China headquarters in Beijing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sinopix/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Chinese official Chen Xiaohua said: “We should join hands to build cyberspace order.

Beijing’s “great firewall” is a powerful and sophisticated filter of the online world, but is still porous enough that most people inside China do not need to bother trying to evade it.</p> \n<p>Both countries also field armies of both hackers and paid pro-government commenters, known in China as the “50 cent” group, because of how much they are paid for each post. However, experts say their focus on internal controls may have come at the expense of security.</p> \n<p>“Prioritising political information control over technical cyber defence also damages China’s own cybersecurity,” Jon Lindsay of Harvard University’s Belfer centre for science and international affairs said in a <a href=\"http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/publication/25321/exaggerating_the_chinese_cyber_threat.html\">recent briefing</a>. “Lax law enforcement and poor cyber defences leave the country vulnerable to both cyber criminals and foreign spies.” </p> \n<h2><strong>Business mood</strong></h2> \n<p>Among some business people, there is a fear that the enforced turn to the east will mean Russia selling out from a position of weakness.</p> \n<p>“The downturn in relations with the west is bad for Russia and bad for the west; the only beneficiary is China,” one top Russian businessman said. “The number of Chinese delegations coming to Russia has gone up tenfold, and the Chinese will only enter the market when they see the conditions are very beneficial to them.”</p> \n<p>Russian media have been told to play up links with China and other non-western countries, and companies have felt pressure from the government to look eastwards even if it makes little business sense. But what initially seemed pointless may be starting to bear some fruit.</p> \n<p>“It started as theatre, but now there are some companies out there really getting stuff done,” said Tom Blackwell, CEO of EM, a consultancy firm that has worked with a number of major Russian companies on exploring the Chinese market. “Chinese investment funds have very little experience or knowledge about Russia and it’s a hard sell. But the strategy seems to be to do the big state deals first and assume smaller ones will follow. Slowly, real things are happening.”</p> \n<p>Russia’s federal migration service is especially wary of an influx of Chinese migrants across the Russia-China border. It <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=82969\">has stated</a> that Chinese could become the largest ethnic group in Russia’s far east by the 2020s or 2030s; last summer a border official said that 1.5 million Chinese illegally entered the region from January 2013 to June 2014. </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435933928975/5999b7cb-c62f-44f3-907c-107de12e6edf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media","altText":"Xi Jinping welcomes Vladimir Putin to Shanghai last year","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Xinhua /Landov / Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435934832320/5c3bf8bd-dbc0-4807-aef9-89cef57eb05c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Vladimir Putin puts a shawl on Peng Liyuan, the wife of the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, at a firework display last year.

At the club’s annual general meeting at the Palace theatre on Tottenham Court Road, 50.5% voted in favour of allowing females to join. The club requires a two-thirds majority before rules can be changed.</p> \n<p>The decision to continue to exclude women is significant because the Garrick Club has a place at the heart of the British establishment, with supreme court judges, cabinet ministers, academics, senior civil servants, diplomats and journalists among its members, as well as well-known actors.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2015/apr/30/time-gentlemen-when-will-last-all-male-clubs-admit-women\">Time, gentlemen: when will the last all-male clubs admit women? | Amelia Gentleman</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The motion, put forward by former Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews, proposed: “For the avoidance of doubt it shall be a rule of the club that membership shall not be subject to any quota system based on ethnicity, gender, beliefs or otherwise.”</p> \n<p>Members such as the actors Stephen Fry, Damian Lewis and Hugh Bonneville had indicated before the poll that they were in favour of extending membership to women, as had the justice secretary, Michael Gove, former justice secretary Ken Clarke and broadcasters Sir Trevor McDonald, Melvyn Bragg and Jeremy Paxman.</p> \n<p>But those in favour of admitting women failed to get the required 66% of votes. Three former Conservative MPs and 11 QCs were among those who said they would vote to continue to exclude women members.</p> \n<p>Lewis said he had voted in favour of letting women in and was “disappointed” at the result. Broadcaster John Simpson shrugged and said: “What can you do? Nobody in the Garrick feels this is the end of the road.”</p> \n<p>But there was some optimism from pro-female members that for the first<br />time there had been a majority in favour. Several members said they expected the issue to be raised again in the near future.</p> \n<p>More than 500 of the club’s members queued in the full summer heat outside the Palace theatre to vote in a secret ballot, via electronic handsets. Some men came looking dapper in a 1950s way, in rumpled cream suits with panama hats and umbrellas or walking sticks. Many came wearing the club’s salmon pink and cucumber tie or bow tie, accessorising the look with socks and handkerchiefs in the club’s colours. </p> \n<p>The average age of those in the club is 69, according to one member. Arriving at the theatre to vote, Paxman looked at the queue and said: “Bunch of old men. I’m in the right place then.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ece9cadb201d29a5a0b41e94f70a631fdd9c35d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ece9cadb201d29a5a0b41e94f70a631fdd9c35d8/0_258_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Garrick club members leave after voting.

The Garrick is one of a handful of gentlemen’s clubs in London that still refuses to allow women members. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amelia Gentleman for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sir Eric Ash said he was voting for women, adding: “It seems absolutely absurd that they aren’t in already.”</p> \n<p>Sir John Weston also said he was supporting the call for women to be allowed to join. “About time, too. I think women will do a lot for the good sense of the club,” he said.</p> \n<p>Another member said he had been undecided about how to vote. He asked: “I’m a huge supporter of all things anti-racist, non-gender and anti-ageist but why shouldn’t we have one or two places where chaps can get together?”</p> \n<p>The Garrick is one of a handful of gentlemen’s clubs in London that still refuses to allow women members, along with White’s – where David Cameron was a member until he became leader of the Conservative party – Pratt’s, Boodles, Brooks’s, the Turf Club and the Travellers Club. At various points over the past 30 years, establishments such as the Reform Club, the Athenaeum and the Carlton Club have voted to admit women.</p> \n<p>When the 2010 Equality Act was drafted, there was some discussion by Labour MPs of whether the legislation could be used to make these clubs illegal, but this proved impossible without simultaneously making it illegal to have, for example, women-only swimming clubs. The act banned clubs from excluding people on the basis of colour but allowed them to continue excluding women.</p> \n<p>With a large number of members well past retirement age, many Garrick members protest that the club is no longer a bastion of male influence where crucial networking takes place, preferring to cast it as a gentle backwater, where people go to relax and retreat from their professional lives. Only a few concede that it is still an important place for making informal but useful work-related connections.</p> \n<p>But there has been growing antipathy among women in the legal profession towards a club that welcomes so many male QCs and judges, yet excludes women. Baroness Hale, Britain’s most senior female judge, the first and only woman among 12 supreme court judges (several of whom are Garrick club members), has expressed outrage at the club’s continued exclusion of women. “I regard it as quite shocking that so many of my colleagues belong to the Garrick, but they don’t see what all the fuss is about,” she told a law diversity forum. She said judges “should be committed to the principle of equality for all”.<br /></p> \n<p>Trying to explain why the club was better without women, one member said: “Men behave differently if there are no women there. There is camaraderie, banter … the knowledge that you can say anything you want and have a jolly good discussion about anything in a completely egalitarian atmosphere in which no one is trying to impress anyone else.</p> \n<p>“That’s my main objection to having women members – it’s not against women, but the idea that some men would not be able to resist showing off to impress the women, that is an innate male characteristic, whether you are a bird or an animal. At the moment, any sort of pomposity or self-importance is punctured. You don’t need to show off, you can be yourself, have uninhibited conversation, indulge in flights of fantasy. Having women members would change the nature of the club.”</p> \n<p>Women are allowed to enter the Garrick as guests of members, but there are places within the building where they (as non-members) are not permitted to go.</p> \n<p>Club officials said there would be no comment on the vote. Members left the theatre to walk to the club building in nearby Covent Garden for an all-club dinner.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <blockquote> \n  <br /> \n </blockquote> \n <blockquote> \n  <br /> \n </blockquote> \n</blockquote>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8ac2cd3a44d7ff8e6fc2cd2fb69072c701d06f50/0_329_2100_1260/2100.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1260,"width":2100,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Christopher Cormack/Corbis","altText":"Garrick Club","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Christopher Cormack/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ece9cadb201d29a5a0b41e94f70a631fdd9c35d8/0_258_3264_1958/3264.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1958,"width":3264,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Garrick club members leave after voting.
