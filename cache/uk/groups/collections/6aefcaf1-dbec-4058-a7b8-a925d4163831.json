She’s wearing a red top hat, a heart-patterned dress and a huge smile. Flirting workshops have long been a popular choice for hen parties and singles nights but when couples seek flirting tips it’s often couched in the context of counselling or a desperate attempt to “spice things up”.</p> \n<p>What’s changed is that couples these days attend flirting workshops for fun. “Couples at the workshops are almost always in a good place in their relationship,” says Mackenzie. “They can work on it and have a fun night out.”</p> \n<p>Flirting with a partner is different from flirting to bag one. Without the fear of rejection, flirting becomes a simple renewal of the “I love yous” you’ve already exchanged, rather than a jump-start you only reach for when the relationship starts to sputter. “The first few months of a relationship are intense,” says Mackenzie, “then we think, ‘they’re bagged’. But a relationship can’t run on those six months. Would you expect your car to run on six months of petrol?”</p> \n<h2>Silliness</h2> \n<p>Mackenzie tells us to laugh. The fake-ophony of “hahaha” is so difficult to maintain I’m almost relieved when we’re instructed to tickle the people either side of us.</p> \n<p>When we’ve finished assaulting strangers, Mackenzie explains the reason for the silliness: it facilitates flirting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdf1b44dbe91db55378136eda8c6603d0c67921b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217630776/60e84db3-bded-4570-b464-25f0b5716533-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kiss me, you fool.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Seriousness tends to creep into early-stage relationships when you’re establishing how “serious” you are about one another and being honest about fear of heartbreak and abandonment. And no one ever flirted successfully with the opening line: “If you leave me, I swear to god …”</p> \n<p>Eschewing seriousness is easy for my partner and me. Five years in, we’re past the “where is this going?” stage, but far from worrying about primary school places or lice. We planned a wedding day prank before we booked a venue. We have silliness down pat. Next.</p> \n<h2>Simmering</h2> \n<p>“Sometimes you’re not feeling that sexy,” says Mackenzie in the workshop, “so collect sexy feelings and build them into a sensation you can have later when you see your partner.”</p> \n<p>I’m unsure as to where I can store a “sexy feeling” until my fiance staggers through the door, battered and war-weary from the commute. So the next weeknight, I try something else Mackenzie advises and envision myself running up and giving him a great big hug and kiss.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55200ba7869f5e26f31c721fd72b5eb988ad258e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217291983/fb2b6f35-e795-4438-a49f-35a0ab970900-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We have silliness down pat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I hear the key in the door and almost trip over the cat as I rush to comply with my “vision”. We’ll call that a dress rehearsal.</p> \n<p>It goes down much better than the usual grunt from behind a computer screen. Later, as he chops vegetables and I finish an article, we find ourselves catching each other’s eye and smiling.</p> \n<p>“It’s working,” he says. “We’re adorable. I kind of hate us.”</p> \n<h2>Thoughtfulness</h2> \n<p>What could be more flirtatious than showing you’re thinking about your partner’s desires?</p> \n<p>“It can be as simple as buying tickets to a football match you know they want to see.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c3f531a326f40587de7c7acb8d4d61cfaf29e32\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217390108/48f35032-db87-479a-820c-f0263ada99e0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tickets!</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If thoughtfulness were a competition, I’d be losing. We lived with his father for a while, and I had a kettle in my room and would pop downstairs for milk. One morning I went down earlier than usual and happened upon my father-in-law-to-be strolling around naked in the kitchen.</p> \n<p>From that day on, my partner left a jug of milk on my bedside table while I was sleeping. Every morning. How am I supposed to top that?</p> \n<p>Since he’s been complaining that he can’t resist the omnipresent office treats, I slip a bag of almonds into his jacket pocket with a note that says: “Don’t eat cake”. I’ll work on it.</p> \n<h2>Self-love</h2> \n<p>Self-deprecation jars with the act of flirting, says Mackenzie. You wouldn’t offer homemade cookies saying: “Would you like one? I understand if not: they’re doughy and nowhere near as sexy as they used to be.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43f3225f25c73aa7e830e89d84187b865e9cc784\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217459307/24a1ecfb-65b1-4943-ba1f-1b4402a8de80-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr Potato Head, holding a pair of eyeballs with hearts on them, clearly feeling self-love.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m a rampant self-deprecator, so I start small. I don’t croon “I’m irresistible”. But when he tells me I look nice I say “thanks” instead of turning my belly button into a mouth-puppet and making it say: “No, she looks like a Teletubby with tits.”</p> \n<p>This unnerving alter-ego of low self-esteem – or, as we call it, “Belly Furtado” – has no place in a flirtatious situation. I know that now.</p> \n<h2>Role play</h2> \n<p>Mackenzie suggests: “Tell your partner to wear certain clothes and meet you to role play fantasy figures.”</p> \n<p>We decide to be ourselves in a parallel universe where we never met in a philosophy tutorial and awkwardly made arrangements to see Shrek 2, to which one of us turned up doused in CK1 cologne. I won’t say which one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25d9854b1d91f1e79e55b9eeb86aabda1944540f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217571292/ec1f5a51-9308-41a2-8f37-26436630863d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I am irresistible.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Saturday evening, a few days after the workshop, I sit on a train and try not to giggle as he gets on and pretends not to know me. He saunters over.</p> \n<p>“Hello. I fancy you. Would you like to watch Netflix with me this evening? In pyjamas?”</p> \n<p>“That’s the creepiest chat-up line I’ve ever heard.”</p> \n<p>“You would though, wouldn’t you?”</p> \n<p>“Yes.”</p> \n<p>This is where couples have the edge over singles when it comes to flirting: your partner already knows what you like and how you like it. And that, put to good use, is irresistible.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432138362101/Potato-men-for-Do-Somethi-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Collect sexy feelings and build them into a sensation you can have later when you see your partner.'

Chucking a load of ingredients into the pan and hoping for the best doesn’t really wash here, however hard you scrub.</p> \n<p>Softer and crumblier than toffee, smoother and richer than its close relative, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jan/22/how-to-make-perfect-tablet-recipe\">tablet</a>, its dairy content means fudge is associated particularly with the south-west, though shops churning it out in a mind-boggling array of weird and only occasionally wonderful flavours are de rigueur in tourist honeypots throughout the British Isles. But before you can hope to achieve gingerbread latte-flavoured nirvana, you need a decent basic template. Which is where I come in.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f065b50c0df00b1649efd4ede1e3f264952dc6c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945038112/489c17fb-823b-4928-8bbc-15c242138ea4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Carnation's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carnation’s fudge recipe stipulates demerara sugar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The sugar</h2> \n<p>Lest anyone was under any illusions in this department, the main ingredient of fudge is sugar – that’s why you can feel your teeth wince in protest as you reach for yet another piece. If you want to keep things simple, like candy <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">pros Mrs Hope and Mr Greenwood</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">folk from Rodda’s clotted cream</a> and <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/caramel-mousse-recipe\">Michelin-star chef Tom Aikens</a>, this can be caster or ordinary white granulated, but given sugar plays such a large part, the demerara suggested by the <a href=\"https://www.carnation.co.uk/recipes/67/Ultimate-Fudge\">Carnation condensed milk tin</a> or the light muscovado used by <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/creamy-sea-salted-fudge-recipe/#ftsTEEwRpKOcplKw.97\">Ren Behan in Jamie magazine</a> will give a more interesting flavour. Personally, I prefer the slightly more subtle caramel notes of the first here.</p> \n<p>Aikens and Roddas both also add some sugar syrup – boring glucose in the former case, ambrosial golden in the latter – which makes their fudge wonderfully smooth as opposed to the slightly gritty, sandy texture of the Carnation and Hope and Greenwood recipes, which, though undoubtedly pleasing, is more reminiscent of Scottish tablet. Clearly feeling two types of sugar aren’t quite enough, Aikens finishes his fudge with an infinitesimal amount of icing sugar, for, no doubt, very sound Michelin-starred reasons which I am unable to fathom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15f50824423376fe7324855e6d5deb45f925ddde\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945143833/02911193-5340-4c62-9f42-70adb1e18073-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roddas's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roddas’s fudge goes all out with clotted cream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The dairy</h2> \n<p>The second, and most important, ingredient in fudge is fat. Dairy fat to be precise. Some recipes cleverly combine the two ingredients in one big hit of nauseatingly delicious condensed milk, which makes their fudge taste distinctly like white chocolate – not that there’s anything wrong with this, but it’s not the classic flavour I’m after.</p> \n<p>Hope and Greenwood plump for the nostalgic boiled flavour of evaporated milk instead, an ingredient that has so far failed to reinvent itself for a more decadent age. Despite a weird complaint that it tastes “meaty”, I happen to like it, but not as much as the clotted cream which plays an unsurprisingly large part in the Roddas recipe, or the double variety in Aikens’s fudge.</p> \n<p>In fact, the Roddas recipe proves pretty popular; soft, smooth and rich, it’s classic Cornish seaside stuff. My only complaint is that the flavour is a little too sweet and rich, which I admit may sound ridiculous, but in a side-by-side comparison, we preferred those recipes using butter as well. Let’s be honest, everything’s better with butter. But, as butter and clotted cream could prove a fatal combination, a downgrade to double seems just what the doctor ordered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb2e571089756166bf95884fb673baae2a7c905b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945257884/e7b22b5b-562c-436a-b61f-86987205051f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ren Behan's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ren Behan’s recipes uses vanilla extract.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The flavouring</h2> \n<p>Though to make this a fair test I omit Hope and Greenwood’s peanut butter (anything containing peanut butter is always going to win big for me), I do allow Roddas, Behan and Aikens their vanilla. Not strictly necessary for a satisfactory result, but a lovely combination of flavours nevertheless – and this is one place where I think vanilla extract works better than those fiddly little seeds. Salt is another must – as ever, it brings out the best in the sugar, keeping it just the right side of sickly. How much you add depends on how enthusiastically you have embraced salted caramel mania over the last few years; sceptics will be content with a pinch, salt fiends like myself should up the dosage considerably. In for a penny, in for a pound.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28087b3b2da0edb1419a066bbbc37cab6d8e9da5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945369181/d110d9e0-c45d-47e4-9883-ecdc4f5be5c9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Aikens fudge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Aikens uses a high temperature to produce a more brittle fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>All the recipes I try start in much the same way, dissolving the sugar and dairy together over heat, bringing the resulting mixture to the boil, and then letting it simmer until it reaches the desired setting temperature. (Covering the pan, as Roddas suggest, works fine, but feels a bit scary to me; I prefer to keep my molten sugar where I can see it.)</p> \n<p>The difference comes in temperature, which ranges from 113C from Behan, which gives a very soft, almost fondant-like result, to Aikens’s 121C, which is brittle and chewy, more like a hard caramel than a fudge. Even Hope and Greenwood and Carnation’s 118C is a bit harder than I had expect from a fudge – my testers and I agree that Roddas have hit the sweet spot at 116C: firm enough to hold its shape, soft enough to melt in the mouth.</p> \n<p>Lots of recipes give advice about how to achieve this without a sugar thermometer (dropping a little into a glass of cold water until it reaches a pliable consistency), but this is a fiddly and inexact science, so I’d recommend investing in a sugar thermometer. They’re not expensive, and they’ll work forever (though be careful when washing as they can be delicate).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff868836c9b6e7193c7f55d0a3b6ca6c64059f29\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945538506/71cf141a-be66-4573-94d9-0c1097f9e045-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hope &amp; Greenwood's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hope &amp; Greenwood’s fudge has a slightly gritty texture.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Stirring?</h2> \n<p>Fudge, like tablet, is beaten as it cools to help it thicken.

But less than a week after the election, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/nigel-farage-advisers-quit-ukip-civil-war-raheem-kassam-matthew-richardson\">Kassam was pressured out of his job</a> in one of Ukip’s periodic bouts of infighting.</p> \n<p>So what is his verdict on eight months at the heart of Farage’s empire? “I totally regret it. Every minute,” he says. “I don’t mean it was a horrible experience. But I’ve taken a big hit for nothing. The only good thing that’s come out of this are friendships ... But have I got anything else apart from looking at much of Ukip and thinking you are just a bunch of ragtag, unprofessional, embarrassing people who let Nigel down at every juncture? No.”</p> \n<p>The public feuding kicked off after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/11/nigel-farage-withdraws-resignation-as-ukip-leader\">Farage decided to “un-resign”</a>, going back on his promise to step down <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/video/2015/may/08/nigel-farage-resigns-ukip-south-thanet-general-election-video\">after he failed to win his target seat of South Thanet</a>. In the fallout, Kassam’s detractors accused him of being a divisive Iago-type figure, dripping rightwing poison into Farage’s ear that harmed the party’s chances of winning over moderate voters. According to his critics, it was Kassam’s “shock and awe” strategy that led Farage to warn against <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/oct/10/nigel-farage-keep-hiv-positive-migrants-out-britain\">foreigners with HIV</a> using the NHS and claim there were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/28/nigel-farage-eu-response-to-migrant-boat-crisis-would-bring-jihadis-to-uk\">half a million Islamist extremists among the migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2fd9f10a0ffb99e67d24cf1ac8932c15921a7923\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957831247/e8348b58-f79c-416e-9920-473d4765cf67-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Raheem Kassam.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Kassam.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Kassam denies this was ever his game plan – his theory is that people were jealous that he got too close to the Ukip leader, to the exclusion of almost every other acolyte. By polling day, it was obvious to those following the Ukip campaign that the inner court of King Nigel had shrunk to Kassam, election strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe and his Kent press officer Sarah White.</p> \n<p>“Egos got in the way at every point,” Kassam says. “Who do you think Nigel would call? It was always me. They absolutely hated that. But the truth of it was that we were always mopping up everyone’s messes.”</p> \n<p>We meet at the Blue Boar, a regular haunt in Westminster, and the supremely confident Kassam seems unfazed. He has just returned from a holiday in the US, is back at his old job at the rightwing news site <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/\">Breitbart</a> and is ready to lift the lid on some bizarre and dysfunctional happenings that dogged Ukip’s campaign. Over a drink, he’s keen to outline what went wrong. The confusion over whether Farage should back a cap on immigrants? “It created an impression of chaos. There is no way to look at it and think: ‘These guys really know what they are talking about.’” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/mar/24/janice-atkinson-expelled-ukip-false-expenses-claims\">The suspension of gaffe-prone Janice Atkinson</a> as an MEP for allegedly trying to inflate her expenses? “Nigel wanted her out before that. She should have gone when she said ‘<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/aug/18/ukip-mep-apology-thai-insult\">ting-tong</a>’.”</p> \n<p>The feuding between Farage’s personal team and officials at party HQ? “It was like a playground in there ... It got to the point where journalists would come into HQ and we’d have to lock certain doors because the people behind those doors were too embarrassing to be seen.” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/15/ukip-manifesto-2015-the-key-points\">The manifesto</a>? “It was a clusterfuck.” A particular party activist who remained in post despite a chequered history? “Disgraceful. The man is a racist, there is no doubt about it ... I don’t throw around racism often, I have a high threshold for it because I’m so anti-PC, but he is a definite racist.”</p> \n<p>Kassam says this was the only example of racism that he encountered during his time in the party and that he faced more prejudice when he was a member of the Conservative party. The most surreal moment? When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jan/20/ukip-health-party-rejects-nigel-farage-nhs-reform\">Louise Bours, the health spokeswoman, decided to resign in the middle of one of Farage’s rallies in a row over NHS spending</a>. “Afterwards, I had to lock everyone out of the room and tell Nigel. I can’t repeat what he said then.” She was later persuaded to stay and the episode never became public.</p> \n<p>He blames three senior Ukip figures for engineering his exit from the party and trying to orchestrate a coup against Farage – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/live/2015/may/19/yvette-cooper-says-labour-sounded-anti-worker-for-people-in-big-firms-politics-live\">Patrick O’Flynn</a>, the former economics spokesman, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/26/ukips-evans-calls-for-cross-party-alliance-to-create-eu-referendum-no-campaign\">Suzanne Evans, the deputy chairman</a>, and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/douglas-carswell\">Douglas Carswell</a>, the party’s only MP. This is a charge they all deny, but O’Flynn was stripped of his frontbench role and Evans of her responsibility for policy in the aftermath of the row. Kassam reckons Carswell will survive just another six months in Ukip because he is no longer useful, given that the party has turned down almost &pound;1m of public funding<strong> </strong>due to him as an MP. “Douglas is not worth anything, he has no clout. He means nothing to us now,” he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b4c5434bf1e226f423ad25f5f80e9dca6f8e14d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957942036/7fecd095-a673-4458-8f07-c8545aa22f7f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Farage hears of his defeat in South Thanet on 8 May, with fellow contestants Will Scobie and Al Murray.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farage hears of his defeat in South Thanet on 8 May, with fellow contestants Will Scobie and Al Murray.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On O’Flynn, he is equally scathing: “I’m sorry, but if you are Patrick O’Flynn and you have managed via your morning briefings to elicit a headline that says the EU is brainwashing our children through colouring books – OK, you tell me who is doing more damage to the party? And you know what the worst thing is? I went out to bat for those guys every time when they were in trouble.”</p> \n<p>Kassam claims that even before the election he could see a “plot” coming and warned Farage to no avail. “I predicted everything that would happen – the Suzanne stuff, the Carswell stuff, the Patrick stuff – nobody listened to me,” he says. “It earned me a lot of credit with Nigel that I foresaw that.”</p> \n<p>Not enough to keep him in the job, some might say, with the others still in the party. But Kassam claims he was not forced out of his role as Farage’s senior adviser, but instead chose to leave at the end of his contract in order to “bulletproof Nigel”.</p> \n<p>His argument goes like this: the anti-Farage camp believed the Ukip leader was veering too far to the right and had become too toxic to lead an EU referendum campaign that was now going to happen under a Cameron majority government. As Kassam’s critics lined up, painting him as a malign Tea Party influence on Farage, he says he was confronted with the choice of trying to brave out the row or resigning temporarily before returning as part of the leader’s Brussels staff. As it happened, Kassam was on the way to see his old boss at Breitbart in the US at the time, and was offered his former job back on the spot. He downed a shot of vodka, and then made his way to the Sky News studio to start defending Farage and attacking O’Flynn, including accusing him of having “personal problems” live on air.</p> \n<p>“In those situations it’s fight or flight. You can crumble or you can rise to the occasion. I was sitting there thinking: it’s fine. It’s just a job, I did my best. If I genuinely thought I’d let Nigel down in any way I would have been upset and distracted ... But basically I’ve formed a one-man human shield around Nigel. Every time they go for him, who will the journalists come to for background and quotes? I’m his forcefield at the moment. He knows it to be true to this minute.”</p> \n<p>Certainly, the whole episode has not dented Kassam’s loyalty to Farage, whom he describes as his “hero”. He claims they still speak regularly, most recently the day before – about the content of his speeches, social media and just general chat. Not coincidentally, Farage has also just signed up as Breitbart’s new star columnist. So why is he speaking out now, and would Farage be unhappy about what he has to say to the media? “Probably. But that’s my prerogative. “I think Nigel’s had a rough time, unfairly. And I’ve had a rough time, unfairly. That’s why.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72839876c8e68542a5c2c60aab90487075ad58db\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433958056798/95ef4dcb-211b-46ca-9d4f-8af8af80b556-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Douglas Carswell and Nigel Farage in happier times.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Douglas Carswell and Nigel Farage in happier times.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The 28-year-old son of Muslim immigrants who live in Uxbridge, Kassam might not seem the most likely choice to become friends with the leader of Ukip, but he has a history of working for rightwing websites and the <a href=\"http://henryjacksonsociety.org/\">Henry Jackson Society</a> thinktank. He says he first bonded with Farage when they met in the US and went on to have what is known in the Ukip lexicon as a number of “PFLs” – proper fucking lunches, defined by the number of bottles of wine that are consumed. After he was hired – despite warnings in the media about his “wild self-importance” – Kassam believes he became invaluable to Farage because he was one of the few people to stand up to him.</p> \n<p>During the last six weeks of the election campaign, Kassam was dispatched to the target constituency to take charge as it became clear the Tories were throwing in more resources. He immediately moved into Farage’s flat in Ramsgate, which became a place where there was a wine glass stuffed with cigarettes butts, an electricity meter that kept running out of credit and Farage’s bed was a mattress on the living room floor. “It looked like a Damien Hirst exhibition,” he says with pride.</p> \n<p>On a typical day, Farage would be up at 6am, bright and perky for a breakfast of kippers at a nearby hotel. “Then we’d rendezvous at the office and decide what we want to do for the day, which would involve some walkabouts and a lot of knocking on doors. Then we’d maybe hit a pub for lunch. Then more walkabouts and more canvassing. Then another pint around 5 o’clock, go out and do more evening canvassing. Then around 9, we’d go to The Smugglers [pub] for dinner or we’d go to La Magnolia [an Italian] and have a nice civilised meal.”</p> \n<p>However, the entire Ukip team had failed to spot that Farage’s health difficulties – which led media commentators to note that the Ukip leader was tired and snappy at points in the campaign – were affecting his mood. “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/24/nigel-farageukip-sleeping-pills-back-pain\">None of us realised he had back problems,</a>” he says. “That was his fault. We all saw the way he looked during the Believe in Britain speech. I thought: ‘We’d been for a steam three days running so you don’t look sweaty. But you’re still sweating and look really uncomfortable.’ I couldn’t understand it.”</p> \n<p>Farage finally spoke out about his agonising pain a few weeks before polling day, and decided to scale back his schedule and concentrate his time mostly on winning South Thanet. In the end, he lost by around 2,000 votes, having been convinced right up until the day itself that he was about to enter parliament on his seventh attempt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b9cce539edfa5da175e405c505421d3a71e9ee0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433958213759/5115718e-49ae-4e86-8a83-92382d583031-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage faces the media after defeat.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage faces the media after defeat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We knew by 10 o’clock that we hadn’t done it,” Kassam says. “That morning, Nigel and I went to vote together, and we were both in good spirits. I was quietly confident, I knew it was so close ... But suddenly between 12 and 4 there were queues in Broadstairs, and I thought: Oh no, these people are not voting for us ... It got to around eight and the queues in Broadstairs hadn’t subsided and everywhere else had. I said that’s it. I had tears in my eyes and I was genuinely holding back tears for the next 48 hours. I don’t cry, but I was so sad, so deeply sad.”</p> \n<p>While the results rolled in, Farage was asleep, while Kassam and Bruni-Lowe slept in 30-minute shifts to keep abreast of the news. In the morning, they accompanied Farage to the declaration, knowing that he had lost.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/10/raheem-kassam-ukip-nigel-farage-rag-tag-unprofessional-embarrassing-people\">Raheem Kassam: 'rag-tag, unprofessional, embarrassing people' spoilt Ukip's election</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Within an hour, Farage had resigned, and Kassam still insists that the Ukip leader was relieved to be going – despite famously unresigning just four days later. Kassam will also not hear any criticism of the South Thanet campaign itself, which he boldly declares to have been the “single best campaign ever, ever in British politics, bar maybe the Bradford spring”. If it were not for the SNP, he says, the party would have won around five more seats.</p> \n<p>Kassam also takes umbrage at the claims that he was responsible for Farage repeatedly bringing up the issue of immigrants with HIV using NHS resources. O’Flynn was fully onside, he says, and was present in the spin room after Farage’s television debate, ready to brief the press on the issue. He also disputes the idea that this in any way deterred potential voters.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think there was anyone who was thinking of voting for us who was put off by that,” he says. “Don’t forget Labour voters aren’t who you think they are.

Which is not to say those words are badly written or otherwise lacking. Laurence Scott has set himself the formidable task of registering the impact of the new digital technologies on our cognition, our perception and our emotions; in short, our phenomenology in its broadest sense. Other pundits take on the political, economic and social changes occasioned by the world wide web and the internet – Scott busies himself with the existential ones. The four-dimensional humans of the book’s title are our wired selves, compelled increasingly to inhabit an environment in which the old certainties of space and time are being disrupted by a global network that abolishes distance and privileges instantaneousness.</p> \n<p>Besides the title, Scott devises other motifs to exemplify these transformations: the four-dimensional human, ever conscious of the clock ticking in the corner of the screen, looks through “a reverse peephole” into the homes of others. Airbnb encourages us to turn booking a night’s stay into a paradoxical form of intimacy: we may never meet the people who pimp their sheets to us, yet both parties know exactly where to find one another should those sheets be egregiously stained. The frontier era of cyberspace, was, Scott suggests, painfully short-lived: we set off pell-mell into the virtual new-found-land, gleefully abandoning the old strictures of gender, sexual orientation, class, age and ethnicity, only to find them catching up with us – and indeed being still more rigidly imposed by interests for whom it is essential our identities be defined, so they can sell us stuff we don’t need, but which they know we’ve bought in the past.</p> \n<p>If the vertiginous seesaw between seeming anonymity and actual surveillance (by both commercial and state apparatuses) typifies online life, then our communications within it have, Scott suggests, an equally Janus-faced character. One of the great strengths of this book is that its author offers himself up as the experimental rat in the virtual maze, analysing his own emotional responses to a life on social media. He writes of how in an era when everyone has the permanent possibility of communicating with just about anyone else, his own interactions with those actually present have become curiously stilted. He distinguishes between telephonic silences, which link us together “like a thick rope”, from Skype ones that, as we avoid our interlocutors’ eyes, only drive us further apart. Nowadays, he writes, the phrase “awkward silence” is utterly tautologous: all silences are awkward.</p> \n<p>Scott, who is a self-styled social media “loiterer”, rather than a compulsive tweeter, is particularly good on the ways four-dimensionality seems to queer our flesh-and-blood existence: the friend who continually updates their online profiles can seem oddly insubstantial and anachronistic in person; the fleeting real-life encounter can turn into a persistent virtual presence, hovering around our twittering timelines; while the deaths of casual acquaintances can gain huge salience, even as those of old friends are lost in a spume of pixels. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2011/jul/26/marshall-mcluhan-conservatism-medium-is-message\">Marshall McLuhan</a>’s much-trumpeted “global village” is, it transpires, not some <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/laurie-lee\">Laurie Lee</a> hamlet where everyone brings in the hay together, but a world-girdling Hollywood chock full of overdemonstrative divas. And, according to Scott, this is the virtual world at its best, because the confusions of scale and proportion are necessarily uncanny, making us only too aware of the trolls and stalkers who lurk about in the unearthly glow of light-emitting diodes.</p> \n<p>But if the capacity of the internet to unite us is deceptive, so are the apparent fluidity and diversity of our online existences. In a section that takes as its starting point Marx’s apercu in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/communist-manifesto-16.html\"><em>The Communist Manifesto</em></a> about the transformative power of capitalism, “All that is solid melts into air”, Scott argues that far from liberating us into a realm of vaporous reinvention, every web-surfer is “training to be a taxonomist”. The culture and operation of the web thrive on our willingness to point and click and view; Scott cites “cyber-philosopher” <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/jaron-lanier\">Jaron Lanier</a>, who coined the expression “virtual reality”, as the champion of “a sustainable global economy based primarily on exchanges of information” – namely all those clicks and likes and views – but he himself isn’t convinced. Perhaps too much of a cybernaut and an egalitarian to argue straightforwardly that the web banalises culture by bypassing the traditional gatekeepers, Scott instead wittily dissects the phenomenon of “Normcore”, seeing it as emblematic of a medium that relentlessly privileges novelty over originality.</p> \n<p>But really, as Lear observed to Cordelia (who clearly didn’t have an Amazon Prime account), nothing comes of nothing, and no “information economy” can ever topple the suzerainty of things. In some quite prosaic ways Scott is an ideal person to tackle this subject: he is in his mid-30s, and so reached adulthood before the inception of wireless broadband, the technological change that freeze-dried cyberspace into full, gelid existence. Moreover, he is both a creative writer and a perceptive literary critic, who leavens his text with some mercurially brilliant turns of phrase and poetic coinages, while at the same time stiffening it up with huge dollops of literary explication and quotation. There’s room in <em>The Four- Dimensional Human</em> for everything from Proust’s madeleine to Poe’s “<a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/fall-of-the-house-of-usher-and-other-writings.html\">The Fall of the House of Usher</a>”, and back again. The former is employed to discuss the web’s time- and memory-distorting capabilities; the latter as prescient of its simultaneous visibility and obscurity.</p> \n<p>I enjoyed Scott’s tropes, whether it was nailing the defining quality of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/katieprice\">Katie Price</a> (AKA Jordan) as “eternal nextness”, or describing the x-ray view of screened luggage as a Warholian “pastel fantasia”. And I appreciated the erudition, which brings the same degree of criticality to bear on <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/wings-of-the-dove.html\"><em>The Wings of the Dove</em></a> as an advert for Dove soap, without thereby implying any necessary equivalence. However, speaking with all the gravitas of my 53 years, and as not so much a digital immigrant but more of an away-dayer who takes short trips into cyberspace, I think Scott may not quite have the long view necessary to fully apprehend this epochal transformation in our terms of existence. In part, his scholarliness is responsible, making of him an oddly fusty zeitgeister, since he explains emergent technologies almost solely by reference to content derived from one – the codex, or physical books – that is increasingly redundant. Yet there is also a failure here to fix the phenomenon of digital media properly in a universal timeline, one that allows for other developments that have had just as radical effects.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"84fea63d9e7972a294cfd83ef2a95fce473d7b40\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433853866739/3072cca7-c6d0-4404-bc11-bf614587e204-281x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Scott describes the defining quality of Katie Price (AKA Jordan) as ‘eternal nextness’.\" width=\"281\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Scott describes the defining quality of Katie Price (AKA Jordan) as ‘eternal nextness’.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M Benett/Getty Images for truTV</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve often thought the virulence with which these technologies have battened on to human psyches is due to our already having been softened up. Really, the communications and media technologies that came to fruition in the late-19th and early-20th century already constituted an embryonic “world wide web”; many of the characteristics Scott attributes to his contemporary four-dimensional human were already evident in the city-dwellers of the recent past. High-speed transport links allowing for mechanised distribution systems, the telegraph, the telephone and radio were all in place by the late 1920s, while the roiling, jostling urban millstream was itself a spatial analogue of the cluttered screens that have subsequently come to fill our vision. Scott does understand the past has much to teach us, yet understandably he wants to make it new by privileging the novelty of the virtual; but, really, metropolitan existence, at once utterly anonymous and rigidly codified, while also imposing on us all sorts of spatial jump-cuts and temporal stitching, has been the truly transformative force in human affairs. The new media have – through their ubiquity and prevalence – finished the job by changing the physical city into an electro-physical network.</p> \n<p>Towards the end of this book Scott seems to lose his focus; shifting from forensic descriptions of web-heads’ perceptual and cognitive glitches into lengthier philosophising of the Whither goest thou? form. Unlike Bob Dylan’s Mr Jones, Scott sees there is something going on here but he has a fairly good idea of what it is: a sinister lock-step between humanity’s technological “advance” and its compulsive shitting in its own nest. He tries to stave off what he terms “the Demon of Melodramatic Prophesies” which can bedevil writing about the present, yet having already identified as intrinsic to virtual existence a collapsing of the future and the past into a permanently digitised “now”, he can’t avoid the doomsday intersection of human connectivity and environmental degradation.</p> \n<p>But this is a cop-out: seemingly even youngish literary types such as Scott cannot help being nostalgic for the quill, parchment and carrier pigeons they never knew; and would prefer extinction to any version of “the singularity” (the absorption of biological into machine intelligence) that may lie ahead of us. Which is a shame, because with his joyful phrase-making and sharp eye for the follies and absurdities of wired life, Scott would be the perfect investigator to report back on what it feels like to be … uploaded.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> To order<strong> </strong><em>The Four-Dimensional Human</em><strong> </strong>for &pound;16 (RRP &pound;20) go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/293721/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

lead characters are lowlifes, while men see them as heroes. He goes on to describe a sanitised, female-focused version of the film that would be less entertaining and compares the key differences between male and female friendship:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>When the Sex and the City girls sit around at brunch, they’re a tightly knit clique – but their rule is to always be sympathetic and supportive as each describes her problems, usually revolving around the men in her life.</p> \n <p>As GoodFellas shows us, guys hanging out together don’t really like to talk about the women in their lives because that’s too real.

On the one hand, it has made more people aware that gender is not as binary as many once believed. Yet discussions about transgenderism themselves are often conducted in harsh black and white. It has taken, of all unlikely folk, a member of the Kardashian clan to dropkick transgenderism into the mainstream. But amid all the carefully worded expressions of support for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/09/caitlyn-jenner-faces-new-lawsuit-over-fatal-car-crash\" title=\"\">Caitlyn Jenner </a>– previously known as Bruce – from President Obama to the Kardashians themselves, there is also dissent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/02/caitlyn-jenner-transgender-response-vanity-fair\">Caitlyn Jenner: transgender community has mixed reactions to Vanity Fair reveal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Last weekend the New York Times published a piece by Elinor Burkett about her <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/sunday/what-makes-a-woman.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">qualms over elements of transgenderism</a>. Her main contention was with Jenner’s belief – and by extension, all transgender women’s belief – that she <em>feels</em> more female than male. “People who haven’t lived their whole lives as women shouldn’t get to define us. That’s something men have been doing for much too long … They haven’t travelled through the world as women and been shaped by all that this entails,” she wrote. Burkett’s piece split liberal opinion, with some expressing relief that someone had vocalised their own feelings on the matter, and others disgust that the New York Times had, as one prominent news website put it, “<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/06/08/the_new_york_times_bungles_transgender_rights_what_its_caitlyn_jenner_op_ed_gets_wrong_about_feminism_and_gender_identity/\" title=\"\">bungled transgender rights</a>”. By and large the divide followed age lines, with those over 40 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetteMidler/status/607627409224003586\" title=\"\">taking Burkett’s side</a> and younger bloggers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/morninggloria/status/607977285216370688\" title=\"\">raging against her</a>.</p> \n<p>Burkett did bungle her argument. She compares a trans woman to a white man “using chemicals to change his skin pigmentation and crocheting his hair into twists, expecting to be embraced by the black community”. But comparing gender to race is a trope as tired as it is irrelevant. Her claim that “the insult and outright fear that trans men and women live with is all too familiar to [women]” is simply laughable. Second-wave feminists, of which Burkett is one, remember clearly the fights they led to liberate women from horrible constraints, and they did this so successfully that few women born after 1980 can imagine living under such constraints today. But at no point did western women endure the kind of&nbsp;marginalisation and <a href=\"https://www.glaad.org/tags/anti-transgender-violence\" title=\"\">risk of violence</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yspp.org/about_suicide/statistics.htm\" title=\"\">suicide</a> still suffered by so many trans people today.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It is a new world, that means questions will be asked, and that’s a good thing. It means people want to understand</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>If, as Burkett contends, a trans woman who has lived for most of their life as a man cannot understand what it feels like to be a woman, then a woman certainly has no idea what it feels like to be trans woman. And if a trans woman should not define what it means to be a woman, neither, really, should anyone as that path is paved with generalisations. Burkett’s list of sample experiences that make a woman (“the onset of their periods in the middle of a crowded subway”) is as reductive as the signifiers of femininity (cleavage and nail polish) Jenner references, which cause Burkett such rage. In any event, surely Jenner’s belief that she needs such accoutrements in order to look acceptably feminine could just as easily be cited as a near universal experience for women. As for the contention that trans women “undermine almost a century of hard-fought arguments that the very definition of female is a social construct that has subordinated us”, well, considering all that feminism has accomplished, I reckon it will probably survive Vanity Fair dressing up Caitlyn Jenner in a tight dress.</p> \n<p>But Burkett’s piece and the furore around it exemplify the problems in discussing trans issues. Among Burkett’s ultimately alienating rage and unhelpful analogies, she raises reasonable arguments, which is why her article struck a chord for so many. The mainstreaming of transgenderism is a new world, and that means questions will be asked, and that’s a good thing. It means people want to understand. What does Caitlyn Jenner, who became famous as an <a href=\"http://starcasm.net/archives/318494\" title=\"\">Olympic decathlete</a> – competing in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/29242699\" title=\"\">an event from which women are still excluded</a> – mean when she says she always felt more like a woman?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/16/fallon-fox-trans-mma-athlete-interview\">Fallon Fox on life as a trans athlete: 'The scope of vitriol and anger was mind-blowing'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And speaking of sport, how to carve out a space for transgender athletes such as Fallon Fox, a trans woman who is a mixed martial arts athlete and fights against women – some of whom have complained that Fallon, having been born a man, has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/16/fallon-fox-trans-mma-athlete-interview\" title=\"\">an inherent physical advantage</a>? These are reasonable questions, but they are, in certain quarters, shouted down by accusations that the questioner is transphobic or a “terf” (trans-exclusionary radical feminist), which is why Burkett’s article felt to some like&nbsp;the release of a pressure valve, for all its faults.</p> \n<p>Some feminists, including Burkett, say that the rush to embrace transgenderism after so many years of exclusion has slammed down any room for debate. Arguments from the more extremist fringes have not helped, such as when the activist Martha Plimpton was widely criticised last year for using the word “vagina” about a benefit for Texas abortion funding. To reference female genitalia, Plimpton was told, is “exclusionary” because trans women are born without one. But these extremist wings, while loud, are no more representative of the wider trans movement than the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2\" title=\"\">radical feminist events</a> that explicitly exclude trans women are reflective of feminism. Just as the experience of the hugely privileged and near universally praised Caitlyn Jenner, for that matter, is hardly representative of that of the average trans person.</p> \n<p>Among all the talk of Jenner’s bravery, questions should still be asked. Because perhaps the biggest irony to debates about the trans movement is that, while they get bogged down too often in one-upmanship, academic posturing and hysteria, the growing acceptance of&nbsp;trans people themselves shows a realisation of an underlying truth: we&nbsp;are all just humans.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d09a2d9224826f54fa5174e0550df4820be230f4/160_0_4179_2508/4179.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2508,"width":4179,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Richard

publishing women to redress “gender bias” in the literary world.</p> \n<p>The novelist made what she called her “provocation” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/05/kamila-shamsie-2018-year-publishing-women-no-new-books-men\">in Saturday’s Guardian</a>, revealing that just under 40% of books submitted to the Booker prize over the past five years were by women, and pointing to everything from the <a href=\"http://nicolagriffith.com/2015/05/26/books-about-women-tend-not-to-win-awards/\">author Nicola Griffith’s research</a>, which found that far more prize-winning novels have male than female protagonists, to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/apr/07/male-writers-continue-dominate-literary-criticism-vida-study-finds\">Vida statistics </a>showing that male authors and reviewers command more space than female.</p> \n<p>“At this point, I’m going to assume that the only people who really doubt that there is a gender bias going on are those who stick with the idea that men are better writers and better critics,” wrote Shamsie. “Enough. Across the board, enough ... I would argue that is time for everyone, male and female, to sign up to a concerted campaign to redress the inequality ... Why not have a year of publishing women: 2018, the centenary of women over the age of 30 getting the vote in the UK, seems appropriate.”</p> \n<p>And Other Stories, the literary press that uses a network of readers to source its titles, has become the first publisher to accept the challenge. “I think we can do it,” said publisher Stefan Tobler. “And if we don’t do it, what is going to change?”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/05/kamila-shamsie-2018-year-publishing-women-no-new-books-men\">Kamila Shamsie: let’s have a year of publishing only women – a provocation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A small publisher, And Other Stories releases 10 to 12 new titles a year. “We’ve realised for a while that we’ve published more men than women,” said Tobler. “This year we’ve done seven books by men and four by women ... We have a wide range of people helping us with our choices, and our editors are women ... and yet somehow we still publish more books by men than women.”</p> \n<p>Tobler’s colleague Sophie Lewis, a senior editor at And Other Stories, said she expected the team would be “rescheduling male writers’ books for other years [and] digging harder and further than usual, in order to find the really good women’s writing that we want to publish” in 2018.</p> \n<p>But the main thing she wants to do over the course of the year is “to examine the selection and promotion process, the production of their books from commissioning to reader’s bedside”. </p> \n<p>“By taking on the challenge we will expose our systems and the paths of recommendation and investigation that brings books to us, and we will end up becoming a kind of small-scale model for a much bigger inquiry about why women’s writing is consistently sidelined or secondary, the poor cousin rather than the equal of men’s writing,” said Lewis.</p> \n<p>“Personally, I’d rather not think about it. Why should we have to? Surely great writing will out? It seems not – or it seems so consistently that women’s writing makes it less often that we have to doubt the fairness of the systems in place. So it will be worth carrying out a year of publishing only women in order to document the difficulties involved.” </p> \n<p>Tobler said he “hoped other publishers would join in”, but while literary agent Clare Alexander praised Shamsie for “purposefully being an agent provocateur”, she said it was unlikely that the UK’s larger publishers would commit to publishing only women.</p> \n<p>“But it’s a consciousness-raising thing,” she said. “I do think this country defaults male, given half a chance, so we have to have some conscious corrective. It can’t just be left to the Baileys once a year. We need a climate of positive thinking.” </p> \n<p>Shamsie said that she had been “struck” after publication of her essay “by the number of people who’ve assured me that they know I was just trying to start a conversation and didn’t intend anyone to take a Year of Publishing Women seriously”.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t know that myself (surely radicalism has to be the only way to take on such entrenched power structures) but was beginning to be convinced by everyone else’s conviction when And Other Stories (headed by a man it should be said) came along and said, ‘OK, we’re in,’” said the acclaimed novelist.</p> \n<p>While Shamsie is “sure there are a lot of people within publishing who have been rolling their eyes at the whole article”, she said she has “only heard about that secondhand or by reading between the lines of conversation or noticing certain obvious silences”, with those getting in touch with her “largely positive”.</p> \n<p>“By positive, I don’t only mean those who agree that a year of publishing women is a good idea but also those who say you’re right to point out there’s a problem but here are other ways to address it,” she said. “So there’ve been a host of interesting suggestions: a women in literature festival; a commitment to ‘genderless’ covers for novels; a strategy to specifically address the gender imbalance of books submitted for literary prizes. All of which sound good to me – we need as many suggestions as possible to counter the depth and breadth of the problem.”</p> \n<p>Griffith, who has led a call for more research into books submitted for literary prizes, and their subject matter, agreed, saying that the “more ideas about how to push back against the problem, the better”. </p> \n<p>“This is a huge problem for all of us, however we identify, gender-wise. Half the people in the world aren’t being listened to, and this has an impact on <em>all</em> the people. We all need to pay attention to this, and find a long-term solution,” she said.</p> \n<p>After analysing the winners of six major literary prizes over the past 15 years – and concluding that “women seem to have literary cooties” – Griffith is now trying to coordinate the “incredible” response to her initial blog post, which has seen “dozens” of people coming forward and volunteering to parse other literary awards.</p> \n<p>Shamsie’s solution “isn’t the front I choose to commit to ... but I can see how it would be useful for others,” Griffith said. “My only caveat is that this could be used to solidify battle lines, sharpen the us-versus-them attitude, which I’m not sure is the most useful approach.”</p> \n<p>“Provocation,” added the novelist, “is one way to bring attention to the problem.
