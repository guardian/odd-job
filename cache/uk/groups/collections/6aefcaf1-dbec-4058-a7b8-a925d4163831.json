Her career-long interest is in documenting disappearing cultural practices, and in 2005 she got chatting to a Shanghai taxi driver about foot binding. “He mentioned that his grandmother had bound feet,” Farrell recalls. “Most people told me that it was such an old tradition, there were no women left. I went to the village of the cab driver’s grandmother, in the Shandong province, and met Zang Yun Ying. She became the first woman in my project.”</p> \n<p>What followed was a nine-year journey across China, tracking down the last survivors of foot binding. She found just 50 women. Five of them were still completely bound and in hiding, but most had released their binds. All were from impoverished villages in the provinces of Yunnan and Shandong. The oldest, Zhang Yun Ying, was 103. Farrell’s photobook<em> </em>Living History: Bound Feet Women of China, contains close-up portraits of the severe deformity they suffered. </p> \n<p>Foot binding was outlawed in China 103 years ago, following almost 10 decades of the practice. But the last factory producing “lotus shoes” – the triangular embroidered platforms used to showcase the women’s minuscule pointy feet – closed just six years ago.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The first year is particularly excruciating because the girls had to walk until their toes would break</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Jo Farrell</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>To create the desirable “lotus feet”, first made fashionable under Emperor Li Yu in the 10th century, women would have their toes taped together tightly into triangular points. The feet were beaten, cast in herbs and oils to loosen the skin and strapped into lotus shoes.</p> \n<p>After foot binding was banned it became taboo, and in 1950 Chairman Mao ordered anti foot-binding inspectors to publicly shame any bound women they found. “It was considered an old tradition that did not reflect modern China and should be stopped,” Farrell tells me from her flat in Hong Kong. “Their binding would be hung in windows so that people would laugh at them.”</p> \n<p>Most women were bound at the age of seven. “The first year is particularly excruciating because the girls were made to walk until their toes would break under their weight,” says Farrell. “After that, the toes became numb and now, 50 or 60 years later, they don’t have any pain in their feet. It’s all quite numb.”</p> \n<p>Farrell insists her photo series isn’t meant to sensationalise, but to educate us about a little-known custom. She admits she was surprised by her own reaction to seeing bound feet close up. “The first time I met Zang Yun Ying and held her foot in my hand it was just incredible – so soft and so incredibly formed.” </p> \n<p>In spite of the brutality the project lays bare, its message is one of hope, survival and grit. “In Chinese society, it was the only way forward for women,” says Farrell. “They did it because they thought it would give them a better future, a better life.”</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434121608799/ca15b537-7b9c-44c2-a9d8-d510c1cd1b38-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jo Farrell","altText":"Zhang Yun Ying, 10 in 2014, Shandong Province","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jo Farrell"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T06:00:22Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T09:06:16Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":21,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Art and design","Culture","China","Photography","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","webTitle":"Art and design"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China"},{"id":"artanddesign/photography","webTitle":"Photography"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"artanddesign"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"artanddesign"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/jun/15/the-last-women-in-china-with-bound-feet","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49mty","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/artanddesign/2015/jun/15/the-last-women-in-china-with-bound-feet","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/15/the-last-women-in-china-with-bound-feet"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434121503953/774e2eab-a8e6-4d5f-972b-7a118c03e89d-2060x1030.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1030,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Si Yin Zhin, who was aged 90 years old in 2011, had her feet bound.

It was, according to Cesar, a “stupid, stupid tackle” that Rooney apparently inflicted on him in England’s 3-1 win at Wembley, though he insisted he was not after revenge in the return game in Ljubljana. “On the pitch I am very aggressive and I enjoy the fight in physical games, but I don’t want to kill him.” He did, however, leave his calling card in the form of the forearm smash into the side of Rooney’s head during England’s 3-2 win and, putting aside for one moment the story of England’s captain and Sir Bobby Charlton’s goals record, that was a moment to demonstrate why the Manchester United player is now entrusted with the armband.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/wayne-rooney-strength-character-roy-hodgson-england\">Wayne Rooney’s character lauded by Roy Hodgson after England win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Roy Hodgson made the same point after Rooney had moved alongside Gary Lineker on 48 England goals, one short of Charlton with the usual turkey-shoot against San Marino conveniently timed in September to help him get over the line. “Wayne Rooney’s performance says a lot of things about him as a man,” Hodgson said. “Just before he took that chance he took a nasty blow from an elbow, which could have decked many a player and led to him losing his discipline. It didn’t and he got up. I like what that shows, and the fact that one or two chances had gone begging but when the ball fell to him he still stuck it away with aplomb. We can rely on that man.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457160825__\n</div> \n<p>In the buildup to this match, Rooney had talked about speaking to Ross Barkley at the end of a difficult season for the Everton midfielder and discussing with his fellow Liverpudlian the areas of his game that needed to improve. Rooney was not everyone’s choice to take over from Steven Gerrard as England captain but in his first year in the role he has scored eight goals in ten games, not been booked once and is yet to be on a losing side. These are still relatively early days but he has taken on the captaincy with distinction so far. <strong>Daniel Taylor</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/slovenia-england-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report\">Match report: Slovenia 2-3 England</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/wayne-rooney-strength-character-roy-hodgson-england\">Rooney’s character lauded by Hodgson</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/14/jack-wilshere-no-regrets-england-thunderbolts\">Dominic Fifield on Jack Wilshere’s impressive display</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>2) Maloney is Scotland’s man of this qualifying campaign</h2> \n<p>Gordon Strachan’s elation over the goal which hauled Scotland back into the game against the Republic of Ireland was matched only by the manager’s delight about the man who helped to provide it. Shaun Maloney has always been an independent thinker and occasionally an over-thinker. His is a career which continues to yield marquee moments, a matter apparently not impacted by his decision to continue his career in Major League Soccer. Maloney could quite easily have remained in England when departing Wigan Athletic last summer but fancied a fresh challenge. The attacker is Scotland’s man of this Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. He has consistently been the one to make things happen. When emerging as youth players at Celtic, it was generally accepted that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/aiden-mcgeady-ireland-scotland\">Aiden McGeady was of superior talent</a> to Maloney but the latter’s work ethic and attitude continues to reward him. He has also battled serious injury to remain prominent for club and country; few would merit a trip to a major tournament more. <strong>Ewan Murray</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/republic-of-ireland-scotland-euro-2016-group-d-match-report\">Match report: Republic of Ireland 1-1 Scotland </a><br /><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/13/martin-oneill-ireland-scotland-european-championship-qualifier\">Ewan Murray: O’Neill now faces battle to stop career petering out</a><br /><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span></strong> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/fai-shred-match-programmes-containing-john-delaney-fifa-criticism\">FAI shreds 18,000 match programmes with Delaney Fifa comments</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457155803__\n</div> \n<h2>3) Republic look out of date compared to Scotland</h2> \n<p>At the end of the 19th century “the Scottish style” meant something very specific: passing football, combination play, teamwork, as showcased for admiring crowds by the “Scotch Professors” in the first ever series of international matches against England. Ireland and Scotland’s 1-1 draw at the Aviva Stadium on Saturday was a messy game but a decent result for the Scots, who have looked throughout the campaign the more accomplished of the two teams. Shaun Maloney, James Morrison, Steven Naismith and Scott Brown may not be quite professor-level just yet. But even in a scruffy game there was confirmation in Dublin that Gordon Strachan – who is himself approaching national treasure status – has assembled a team that might not ever threaten to reach the final stages of Euro 2016 but which would at least look it was playing the same game as the best teams there.</p> \n<p>Against Ireland Scotland passed the ball well enough, crafted some nice triangles on the flanks and generally looked most comfortable playing a technically sound pass-and-move game. Should they fail to qualify from here they will do so in the knowledge that they have at least been pushing in the right direction, whereas much of the gloom around Ireland’s current trajectory is a sense that the basic method is simply a little out of date. Maloney was the most eye-catching player in midfield on Saturday, scorer now of five goals in qualifying and a fine all-round playmaking presence. Scotland may be two or three really good players (at least one of them a high class striker) away from being a top quality team. But Maloney and his fellow ball-playing midfielders would certainly add to the gaiety of a major tournament. Even in the fury of Dublin the glimpses in this qualifying campaign of a more historically Scottish Style have been a pleasure to watch. <strong>Barney Ronay</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/republic-of-ireland-martin-oneill-advantage-scotland\"><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> O’Neill claims Scotland’s Naismith ‘refereed the game</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2>4) Coleman has discovered a match-winning blend</h2> \n<p>The headlines, inevitably, were commandeered by Gareth Bale, who inspired Wales to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/jun/12/wales-v-belgium-european-2016-qualifier-live\">1-0 win over Belgium</a> last Friday. It was not just his decisive goal, rather the confidence that he spread among his teammates. Yet this momentous effort, which set Wales fair for the Euro 2016 finals – and their first appearance at a major championship since 1958 – was characterised by a collective thou-shalt-not-pass attitude.</p> \n<p>It has underpinned the campaign so far. Chris Coleman, who deserves huge credit for the turnaround he has overseen, has watched his team concede only two goals, and neither Andorra’s penalty nor Cyprus’ slightly streaky free-kick were from open play. This was Belgium’s second blank against Wales and although they exerted pressure, they were unable to create too much of clear-cut note.</p> \n<p>Led by the indomitable Ashley Williams, Wales put bodies on the line and kept Belgium’s highly-rated attackers at arm’s length. But it was not just the defence since Bale and the midfielders worked tirelessly, too. Coleman keeps getting his tactics and organisation spot on. With Bale at the other end, it is a winning blend. <strong>David Hytner</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/wales-belgium-euro-2016-qualifying-match-report\">Match report: Wales 1-0 Belgium</a><br /><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/12/gareth-bale-wales-belgium-inspirational\">Bale proves full value with inspirational display for Wales </a><br /><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/chris-coleman-wales-belgium-euro-2016\">Coleman: ‘We have to stop thinking of ourselves as little old Wales</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-68b405db-b421-47a1-ad2c-a04b2e3c99a5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434355030476/61c92a66-e4ce-47f0-8d38-fd292b65c1de-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gareth Bale and Wales team-mates celebrate Bale's 25th-minute goal against Belgium\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gareth Bale and Wales team-mates celebrate the deciding goal against Belgium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Glyn Kirk/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>5) Wilmots leaves himself open</h2> \n<p>Before the tie with Wales, the Belgium manager, Marc Wilmots, insisted that all of the talk about his future – and that of many of his players – had been parked. The focus was exclusively on Wales. Yet on the day of the game, he became embroiled in a remarkable row. Wilmots had been tipped to take over at Schalke, having held talks with the Bundesliga club and he said that he would talk publicly about his future after the Wales game.</p> \n<p>Yet Schalke moved first, announcing that they had appointed Andr&eacute; Breitenreiter to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/26/roberto-di-matteo-resigns-schalke-coach-disagreement-club\">replace Roberto Di Matteo</a>, who resigned in May. Wilmots was furious and he immediately made his feelings known in an interview with Kicker. “To announce such a thing just hours before our crucial Euro 2016 qualifier is incredible and really bad form,” Wilmots said. “Schalke approached me, which is why it’s a bad joke when they make out now that they have turned me down.”</p> \n<p>Toby Alderweireld, the Belgium defender, told the Guardian that Wilmots had addressed his future with the players beforehand. “He told us before the game that he is staying,” Alderweireld said. Had the issue been a distraction? “No,” Alderweireld said. “As a group, we were focused on the result.” The subsequent defeat, however, gave Wilmots’ critics plenty of ammunition. <strong>DH</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/12/belgium-fans-trust-satnav-end-up-in-wrong-wales\">Belgium fans trust sat nav and end up in the wrong Wales</a></p> \n</blockquote> \n<h2><strong>6) </strong>Northern Ireland architects of their own fate</h2> \n<p>Flinty Northern Ireland have finally vaulted a major psychological hurdle, as Saturday’s battling draw at home to Romania positions them nicely for Euro 2016 automatic qualification by September. The visit of Anghel Iordanescu’s side presented a stern test of character. And Northern Ireland’s industry, constantly compressing space for the group leaders, outlined a steadfast capacity to mix it when their normal, crisp, passing approach and fluidity along the channels to lone forward Kyle Lafferty starts to malfunction. Michael O’Neill’s men are now the architects of their own fate. Victories over Faroe Islands and Hungary will spirit them towards France. It helps that the Hungarians, two points adrift of Northern Ireland in third place, must play their Romanian rivals next. O’Neill’s job could get so much easier. If Lafferty, Steven Davis – “the brain of Northern Ireland” according to Iordanescu - and Jonny Evans, Northern Ireland’s best performers at the weekend, remain fit, it would be even better news. All three retain a solid presence which unquestionably carries the whole squad to greater heights and horizons. <strong>Julian Taylor</strong></p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/northern-ireland-romania-euro-2016-qualifying-match-report\">Match report: Northern Ireland 0-0 Romania</a></p> \n</blockquote>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434354121764/0095edf5-d6a7-463a-86d2-862c816330b1-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty/Action/PA/Euro 2016 qualifiers talking points","altText":"Euro 2016 qualifiers","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty/Action/PA/Euro 2016 qualifiers talking points"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434139394424/Gareth-Bale-and-Wales-tea-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gareth Bale and Wales team-mates celebrate the deciding goal against Belgium.

My ears are ringing and my head is held in the vice-like grip of safety gear more suited to a spaceship.</p> \n<p>But what I’m actually wearing is a cycling helmet. It’s a <a href=\"http://www.hovding.com/\">H&ouml;vding</a>, an “airbag for cyclists”, invented in Sweden and billed as the helmet for people who don’t like wearing helmets. The H&ouml;vding promises superior protection in a crash without the need to actually put anything on your head.</p> \n<p>My “crash” was simulated for the camera’s benefit, but still I’m surprised by the drama of it all. The H&ouml;vding incorporates a lot of scientific research and a sophisticated algorithm that stops it going off unnecessarily, so to activate it I had to throw myself at the ground, headfirst. Moments before impact there was a loud bang, then there I was on the ground, stunned, wrapped in a hard white balloon.</p> \n<p>I’m one of those cyclists who never wears a helmet. I justify this to myself by pointing to the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f3817?ijkey=I5vHBog6FhaaLzX&amp;keytype=ref#ref-9\">ongoing controversy</a> over whether they actually help. Some studies have suggested helmets encourage both riders and drivers to take more risks, <a href=\"http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/articles/releases/overtaking110906.html\">and one study</a> suggested that cyclists wearing helmets are more likely to be involved in collisions with passing vehicles. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOolESrCcBw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NOolESrCcBw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet the statistics can’t really counter my belief that, if I knew for sure I was going to crash, I’d rather be protected than not. When I started cycling I always wore one, but after several years without ever calling on it I started to leave it behind. Not because of vanity, I hasten to say. It’s not a head of carefully groomed hair I’m trying to protect. Rather it’s the hassle of having one more thing to carry once I’m off the bike. To the cinema, in restaurants, at the supermarket. Add to this the discomfort of a sweaty head covered in plastic and polystyrene in summer and it doesn’t seem worth it. So would a H&ouml;vding change my mind? In its resting state, the H&ouml;vding fits round your neck a bit like a scarf. It’s heavier than it looks, with a battery, airbag and all that Swedish technology inside. You need to keep it charged and switch it on when you set off.</p> \n<p>It’s a bit cumbersome off the bike, pulled backwards by the weight at the back, but when you’re cycling and leaning forward it’s fairly unobtrusive. I was expecting looks of admiration and envy at the traffic lights as other cyclists noticed my sophisticated piece of kit – but no one seemed to pay it any attention.</p> \n<p>I wouldn’t want to wear it off the bike, though, so it doesn’t really solve the problems I have with helmets. It’s a bit easier to carry around than a bog standard one as it can be folded and put in a (largish) bag, but not much. And at &pound;249 you certainly won’t be leaving it on your bike. Then there’s the heat – it might keep you warm in winter but having a chunky scarf around your neck in hot weather is not going to be pleasant.</p> \n<p>I did notice I felt safer with it on, though. I have a rule about not wearing headphones when cycling, but with the H&ouml;vding I broke that a few times, listening to music on my way home from work. It was great, but perhaps confirms those suggestions about taking extra risks if you think you’re protected.</p> \n<p>And since the H&ouml;vding can only be used once – although if you’re involved in an accident they will sell you a replacement for &pound;99 – I probably won’t be splashing out any time soon. If, however, the crash hadn’t been simulated and the device had saved my life, &pound;249 might seem cheap at the price.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433777000542/Judith-Soal-wears-the-inf-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Judith Soal wears the inflated Hovding bike airbag following her simulated crash in north London.

In the onscreen demo shown during the event, the player shoots through a furnace-like space base, blasting demons into pieces with the shotgun, then punching their heads off or stamping them in the brains. Blasting at barrels causes collateral explosions, which take out reams of enemies in one blossoming ignition. Players are even able to grasp and pull apart the skulls of downed enemies, while chainsaws can be used to slice through their limbs and chests.</p> \n<p>But most intriguingly, the game is set to ship with Doom Snapmap, an intuitive editor mode. Players will be able to design and build their own multiplayer maps using a simple grid-based system, as well as applying different game types such as co-op horde and classic four-player deathmatch. With one button participants can then play or share new maps online.</p> \n<p>There look to be plenty more nods to old school Doom, including the famous door opening sounds, familiar demon types, and armour and health pick ups.

But is it community clean-ups or strict municipal laws that have the most success in making a city spotless?</p>","byline":"Adrian Mourby","body":"<p>Definitions of cleanliness can, of course, be very different across the world. I’ve seen people spitting on pristine streets in China, and broken pots left to decay neatly by the roadside in Africa. Monaco provides dispensers with free bags for cleaning up after your dog, but some visitors are surprised to see the used bags just lying in the gutter. This however is the Monegasque way: they must wait there until collection.</p> \n<p>According to the 2014 Mercer Global Financial list of the <a href=\"http://www.miratelinc.com/blog/10-cleanest-cities-in-the-world\">world’s cleanest cities</a>, Calgary, Canada’s oil capital was top of the cleanliness pile, followed by Adelaide, Honolulu, Minneapolis and Kobe. </p> \n<p>To anyone who travels much to Europe, it might seem odd there’s not a single Swiss city in the top 10. Ultra-calm Zurich has been Mercer’s second-best city for <a href=\"http://www.mercer.com/content/mercer/global/all/en/newsroom/2014-quality-of-living-survey.html\">quality of life</a> for years (Calgary comes in a lowly 33rd in the life stakes) but it figures nowhere on the cleanliness list. </p> \n<p>The Mercer study is based on five hygiene-based factors: the availability and drinkability of water, waste removal, quality of sewage systems, air pollution, and traffic congestion. Curiously litter, a very visible indicator of cleanliness, is not considered at all.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>By 2020, Calgary intends to divert 80% of its waste away from landfills</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99d0befb06734881d0b4545353aee82b8855d552\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434033273024/80cc8db6-77d7-412f-af4c-438d07aca0f9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"According to one study, Calgary – Canada’s oil capital – is the cleanest city in the world.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">According to one study, Calgary – Canada’s oil capital – is the cleanest city in the world.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Rose/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To be fair, Calgary can also boast litter-free streets. <a href=\"http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/litterbugs-reminded-of-hefty-fines-1.952334\">Thousand-dollar fines</a> for dropping cigarette butts or throwing rubbish out of a car window have had a positive impact on the city. But for Mercer, Calgary ranks top of the list due to its green initiatives. As well as following Alberta’s <a href=\"http://esrd.alberta.ca/waste\">Too Good to Waste</a> programme, which aims to decrease how much waste is sent to landfill, environmental charity <a href=\"http://www.greencalgary.org/\">Green Calgary</a> also promotes a greener lifestyle for Calgarians by offering tips on everything from improving your composting to how to pack a litter-less lunch. The organisation, which has been in operation since 1978, also “seeks to empower Calgarians to create healthy homes and communities through environmental education, products and services”. By 2020 the city intends to divert 80% of its waste away from landfills.</p> \n<p>Yet when it comes to awarding marks for effort, spotless Singapore really should score high on any list given the way it enforces cleanliness and tidiness. The island city-state has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/jan/05/the-price-of-life-in-singapore-city-of-rules-its-a-faustian-deal\">draconian laws about many things</a>, from pornography to tipping. In the 1960s, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew introduced strict anti-litter laws, which are still in force today. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3b114f60c00dfaf855e6adeace76cbb407c47149\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433762920426/932b0453-8e0c-44d8-8e0f-01bd1f5781df-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Singapore signs.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Singapore says ‘no’ – a lot.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bildagentur-online/Schoening/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Anyone convicted of dropping litter can be fined up to S$1,000 (&pound;480) for the first conviction. Repeat convictions cost up to $5,000, and may lead to a community service orders or anti-littering lectures (only given in Chinese), to curb repeat offenders. In the case of a third offence, law-breakers may be made to wear a sign reading “I am a litter lout”.</p> \n<p>Singapore also fines people for putting spent chewing gum anywhere other than a bin ($100), for urinating in lifts ($500), and for failing to flush a public lavatory ($100). Spot checks are regularly made by police officers in public toilet cubicles – there is no point having a law if it’s not enforced.<br /></p> \n<p>The result of these fines is plain to see: Singapore is a very clean and tidy island state, albeit one that has also sacrificed certain civil liberties (and, perhaps, a certain amount of creativity). That said, it would take a very dyed-in-the-wool libertarian to fight for the right to pee in an elevator. </p> \n<p>There are less punitive ways to be clean and tidy, however. Kigali, the capital of Rwanda, seems to have achieved a clean and litter-free environment without the threat of harsh fines. Not on any of Mercer’s lists, modern Kigali isn’t exactly beautiful. It rises up on a tree-covered slope and is mainly built of concrete, but the level of upkeep is extraordinary.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the city’s roundabouts are so well-swept and the grass so well-maintained that wedding couples sprint across the traffic to be photographed in the middle of them. Unusually, this has been achieved not through punishment, but by the principle of <em>Umuganda</em>. This <a href=\"http://www.rwandapedia.rw/explore/umuganda\">word has many meanings</a> relating to “community” and “payment”, and dates back before Rwanda was part of Belgium’s African empire.</p> \n<p>In the 19th century, a number visitors recorded that Rwandans were required to work two days a week for their community leader and during Belgian rule <em>Umuganda</em> was encouraged as a way of bolstering civic responsibility. In the years before the 1994 genocide, President Juv&eacute;nal Habyarimana emphasised it as part of his concept of “true” Rwandan identity. “True Rwandans” provided free labour for state-led projects like school building, road works, the construction of sanitation facilities and digging of anti-erosion ditches. Unfortunately Habyarimana’s true Rwandans, by extension, also belonged to the Hutu tribe, and <em>Umuganda</em> eventually became caught up in ideas of racial purity.<br /></p> \n<p>After taking office in 2000, President <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/paul-kagame\">Paul Kagame</a> harnessed <em>Umuganda</em> to help clean up his gun and shell-strewn capital, as well as to promote the idea of a cohesive national identity through communal projects. Under Kagame, <em>Umuganda</em> was formalised as a collective event on the last Saturday in each month when traffic – including airport taxis – is stopped for three hours in the morning, and the city comes together to tidy up. This can be problematic if you have a flight to catch. This day is called <em>umunsi w’umuganda</em> (contribution made by the community) and all able-bodied people between the ages of 18 and 65 are required by law to participate. The knock-on effect of such conscientious cleaning up is, of course, that people are less inclined to drop litter in the first place. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aadd27c4f66e45085c867e8d5fc7efb1092c68f8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433864860895/80f48348-12b9-4eaf-91dd-bd18b329a7c6-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"People participate in the monthly clean-up day, Umuganda, in Kigali.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People participate in Kigali’s monthly clean-up day, where all able-bodied people aged 18-65 are required to participate. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stuart Forster/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Significantly, although President Kagame is known for his toughness, no one I spoke to in Kigali was aware of penalties for dropping litter in their city. It simply is not something that occurs. People will tell you with great pride that their city is “cleaner than New York and London”, and the army of poorly-paid female cleaners who seek out litter and tend the grass consider this work their patriotic duty.</p> \n<p>“When foreign people come to this city and later return to their countries exclaiming about our city’s cleanliness, that itself motivates me to keep doing my work even better,” says Th&eacute;odosia Vuganeza of the Ikondera Women’s Cleaning Cooperative.</p> \n<p>The mayor of Kigali is now introducing cleanliness and hygiene awareness lessons into primary schools, taking his cue from <a href=\"http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/article/2015-05-22/189016/\">President Kagame’s assertion</a> that Kigali does not need international aid “to keep its backyards clean”.</p> \n<p>The cleanliness of Kigali is a pleasing rebuttal to Forbes’ list, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2007/04/16/worlds-cleanest-cities-biz-logistics-cx_rm_0416cleanest.html\">which declared in 2007</a> that the cleanest cities in the world were “largely located in countries noted for their democracy and their industrialisation” and that there are “no top-25 clean cities in South or Central America, Africa and Australia”. The magazine concluded “clean may also mean well-off”.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/may/26/what-is-safest-city-in-the-world-crime-immigration-tokyo-amsterdam-new-york-bogota\">Which is the safest city in the world?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But in less affluent countries, voluntary clean-ups may be the coming thing. Dar es Salaam in Tanzania is one of 91 cities worldwide to take part <a href=\"http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/international-coastal-cleanup\">International Coastal Cleanup Day</a>, which involved ridding beaches of litter and waste. The Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, neither of them wealthy states, are also among the list of countries <a href=\"http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/international-coastal-cleanup/images/2014-data-release/full-res/top-10-countries.jpg\">playing a key role</a> in the coastal cleanup. This year’s volunteers cleared <a href=\"http://www.oceanconservancy.org/our-work/international-coastal-cleanup/2015-by-the-numbers.html\">16 million pounds</a> of garbage from beaches around the world.<br /></p> \n<p>So, if Singapore is proof that cleanliness can be achieved by legislation, Kigali and Dar es Salaam are definitely proof that motivation and communal spirit can work as well. Calgary, on the other hand, falls somewhere between the two. It’s also the least interesting of the three cities to visit – but that’s a whole other list. </p> \n<p>Finally one has to ask, does it matter? Last year a Ugandan looking at Kigali told me wistfully that Kampala used to be as pristine as Kigali: “Why can’t we keep our capital clean and tidy anymore?”</p> \n<p>So, if you live there I think it matters, very much.</p>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434033051922/e8445776-1adc-45ca-ba12-d802a20d71f4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Gilks/Alamy","altText":"Painting the curbs of Kigali, Rwanda.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Gilks/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434033274571/80cc8db6-77d7-412f-af4c-438d07aca0f9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"According to one study, Calgary – Canada’s oil capital – is the cleanest city in the world.
