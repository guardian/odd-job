It’s estimated that more than 8,000 Bosniaks (Bosnian Muslims) were rounded up by soldiers from the Republika Srpska and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/04/how-britain-and-us-abandoned-srebrenica-massacre-1995\" title=\"\">killed in and around the town of Srebrenica</a>. Deemed an act of genocide, it was a war crime that came to symbolise the ugliness of the ethnic disputes that set the Balkans aflame in the 1990s.</p> \n<p>But amid the fighting and chaos that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia there were other sorts of war crimes that, while not as murderous, represented a particularly humiliating and psychologically damaging form of violence. Somewhere between 20,000 and 30,000 Bosnian women are thought to have been victims of militarised or systematic rape during the three-year conflict.</p> \n<p>“Women were often deliberately kept in detention until it was too late to get an abortion,” says Belma Becirbasic, an award-winning writer&nbsp;and activist in the area. “Some of those who gave birth to babies murdered them and&nbsp;many abandoned them immediately after. Women were&nbsp;reluctant to speak out about the&nbsp;suffering&nbsp;they’d endured. Most still remain silent due to the fear that the perpetrators would&nbsp;not be punished, but mostly out of the shame of being shunned in a highly patriarchal&nbsp;society.”</p> \n<p>Although abuses took place on all sides, the bulk of rapes in Bosnia were perpetrated by Bosnian Serb armies and militias and the large majority of the victims were Muslim women. How many children were born as a result is again a statistic that is unknown. “Rumours have been extraordinary,” says Becirbasic, “going from several hundred to several hundreds of thousands.”</p> \n<p>She warns that exaggeration of victims on both sides has been a central tactic in maintaining ethno-nationalist hostilities. As Charli Carpenter writes in her book, <a href=\"http://cup.columbia.edu/book/forgetting-children-born-of-war/9780231151306\" title=\"\"><em>Forgetting Children Born of War</em></a>, rape-related pregnancies became a “staple trope in media accounts of the war”, with reporters competing to find newsworthy female victims. But that doesn’t mean that there weren’t plenty of cases of children born from violent conception.</p> \n<p>One such child was Alen Muhic. He was born in Gorazde hospital in 1993. “When I heard him cry,” his distraught mother later said, “I asked the doctor to bring him to me. I wanted to strangle him.” But she didn’t kill her son. Rather, she abandoned him in the hospital and walked out of his life, apparently forever. The hospital workers took pity on the child and one of them, Muharem Muhic, the hospital caretaker, who had a wife and two daughters of his own to look after, decided to adopt the baby boy.</p> \n<p>For the first 10 years of his life, Muhic lived in happy obscurity, ignorant of the details of his conception and the identity of his real parents. Instead, he believed he was the son of Muharem and his wife, Advija, and brother to their daughters. Then one day in 2003, the story goes, Muhic got involved in a playground fight and his angry opponent told him that he was a “Chetnik bastard” – Chetnik is a derogatory term for a Serb, a reference to the nationalist Serbian militia active during the second world war – and that he was&nbsp;adopted.</p> \n<p>Around the same time as this incident Muhic met a film director named Semsudin Gegic who happened to know his biological mother. According to the director, the meeting was a coincidence: he was filming on the land of Muhic’s adoptive parents and the boy independently approached him to make a film about his life. The film Gegic made, in 2004, was called <em>A Boy From a War Movie</em>.</p> \n<p>It was a short film, a strange synthesis of documentary, re-enactment and impressionistic flights of fancy. But it was a breakthrough moment. Previously, there had been little or no open discussion of this shameful episode in Balkan history. Now here was a 10-year-old boy, led by Gegic, telling his strange, benighted and touching life story.</p> \n<p>The film made a big impact at the Sarajevo film festival, was shown in Moscow and won an&nbsp;award&nbsp;at the Sofia film festival. It also paved&nbsp;the way for <em>Grbavica</em>, a feature film by Jasmila Zbanic that came out a couple of years&nbsp;after Gegic’s short film and won the Golden Bear award at the Berlin film festival in 2006. Although <em>Grbavica</em> also deals with the fallout of&nbsp;the campaign of systematic rapes by Serb forces, it focuses on a single mother in Sarajevo and therefore deals with the subject from a more&nbsp;overtly female perspective. Nonetheless Gegic has a point when he says he initiated the artistic debate about this particular aspect of the&nbsp;war.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQiMvSdLk_4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQiMvSdLk_4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Jasmila Zbanic’s Grbavica won a Golden Bear award at the Berlin film festival.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But if <em>A Boy From a War Movie</em> shed light on a neglected corner of the Balkans’ recent past, it also raised more questions than it answered. Who were Muhic’s biological parents? Unbeknown to the audience, the mother did appear briefly in the film as an unnamed and disguised victim of rape. But there was no mention of her biological relationship with Muhic.</p> \n<p>What became of her and the rapist father? And what was going to happen to the young boy with the heavy weight of his criminal creation to bear through his tender years.</p> \n<p>A decade later, Gegic returned to the story and the result is a full-length film that once again mixes elements of documentary, drama and what Gegic calls his “artistic vision”.</p> \n<p>I meet the director at a screening room in a cinema in central Sarajevo. It’s a small, beautiful city, surrounded by dramatic hills on which once stood lethal Serb artillery positions. For almost four years during the 1990s, the town was effectively cut off and subject to relentless attacks. It is said to be the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Sarajevo\" title=\"\">longest siege of a capital city</a> in modern warfare. Almost 14,000 people were killed and more than 5,000 of those were civilians. Although there has been a great deal of rebuilding and regeneration, there are still many battle-scarred buildings that testify to the brutal conditions the inhabitants of Sarajevo&nbsp;endured.</p> \n<p>Just across from the cinema is a memorial to children killed in the siege. Almost every aspect of Sarajevo’s rich and troubled history is cheek by jowl. It’s what lends the place its distinctive atmosphere of close-knit cosmopolitanism. Famously multi-ethnic, it has long paid host to three main communities: Muslim, Orthodox Serb and Catholic Croat.</p> \n<p>Sarajevans are proud of the manner in which an Ottoman mosque will sit next to a neo-classical church and how, up until the war, nobody much cared or noticed which faith, if any, their neighbours followed. The other aspect of Sarajevo’s compact size and eventful history is that you can walk in a few minutes from the spot at the Latin bridge where Archduke Ferdinand was assassinated, thus sparking the first world war, to the Markale marketplace, whose<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markale_massacres\" title=\"\"> lethal bombing</a> by the army of the Republika Srpska led to Nato’s intervention in 1995 and the eventual cessation of the war.</p> \n<p>Gegic is a sprightly, bearded character in his mid-60s who, by way of introduction, lists his achievements as if he were proffering an extended CV. He tells me how representatives of Vanessa Redgrave and, separately, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro sought rights to screen <em>A Boy From a War Movie</em>. He runs through his various awards and informs me that the applause “lasted for 13 and a half minutes” after its screening at the Sofia film festival. It’s fair to say that the director is not the kind of man who keeps an eye out for a bushel under which to hide his light.</p> \n<p>After he made the film, he withdrew it from circulation in Bosnia because some critics suggested that he had exploited the young Muhic’s need and vulnerability. “For several years after that I did not feel safe about my own life or that of my family in this country,” claims Gegic.</p> \n<p>From whom did he feel under threat?</p> \n<p>“Everyone and everything,” he says, perhaps a little melodramatically. “Because I did really put the lives of my family in danger by helping Alen come forward with his identity and his story. There were discussions in the media about alleged abuse by me of this child for whatever purposes. There were telephone threats. People would stop me and call me names in the street.”</p> \n<p>He says that his reputation was saved by the work of American researchers, specifically Charli Carpenter, who showed that “I was the one who helped Alen Muhic to step forward and say, ‘I am not an invisible child any longer. I am visible now.’”</p> \n<p>Becirbasic agrees. “It seems to me this long-lasting collaboration with Gegic has helped Muhic reconstruct his tragic and complex background or, to quote his own words, ‘liberate his identity’. He should know.”</p> \n<p>Muhic became something of a local celebrity. Interviewed repeatedly on TV and courted by&nbsp;politicians, he was turned into the poster&nbsp;boy&nbsp;for a sort of Bosnian stoicism in the face of relentless provocation. In a country that felt itself to have suffered a form of national rape, Muhic symbolised an indomitable spirit of&nbsp;survival.</p> \n<p>In any case, after finishing the original film, Gegic says, he told Alen to stay in touch and that if he ever needed anything to get in contact.</p> \n<p>“He called me a year and a half ago. He said, ‘I have a suspicion that you are the only person who knows both my biological mother and my biological father. And I want you to help me find&nbsp;them.’”</p> \n<p>Gegic says he didn’t give Muhic, now a strapping young man, a straight answer, although he agreed to help him if they could make another film together.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_Js2zzAluM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i_Js2zzAluM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Interview with Alen Muhic\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I didn’t tell him the truth that after this first short film was screened, his mother called me from the United States and she kept calling. One night, she would call me and ask me to film her as well, and the next day she would call and threaten that she would kill me, poison me.”</p> \n<p>Another consequence of the first film was that Muhic’s biological father was finally forced to undergo a DNA test and when it was proved that he was indeed the father, he was tried and convicted of repeated and violently aggravated rape. He was sentenced to five and a half years in&nbsp;prison.</p> \n<p>But after 18 months, two protected witnesses from Foca, where the crime had taken place, came forward to claim that the biological father and mother were in a relationship before the war.</p> \n<p>“That really has nothing to do with the rape he was sentenced for,” Gegic rightly points out. The father also suggested that he wanted to get to know his son. Taking this information into account, the judge reduced the rapist’s sentence to 18 months and he was immediately released.</p> \n<p>The situation, then, was complex, contested and fraught with difficulties. In other words, the ideal scenario for a searching documentary. But that’s not exactly what Gegic made. I watched the film, called <em>An Invisible Child’s Trap</em>, with him in the screening room. There were no subtitles so a translator gave simultaneous English translation in my ear.</p> \n<p>The first thing to notice is that there are two people “playing” Alen: Muhic himself and an actor who performs as a sidekick and alter ego. Why two Alens?</p> \n<p>“Alen is a child with two identities,” Gegic tells me after the screening. “All children like Alen have two identities. He was truly afraid of the emotions he might express if he met his biological parents, especially his father. And being a director I was also afraid of that. So this is why I introduced this second Alen as a sort of defensive&nbsp;mechanism.”</p> \n<p>This was not documentary film-making in the Anglo-American tradition. At times, the “acting” seemed amateurish and at others the real-life scenes appeared a little too professionally arranged. But perhaps the most surprising detail in a film about Muhic’s search for his biological parents is that neither of them appears at any time, with the exception of a brief piece of news footage from the father’s trial.</p> \n<p>The advance word on the film, as put about by Gegic, strongly suggested a resolution, revelatory or cathartic, and there was more than a hint in our arrangements that I would be able to speak to the biological mother. Yet she was more absent from the second feature-length film than she had been from the original short film.</p> \n<p>However, Gegic told me, Alen did meet his biological father, so why wasn’t this scene included in the film?</p> \n<p>“My initial intention was to close this film with the meeting between him and his father,” says Gegic. “But as far as his father goes, he’s going to be part of the third film. This is meant to be a trilogy. I’m working on the third part. It already has a name: <em>The Shadow of White Donkeys</em>.”</p> \n<p>Perhaps sensing how perplexed I was that a documentary about a son’s search for his rapist father omits the moment when they meet, not to mention the bemusing relevance or otherwise of white donkeys, Gegic added: “If I made it a part of this film, which I could still do, then it would create a problem, because Muhic wants to seek a retrial of his father.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee795fcf43201124e11c7539cb6491662b7fed8a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436371250591/74034ccd-268e-47f1-a8c2-4ddd10d28402-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Alen Muhic, photographed in Sarajevo in June.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alen Muhic, photographed in Sarajevo in June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edin Tuzlak/The Observer New Review</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The following day, I met Muhic, who travelled in from Gorazde, where he works as an orderly in the hospital in which he was born. He is a quietly spoken, rather shy young man of 22, with a body-builder’s frame and a busy cigarette habit.</p> \n<p>We sat with Gegic in a cafe above the cinema. In the same way that it’s impossible to distinguish Catholics from Protestants in Belfast&nbsp;purely from their appearance, it’s mostly the same in Sarajevo as regards the Muslim, Catholic and Orthodox communities. There are no ethnic differences to speak of. Although some Muslims have taken to wearing beards and&nbsp;headscarves since the war, the large majority&nbsp;still look and behave (drinking alcohol, eating pork) no differently to Serb and Croat Sarajevans.</p> \n<p>All that really testifies to religious background are names. When Muhic was a boy, he was nicknamed Pero – a common Serb name – by others in his neighbourhood in Gorazde. He didn’t like the questionable provenance that the name suggested. Was he concerned about his identity now?</p> \n<p>“I declare myself as a Bosniak and a Muslim because this is the environment I grew up in and this is what my family declares themselves as,” he replies between drags on his cigarette. “But, you know, I don’t really have this strong religious or national identity. If I was born in any other group, I would just declare myself as part of that. I have nothing against any religion. In essence, they are all the same.”</p> \n<p>It’s a noble response, although a familiar enough one in many parts of Bosnia, even today. But Muhic’s whole life, from his very conception, has been shaped and determined by these ancient group identities and recently cultivated animosities. They were almost certainly a key part of the motivation and self-justification that led his father to rape his mother.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a59e6bb36cc372a63d3072712d35b8ebf882ea1b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436372340146/3d0f0f9a-ec11-4970-9ef6-45307d4e1e8f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alen Muhic with film director Semsudin Gegic at a screening of An Invisible Child's Trap.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alen Muhic with film director Semsudin Gegic at a screening of An Invisible Child’s Trap.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edin Tuzlak/The Observer New Review</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That can’t have been easy knowledge for Muhic to absorb and it must have grown much more difficult when he finally encountered his biological father. In the film, we see that, through an intermediary, Muhic’s father makes it clear that he doesn’t want to meet his son. In response, Muhic says, he decided to abandon his&nbsp;search.</p> \n<p>Then one day a Muslim cleric from a neighbouring village to Muhic’s biological father called the young man and tipped him off about his father’s presence.</p> \n<p>“So I thought about it quickly,” says Muhic, “and then I told my friend, ‘Since he’s here, let’s try to meet him.’”</p> \n<p>He was very nervous as he approached the house in which his biological father lived, uncertain of what sort of welcome lay in store. The now middle-aged man came to the door and told Muhic that he knew who he was because he’d been following his story and also looking at his Facebook page.</p> \n<p>“So we started talking,” says Muhic, stubbing out one cigarette and then lighting another, “and then we came to the topic of whether he was my father or not.”</p> \n<p>The palpable tension as Muhic describes the conversation only confirms that it would have made a dramatic climax to the film, had it been filmed and included.</p> \n<p>“First of all, he spoke only about the war, then as we moved to the topic of my paternity, his voice became agitated and he said that he was not my father, that he had never committed any war crimes and that he had been framed, set up.”</p> \n<p>They spoke for about an hour. Muhic says that the family living next door to his biological father had told him that he reminded them of the older man so much that it was like talking to him when he was a young man. “And I realised when I was talking to him that it was as if I was looking at myself 20 years from now.”</p> \n<p>Yet at the same time he experienced no personal affinity or filial feelings of any kind for the older lookalike in front of him. By the end of their conversation, in which his biological father flagrantly denied being his father, in spite of their resemblance, the DNA evidence and the court verdict, Muhic concluded that he never wanted to see this man again.</p> \n<p>“He is trying to make himself a victim, as if bad things were done to him, when he actually committed crimes. He is my biological father on paper, but that’s all he is. I would not even call him a person. For what he’s done I would call him a monster.”</p> \n<p>As for his mother, he says his feelings towards her are the very opposite of those he harbours for his father. “I would like to meet her and I don’t blame her for anything. I don’t even blame her for leaving me or not getting in contact with me for the last 20-odd years, because of what happened to her.”</p> \n<p>He now has her phone number and, he says, he’s tried calling several times, but either she didn’t answer or the connection was too bad to speak. “One time her husband answered but I didn’t feel like talking to him. One of the main reasons that I would like to meet her is that I learned that she has two sons in this marriage and I would like to meet my brothers or half‑brothers.”</p> \n<p>Gegic says she had twice said she was coming to Bosnia, only to pull out each time. But the plan was that she would come this month. Again it’s Gegic’s intention to put this reunion in a third&nbsp;film.</p> \n<p>Muhic’s extraordinary story is one that represents a whole range of dark conflicts – not just those that ravaged the Balkans, but also those that exist between truth and falsehood, between rapacious males and their female victims, and our own internal conflicts that forge our complex identities. Yet for all its emotive richness, it’s not a story that requires a third film.</p> \n<p>Instead, Gegic should take all the footage he’s assembled over many years and fashion one single and compelling document about Alen Muhic. It could show how an abandoned baby boy in a war-torn corner of Europe went in search of the real story about his parents and found out a vital truth about not just himself but also the human condition. Where we come from will always matter, but in the end, after all the pain and humiliation and setbacks, not nearly as much as where we’re going.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436371374904/Alen-Muhic-was-the-subjec-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alen Muhic was the subject of a film made when he was 10 years old.

He had to pretend to approve when a national living wage, one of his pet causes, was appropriated by his competitor for the Tory crown, as the chancellor sought to divert attention from the scythe he was taking to in-work benefits. Overall, the backbencher for Uxbridge and the rest of the Tory party were given a masterclass in what a powerful chancellor can do to disorient his external opponents, eclipse his internal enemies, set the political weather and promote himself.</p> \n<p>Interestingly, the green-eyed monster can also be glimpsed at Number 10. Friends of the prime minister sound a little put out that so many plaudits have been showered on the next-door neighbour. They want to establish some ownership of the budget for the prime minister. One of his allies is keen for it to be known that “they built it together from the ground up”. David Cameron may also be getting irritated when he hears people say – and this is often said by ministers – that the next-door neighbour is the most powerful man in government.</p> \n<p>The budget demonstrated the enormous clout of a long-serving chancellor when he wields the imperial dominance of the Treasury over the rest of Whitehall. From education to the environment, defence to welfare, he roamed across the waterfront of government. A telling example is the shotgun way in which the BBC was forced to take on the cost of free TV licences. The new culture secretary, John Whittingdale, was bounced as well. He was given little notice of the decision and no chance to demur. Says a person highly familiar with events: “George told John it was going to happen. End of story.”</p> \n<p>I used to think that Mr Osborne’s ambitions were capped at being a powerful chancellor, not least because he previously gave the impression that he thought Number 10 was beyond his reach. His friends would often say that he recognised that it was his role to be the Treasury technician to David Cameron’s showman. That has clearly changed. He can now see a path for himself to Number 10. And I think we can put a date on the moment when the ambition crystallised. It was 8 May. On the day before, he was not confident that his party would win a parliamentary majority – he sent a stream of texts to Nick Clegg urging him to do another coalition deal with the Tories. If the Conservatives had lost the election, George Osborne would have been toast. Had they failed to secure a parliamentary majority for a second time in a row, that would have been a failure with which he would have been indelibly associated. When they looked for their next leader, the Tories would have sought a change candidate. It was the winning of a majority that has burnished him as the joint architect of a successful project and made it more probable that the Tories will choose the continuity candidate to follow David Cameron.</p> \n<p>The overarching aim of that project is to emulate the electoral achievements of Thatcherism and Blairism. In their different ways, those election hat-trick winners dominated politics by redefining what it means to be on the centre ground and then commanding that territory. To that end, the budget was laced with challenges to the Labour party when the opposition is at its most vulnerable. The design is to force Labour to choose between conceding ground to the Tories or becoming trapped in leftwing positions from which it can’t be elected.</p> \n<p>Squeezing the size of the state is integral to this project, but the chancellor has always been a bit more pragmatic about how rapidly he gets there than either he or his opponents have liked to acknowledge. He also knows that the Tories’ election victory was not impressive and they won not because they were loved, but because Labour was feared. So part of his purpose was to suggest that there is more to him than just the flinty fiscal hawk who relishes axing things.</p> \n<p>I predicted a fortnight ago that he would soften the profile of the spending cuts over this parliament – and he duly did. He has put back his estimate of when he will finally clear the deficit by a year. That still entails a serious squeeze, but the process will be slower and take longer. Ironically, the future path of spending now looks much more like the one recommended to the electorate by the poor old Lib Dems. Which, you will recall, he ridiculed as reckless during the election campaign. A smoother path to deficit reduction should also mean less bloody battles with cabinet colleagues whose support he will want in the succession.</p> \n<p>He has also put more of the burden of deficit reduction on taxation, an unacknowledged concession to critics who have long said he placed too much emphasis on cuts. The net tax take will go up by more than &pound;6bn a year by 2020, something that Mr Osborne forgot to mention during the election campaign or in his budget speech. Funny that. The taxes he cut were the headline ones that everyone understands. The taxes he put up were generally more obscure. That’s an old trick straight out of the Gordon Brown playbook. The rises included a new levy on bank profits and higher taxes on people who receive a lot of dividend income – two ideas that he vetoed in the last parliament when they were proposed by his then Lib Dem deputy, Danny Alexander.</p> \n<p>Ruthless poaching of useful or popular ideas from opponents was one of the hallmarks of this budget. In fact, I have never seen it done so shamelessly. When Ed Miliband proposed a modest spot of state intervention to freeze energy prices and cap rents, the Tories denounced him as a crazed Marxist. Now the chancellor plans a charge on employers to fund more apprenticeships and to sequester the private assets of housing associations. When the Labour leader proposed to increase the minimum wage to &pound;8 an hour, the Tories trashed him as Red Ed.</p> \n<p>Now the chancellor says he’ll raise Labour’s election promise and make it &pound;9 an hour by 2020. This is a higher and re-badged minimum wage. It is not a “living wage” in the sense that the groups that have campaigned for one recognise. Nor does it compensate for the slashing of tax credits. The chancellor’s rhetoric about the Tories becoming “the party of working people” will sound very hollow to the 13 million people left the poorer. We do not have to swallow all his spin to see that it was nevertheless a very artful piece of politics.</p> \n<p>Labour is quarrelling with itself about how to respond to the budget. His own party is delirious. Most of the media is beguiled. As of this weekend, it has never looked likelier that George Osborne will be the next prime minister.</p> \n<p>Likelier, but not certain. Between him and the prize, there are several serious hurdles. One is Europe. His chances of becoming prime minister and then leading the Tories to another victory in 2020 are heavily contingent on David Cameron managing to get the Tory party through the referendum without doing irreparable damage to itself. Then there is the tension between the strategic electoral goal of repositioning the Tories as a “one nation” party governing for the majority and the atavistic desire of Conservatives to look after their own whatever the cost in social justice. A true meritocrat would not have prioritised an inheritance tax windfall for the heirs of the propertied wealthy while removing support for bright students from poorer homes.</p> \n<p>Boris hasn’t gone away. The chancellor is never going to be competitive with the mayor of London when it comes to that mysterious electoral aphrodisiac called charisma. His answer will be to invite the Tory party to compare their curricula vitae. One has been a character mayor of the capital with limited powers. The other is, as he will tell the story to his party, the mastermind of a project to permanently restore the Tories as the dominant party of British politics.</p> \n<p>The greatest peril to George Osborne’s ambitions is time. His reputation ultimately turns on what happens to the economy, something that no chancellor, however omniscient he may pretend to be, can entirely predict. I know it may not feel that way to many people, but the current recovery is getting quite old in the tooth. World stock markets have been in a bull phase for an above-average duration. The IMF has recently been worrying that global growth is stuttering. The wild bungee jumping of the Chinese stock market and the crisis over Greece are reminders of the power of events to derail the best-laid plans.</p> \n<p>A chancellor can be clever at the politics – and this one is as sly as a den of foxes – but his fortunes will boom and bust with the economic cycle. To achieve his ultimate ambition, George Osborne needs to get his furniture moved across to Number 10 before the next downturn comes knocking.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436630156305/Summer-Budget-2015-osborn-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Boris Johnson puts a brave face on Osborne's ragging during the budget speech Photograph: PA Wire/Press Association Images","credit":"/PA Wire/Press Association Images","altText":"Summer Budget 2015 osborne","cleanCaption":"Boris Johnson puts a brave face on Osborne's ragging during the budget speech Photograph: PA Wire/Press Association Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-11T23:09:04Z","lastModified":"2015-07-11T23:09:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Andrew Rawnsley","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/5/29/1432894748217/Andrew-Rawnsley-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/andrewrawnsley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["George Osborne","Economics","Budget 2015 (July)","Boris Johnson","Politics"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/georgeosborne","webTitle":"George Osborne"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"uk-news/budget-2015-july","webTitle":"Budget 2015 (July)"},{"id":"politics/boris","webTitle":"Boris Johnson"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Andrew Rawnsley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/andrewrawnsley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/12/george-osborne-master-of-all-her-surveys","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atxa","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jul/12/george-osborne-master-of-all-her-surveys","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jul/12/george-osborne-master-of-all-her-surveys"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436630156305/Summer-Budget-2015-osborn-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Boris Johnson puts a brave face on Osborne’s ragging during the budget speech.

For her to suddenly now be with this guy who’s an MP at 23… it’s quite mad.”</p> \n<p>It <em>is</em> quite mad. Donaldson is one of the new SNP MPs, and in any ordinary political landscape he would have been an out-and-out no-hoper – he had a 17,000 majority to overturn, and the SNP didn’t even come second in his constituency last time. And yet here he is, in Portcullis House, the building across the road from Westminster that’s home to many MP offices, on one of the hottest days of the year, sweating away in a suit he’s clearly not used to wearing.</p> \n<p>His original plan was to go to China and work for a tour company. Instead he’s entered parliament, by what seems almost like accident. This has its swings and roundabouts. On the one hand, he’s landed perhaps the best graduate salary ever. That must be quite nice, I say. “It’s actually a bit overwhelming,” he says. “I’ve suddenly got all this money. I’m not sure what to do with it.” On the other, he’s struggling to adapt to a whole new climate. “It has never been as hot as this in Scotland, ever.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"40e61fb5fcd3041e5958b2678fe6cc85882c763c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436546447152/4ac062ab-608c-49d8-a2dd-1b747562191b-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Stuart Donaldson.

How could I not? He’s so unassuming and unpolitician-like, and keeps saying the kinds of things I imagine would cause most spin doctors to have a cardiac event. And as much as I’d like to patronise him – he’s only a couple of years older than my nephew, who I’m not sure I’d trust to run a bath let alone the country – it becomes clear when I speak to him that he won his seat through a combination of hard graft and a very clever and effective grassroots campaign. And, of course, the massive tidal wave of popularity for the SNP that took everyone by surprise, not least the SNP.</p> \n<p>Kirsten Oswald, the new member for East Renfrewshire, tells me they joke about the people who popped out for a pint of milk in January and came back as MPs, and it’s not far off what actually happened. She wasn’t even a member of the party a year ago. The incredible success of Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP turned out to be the story of the 2015 election, and the result is a massive new influx of 56 SNP MPs, up from just six in the last parliament, and lone, embattled representatives for each of the Scottish Labour, Conservative and the Lib Dem parties.</p> \n<p>All over Westminster I find natural redheads and strawberry blonds with pale, freckled skin reddening in the sun. “It’s an extremely difficult place to get to grips with,” Toby Helm, the <em>Observer</em>’s political editor tells me. “It’s like entering the weirdest boarding school ever. These days you see them hanging around in small groups and hear Scottish accents far more often about the place. They are clearly quite enjoying it. But it is an extraordinary thing they are trying to do. They want to appear like they are playing a constructive part in parliamentary life at Westminster while really what they are plotting is to torpedo the union and break free of Westminster altogether.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"41883bef5bd2c9958ab87e24c807a820a40ab4d4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436546577191/f07ab027-eefc-4aa6-9957-2e1116fe93f2-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tommy Sheppard.

And yet here they are now, part of it. What’s it like, I ask Tommy Sheppard, the new member for Edinburgh East, being in the belly of the beast? Isn’t this – and I wave my arm across a stupendous view of the palace of Westminster and the Thames – everything you stand against?</p> \n<p>“Well, yes. By any test of what a modern, democratic government is, this place is a shambles. It’s a cross between a museum and a pantomime.”</p> \n<p>Sheppard is another unlikely member of the SNP benches. He’s the owner of the Stand comedy club in Edinburgh and was previously a hardcore Labour activist. And, like a huge swath of Scotland, his conversion to the nationalist cause only happened about three minutes ago. “If you’d said to me a year ago I would be an SNP MP, I’d have denied both parts of that statement.”</p> \n<p>I know the SNP needs to play this up for the Scottish crowd back home, but he has a point about the place. I’m not a political reporter. I’ve never worked in the lobby. I’m just Ms Average who has spent two days hanging around the Palace of Westminster, and I can safely report that it is a ridiculous place. There’s no getting away from it. Given the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/18/palace-of-westminster-renovation-options-report\">&pound;7bn estimate to renovate it</a>, I’m now converted to the idea that it should be turned into a luxury hotel, and a new building modelled on a Travelodge should be built in somewhere like Bolton. The doormen wear black tie and tails, and whichever way you look there’s somebody in a gold brooch and chain for no discernible reason. And then there’s prime minister’s questions, which makes most lay people want to give up their passport and leave the country.</p> \n<p>“That’s the worst,” Philippa Whitford tells me. “I sit there thinking, ‘What am I doing here?’”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b8c07073ffc4eda24170869bab09d1882853846\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436547133580/20e1e96f-2aeb-447b-a593-7235966b3cd3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Philippa Whitford Then: Consultant breast surgeon.

That’s why it’s so awful, PMQs. I sit there and think: ‘I used to do a useful job.’”</p> \n<p>One thing the new SNP MPs have done has been to shine a light on some of the more arcane practices at Westminster. Joanna Cherry, the new MP for Edinburgh South West, who’s another impressive woman at the top of her game – she’s a QC – said: “Some people have said they’ve found more about what goes on in the House of Commons as a result of the SNP tweets than they’d ever known before.”</p> \n<p>It raises the question of why other parties haven’t challenged some of the more antiquated procedures. One of the most powerful and political acts the SNP has undertaken so far has been to simply show up. So many MPs simply don’t bother. “That’s one thing I have been impressed by,” John Crace, the <em>Guardian</em>’s parliamentary sketch writer tells me. “Their attendance levels. They turn up. They are definitely here to make an impact and to be noticed.”</p> \n<p>They have been: there was a whole flurry of stories when they arrived and started “<em>Defying</em> convention!” as the <em>Daily Mail</em> put it. “The Scots have arrived!” ran the headline. “SNP MPs break the rules in their first week by taking selfies in the Commons as they celebrate election takeover with chips on the terrace.” It was illustrated with a photo of Mhairi Black, the new member for Paisley and Renfrewshire South, eating her lunch – chips and a slice – a photo taken by a fellow MP and tweeted with the caption: “Ye can take the lassie out of…”</p> \n<p>Torcuil Crichton, political editor of the <em>Daily Record </em>in Glasgow, says that there was a certain amount of trepidation before they turned up: “The Conservatives had very successfully managed to demonise them. They had played a dangerous game, inflaming a fear of Scotland, causing both Lib Dem and Labour voters to turn to the Tories. And when they appeared in Westminster, I mean it was as if Westminster was waiting for aliens to arrive.”</p> \n<p>Everything they did became a story. “The Scots are invading… the Labour benches!” ran the <em>Mail</em>’s next headline. “New SNP MPs defy convention to sit directly behind the opposition front row.” Among them, it stated “was the SNP’s 20-year-old Mhairi Black… asked about her choice of seat, she said: ‘I didn’t see any signs.’”</p> \n<p>“She literally just walked in, chatting with Diane Abbott and sat down next to her – she didn’t know,” one SNP MP recalls. “It was like the story about us trying to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/shortcuts/2015/may/19/snp-first-big-westminster-battle-dennis-skinner-seat\">steal Dennis Skinner’s seat</a> – even he’s said that was complete rubbish.”</p> \n<p>And then there was “clapgate”, when – instead of saying “hear hear” at something they agreed with, as if they were 18th-century landowners – they broke into that newfangled concept: applause. Or as the <em>Mail</em> put it: “Show some respect! Furious Speaker Bercow rebukes new Scots Nats MPs for breaking strict Commons protocol by clapping during the Queen’s Speech debate.”</p> \n<p>They’ve stopped doing it now, sadly. “I think it was a real missed opportunity,” says Crichton. “In the Scottish parliament there’s applause all the time – it’s like an Italian opera. But the speaker censured them when they first did it, and then there was a pause. In that moment they should have carried on and overturned a centuries-old convention like that, but instead they swallowed it. And that was that. Now they shout ‘hear hear’ like everyone else.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fff28a46372fc1802a43a0e552bdc36ba13cf5bd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436547309709/2ecd78d0-f7f8-43df-ac32-081070cc7fd7-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Mhairi Black Then: Politics student.

While it seems gobsmacking to me that Stuart Donaldson is an MP at 23, Black was just 20 when she unseated one of Labour’s big beasts, Douglas Alexander, in what was one of the most <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/video/2015/may/08/snp-student-mhairi-black-defeats-labour-incumbent-douglas-alexander\">astonishing upsets of the election</a>. And she’s been the centre of much of the press – good and bad – since then. “It’s been mental, completely mental,” she says when I meet her in the central lobby, an ornate high gothic affair. “There’s just been so much… <em>nonsense</em>.”</p> \n<p>We’ve barely reached the outside Terrace cafe overlooking the Thames and sat down when a woman with a bunch of teenagers comes up and asks if she can introduce her son and his friends. “Do you mind? I’ve just told them how you’re an MP and they couldn’t believe how young you are.” She poses for selfies with them, the teenagers looking rather overwhelmingly impressed. But then, I’m more than twice their age and I’m rather overwhelmingly impressed.</p> \n<p>She’s the youngest MP since 1832, and she ran her campaign while studying for her finals – a politics degree at Glasgow university – and revised for her last exam in the House of Commons library. What was it on? “Scottish politics. Which was pretty funny. There was a question on the SNP though, so that was quite good.”</p> \n<p>Last week, she found out she’d got a first. It’s impressive by anyone’s standards, though having met her, I’m not surprised. When I ask which she’s proudest of, getting a first or being elected to parliament, she says: “It’s humbling to have been chosen to represent people. There’s no bigger honour than that. But for me, personally, I’m most proud of getting my degree. I didn’t expect to get it at all. I just worked really, really hard.”</p> \n<p>It’s a textbook answer, which from anyone else might sound phoney, but when she says it in her broad west coast accent – she sounds like a Glaswegian docker, basically – she does it with an authenticity that I actually believe. She’s not just impressive because she’s 20. She’s impressive because she carries conviction. When she talks about the poverty and deprivation in her constituency and the biting effects of austerity, she says it with authority.</p> \n<p>“What I can’t work out about this place,” she says, “is whether they’re genuinely oblivious to what their policies are doing, whether they’re so out of touch that they honestly don’t see how much damage it’s doing, or whether they just don’t care.”</p> \n<p>It was Black’s victory that brought home what a total bloodbath Scotland was for Labour. Douglas Alexander wasn’t just the shadow foreign secretary, he was the mastermind of Miliband’s campaign. What a shock it must have been for him, I say. “I imagine so, aye. He had his eyes set on being foreign secretary, trips to Washington and all that. And then along comes me. There was panic at the end. It was almost as if the national campaign was abandoned. I’ve lived in Paisley all my life, and I saw more of Douglas Alexander in the last month than I have in the last 10 years.”</p> \n<p>Nobody expected her to win. And she’d never dreamed of standing until people kept telling her she ought to. “I took the same approach as everybody else, going, ‘Oh, come on. I’m 20. Don’t be daft.’ What convinced me in the end was that somebody said: ‘Who came up with the idea that parliament had to be middle-aged, middle-class guys anyway?’ That’s actually what the problem is. Parliament has to reflect everybody, because the more diverse opinions you get, the better quality the policy is.”</p> \n<p>Exactly. Though being that person has its responsibilities. “I will still go to the pub and have a drink with my friends,” she says, explaining what her life is like now. “But you know. You can’t get moroculous.”</p> \n<p>Moroculous?</p> \n<p>“You know like being sick against a wall or something.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"87c073091b5826ebf692284e39e442a1d8a28325\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436547645712/53c8e7ad-686f-474a-b5b9-fa498778b07c-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Chris Law Then: Leader of motorcycle expeditions to the Himalayas.

The reasons are well rehearsed – tax breaks for the old because they’re the ones who vote whereas the young don’t – but then, of all the things that the Scottish referendum did, energising young people to take an interest in politics is perhaps one of the most significant.</p> \n<p>“They were just so engaged,” says Stuart Donaldson. “During the referendum there was this massive event in the Glasgow Hydro and it was full of schoolkids asking questions to people from both sides of the campaign. To see that was really amazing.”</p> \n<p>There are other things that perhaps the rest of British politics could learn from the Scottish example. Not least the fact that what’s most striking about the SNP MPs I meet is how normal they seem. Only one talks to me as if she thinks she’s on <em>Newsnight</em>. The rest are disarmingly like actual people. “It was striking when they first arrived,” Torcuil Crichton tells me. “They were posing on the steps of St Stephen’s for photos, and I just listened to them chatting and thought, ‘Wow.’ It really is a cross-section of people and accents. Some of them have only been members of the SNP for six months and some of them are lifelong nationalists but they’re from all corners of Scotland and they’re all interesting, fully rounded people.”</p> \n<p>With some unlikely stories. There’s Deidre Brock, who was born and grew up in Australia and in her previous life, as an actor in Sydney, appeared in <em>Home and Away</em>. There’s Chris Law, who someone recommends I talk to on the grounds that “he has an interesting background and he doesn’t look like an MP”, which turns out to mean that he has a ponytail and worked for a long time in north-west India, leading motorcycle tours of the Himalayas on vintage Enfields. There’s John Nicolson, who’s a familiar face from the television as a BBC journalist. And Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh, who has become the SNP’s first Muslim MP and has a past that includes being a member of the Conservative party and a Bollywood actor.</p> \n<p>A noticeable number of those I interview are gay – Joanna Cherry, Mhairi Black, John Nicolson. The SNP not only has a higher percentage of gay MPs than any other parliamentary party in Europe, but, according to John Nicolson, “because of our presence, it’s the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/13/quiet-revolution-britain-more-gay-mps-than-anywhere-else-lgbt\">most gay parliament in the world</a>”. And it’s striking when they tell me about their commutes, by planes, trains and automobiles – Ian Blackford, an ex-banker from Skye, explains how he leaves “at 6pm on Thursday and I get home between 2-5am on Friday morning” – because they do actually live in their constituencies.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2dfdaac3dcebde232f7b8963eaa0658214601c7f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436547867254/f74eedf6-df81-4987-9d8d-d4ded56e654e-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"John Nicolson Then: BBC TV journalist.

And the bloodless career politicians who have bounced from PPE at Oxford to a thinktank to the front bench or shadow front bench are nowhere to be seen in the SNP. Not least because no one in their right mind thought there was any career in Westminster politics for an SNP MP.</p> \n<p>The difference between their energy, optimism and conviction and what I saw at the Labour party conference in Manchester last autumn is striking. I went there to do a story for the <em>Observer New Review</em> and wrote about how it had all the passion and authenticity of a L’Or&eacute;al sales conference, with various PPE graduates from Oxbridge arguing about the product lines. And I always like to tell the story of the MP I knew – a PPE-er from Oxford – who went on to become a minister after bagging a safe seat in a northern constituency he had no connection to whatsoever. He was invited around to Sunday dinner by one of the leading lights in the constituency. “So I turned up at 8pm with a bottle of wine, and he was like, ‘Nay lad, I said dinner. We had it hours ago.’” In fairness, he told that story against himself, but, well, it’s not really one of the great, inspirational tales of the Labour movement that they’ll be telling 100 years from now.</p> \n<p>But, then, it’s a question at the moment if there even <em>will</em> be a Labour movement 100 years from now. “Labour just look so crushed,” says John Crace. “It’s hard to find a Labour MP with a smile on his or her face. The SNP are looking and sounding more like a proper opposition because Labour is in a total mess.”</p> \n<p>When Chris Grayling announced his surprise <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jul/09/english-votes-english-laws-plan-revised-conservatives-dup\">English votes for English laws (Evel) bill</a> last week, most of the Labour front bench were nowhere to be seen – there was a leadership hustings event going on at the same time. (The SNP MPs are predictably outraged at the proposals but there are a few questions to answer: it’s only after chatting to Philippa Whitford, the breast surgeon, at length about her role as the party’s health spokesman that she points out that health is actually a devolved issue.)</p> \n<p>Looking like a credible and organised opposition is “their game”, another political editor points out: “It’s theatre. They’re putting on this performance but their interest, really, is in screwing the system.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cefdf77c602d7b579b8a2946ecc6afcbfa987370\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436548796757/e8573cd9-53d0-418f-b412-d84c12357287-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Roger Mullin Then: Teaching applied decision theory at the University of Stirling.

They have a really clear vision, a dynamic, good, young female leader, and they just pulled off a phenomenal thing.”</p> \n<p>It’s a jovial MP called Roger Mullin who really conveys the depth and despair of the Labour mission in Scotland. I’ve just interviewed Deidre Brock, and she sends him over to find me on the terrace. He sits down with a pint in his hand. He’s an SNP lifer who, at the age of 67, really didn’t see this coming. In his maiden speech he pointed out that he’d first stood for parliament in 1974. “I said, ‘It’s been a rather long campaign.’” And then tells me how he’s “the new Gordon Brown”.</p> \n<p>He’s the new MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath where, in 2010, Gordon Brown won a 23,000 majority. In 2015 Mullin converted that into a 10,000 majority for the SNP. “I was the first person to break the television swingometer,” he says. He’s entirely gleeful when he tells this story, as he deserves to be, but it brings it home to me because, whatever else Gordon Brown was, he was a true believer: in Labour, in Scotland. His intervention in the referendum is credited with helping to save the union, but the sight of the party standing side by side with the Conservatives was too much for most Labour voters to swallow.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t entirely Labour’s fault,” says Crichton. “What happened in Scotland is not unique. There’s a massive wave of anti-politics that’s sweeping the world. It’s a global phenomenon, as is a surge in nationalism. Labour had a bad leader and took the Labour vote in Scotland for granted. But it fought for the union and it paid a high price.” The road to Downing Street, he points out, now “runs through Glasgow”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c910640140f97e2105b2f0231280c2b286f4d2c0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436547498388/ab0e15a8-4e3c-4bb6-a7fd-79931c9889c9-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh Then: Tory and actor.

It’s why the Tories are being so nice to them, says Crichton. “They’ve got a hug-a-nationalist policy because they know the SNP divides the left.”</p> \n<p>I’m not entirely sure either how the SNP has managed to convince Labour voters that it’s a party of the left, when many of its MPs aren’t. I try to get Tasmina Ahmed-Sheikh to tell me her road to Damascus moment when she realised she wasn’t a Conservative any longer, and all I’ll say is that she might want to work on that answer. And its track record in the Scottish parliament isn’t exactly impressive, says Crichton. “They’ve only introduced one policy since 2007 that has redistributed wealth.”</p> \n<p>Late at night in the terrace bar, I meet a very drunken Scot, a guest of an SNP MP, who nonetheless describes them as the “barmy army”. He points across the table at Michelle Thomson, the new member for Edinburgh West. “This one’s a right firebrand. As well as a property developer, of course. She’s like the rest of the party – a complete mess of irreconcilable contradictions.”</p> \n<p>“I’m sorry,” says Thomson. “But I don’t even know who you are?”</p> \n<p>At the moment the SNP MPs present a united front but that can’t last for ever, and nor can their current levels of popularity. I do start to understand, though, how MPs get <em>so</em> comfortable here. The terrace bar, with Big Ben bonging into the night, has the best view in London: to the left, the soaring faux-gothic buttresses of the Palace of Westminster, to the right the London Eye, straight ahead a scene of double-decker buses crossing Westminster bridge. It’s like the opening scene of a Hollywood film set in London. And all around, arresting sights such as Michael Gove drinking subsidised white wine and large groups of men (Tories? Maybe not…) getting in the champagne.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4cd3c23b16d43640f6b5851a059d88fe6d49d7da\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436547986417/ad9ad472-742a-43ee-827d-65aa838f706e-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Kirsten Oswald Then: HR professional.

There’s a ton of bars and restaurants where MPs hang out at all times of the working day – the sun isn’t even past the yardarm when I see Gove hitting the Sancerre. The SNP MPs have colonised the Sports and Social Club, which is where a lot of the parliamentary staff go, and which has a karaoke night. And there are always colleagues around to gossip with. People keep having conversations about “the Tories’ evil plan”, which I only belatedly realise is actually their <em>Evel</em> plan.</p> \n<p>It’s only been a couple of months, but John Crace tells me he already thinks they’ve become institutionalised. “They’re much more observant of parliamentary procedure. They’ve stopped taking photos of themselves. The <em>Mail</em> and <em>Telegraph</em> were portraying them as ignorant and unworthy so perhaps they’re trying to show they are serious. But this place does get to you. It feeds on your self-importance. You suddenly have a budget for staff, and you’re flying home on a Thursday night. I’m sure it must be happening to them because it happens to everyone. I’ve been here a year, and it’s probably happening to me. That’s the nature of power in Westminster.”</p> \n<p>It’s not in the SNP’s interests to get comfortable here. But it’s certainly an insight into what seduces so many politicians. Why they start talking like politicians. Why they don’t ever want to leave. It’s on the same terrace that John Nicolson, the ex-BBC journalist, gives me a list of phrases he’s sworn to never utter. “I’m never, ever going to say, ‘frankly’,” he says. Can you not talk about <em>hardworkingfamilies</em>, please, I say.</p> \n<p>“I’m never going to talk about hard-working families. And I will not say ‘fit for purpose’.”</p> \n<p>We’ll see. Ed Vaizey pops over while I’m talking to Nicolson to congratulate him on a question he asked in the BBC debate, and it all feels a bit cosy. As Tommy Sheppard points out to me: “It operates like an exclusive club.” Given that Sheppard actually ran a club, it’s possible he knows what he’s talking about. “All those doormen who greet you by name. And why are we called ‘members’ anyway?”</p> \n<p>It’s been a brilliant rebranding exercise, the new-look SNP. They repackaged nationalism as social justice, and delivered a message of optimism and hope that the electorate bought. And they’re there, in the House of Commons, turning up, being smart and sensible… and ultimately conspiring to leave the rest of us stranded, for all eternity, shrugging in listless apathy at what passes in this country for political debate.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436462904689/Scottish-first-minister-N-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Scottish first minister Nicola Sturgeon and the new SNP MPs pose in front of the Forth rail bridge on 9 May this year.

We were close when I was a child (I’m 23 now) and I drifted away from him during adolescence. I cannot put my finger on why, except perhaps I became more girly and less relatable to him. I am an only child and am very close to my mum. I am often a disappointment to him, but I cannot see my mistakes coming. I’m envious when my friends’ dads say they look lovely or when I see how tenderly the fathers of the children I babysit treat their wives and kids. Dad refers to my mum as bonkers, hopeless, waste of bloody space, mad bat, bloody useless, or just “ya mum” (“Where’s ya mum gone now?!”) or often just “woman”…</em></p> \n<p><strong>Mariella replies </strong>He’s a charmer! As you’ve made clear, your dad doesn’t wear his heart on his sleeve. How sad that the two of you are both trapped in patterns of behaviour that lock each other out. It’s guesswork my end, but it ’s no understatement to say that your father struggles with his emotional side. He’s not alone among his sex in finding it an embarrassment to let down his guard, particularly with the two women in his life. If he treated you more tenderly he’d be showing you he cares about you, and what a Pandora’s box that would open, eh?!</p> \n<p>Your father is a perfect stereotype of unreconstructed manhood, illustrating why there is much to do in furthering the male/female balance in today’s world. Despite some 70 years of full-on feminist rhetoric, we still bring up boys to be emotionally buttoned up and girls to remain painfully vulnerable to any emotional undercurrent. This male inability to express vulnerability, admit to weakness or talk honestly about feelings is the greatest obstacle to real emancipation and pervades the corridors of power and politics across the globe. How can we resolve the biggest issues of our time when the world is primarily run by a gender that struggles to communicate basic emotions? Love, fear, affection, sadness, depression and isolation are buried under a veneer of ability and control. It must be as exhausting for men as it is for the opposite sex.</p> \n<p>Responding to this pervasive cultural pressure to behave in a “manly” manner, my small foundation <a href=\"http://www.thegreatinitiative.org.uk/\">thegreatinitiative.org.uk</a> created a pilot project in London devoted to encouraging young men to see women as friends, not foes; to showing that an emotional life is a far richer one, and that women’s ability to show weakness, far from being worthy of disparagement, can actually be a strength. <a href=\"http://www.great-men.org/\">Great Men Value Women</a> works in schools training class ambassadors to host group talks where boys get to discuss their real feelings. Early findings suggest that it’s not only popular but creating positive change, and the most common emotion expressed by the boys in the pilot project is relief at being allowed to “open up”.</p> \n<p>That’s no help to your dad, who’s beyond their impressionable age. He’s your full unreconstructed behemoth, and when you are judging his feelings towards you it’s very important that you keep that in mind. Every term he uses about your mum is an emotionally distancing one. That doesn’t mean he doesn’t love her; in fact it makes it far more likely that he does. He simply can’t express himself in anything other than isolating, self-protective terms. I’m sure your dad also loves you, but he really doesn’t know how to manage or express it. He’s a product of his time and an example of why we need to make the world a more female-shaped place.</p> \n<p>Society accepts fathers who are “soft” on their little girls, so he was more comfortable back then, but as you’ve become a mature adult that dynamic has changed and he’s clueless how to bridge what appears an insurmountable divide. The only way to cross that Empty Quarter is to improve communication – and that is going to be up to you. Would it help to think of him as a foreign language speaker, a person with whom just a little tutoring could open up a whole new world? Your dad won’t know he’s got a problem, let alone how to fix it. To develop a relationship between you that’s even half as rewarding as the one you have with your mum, you’ll have to soften him up. He’s like some tragic caged gorilla destined forever to be segregated from his family. For every gruff word he utters, respond with a welcoming one; encourage him towards you by expressing yourself to him in the way you’d like him to respond. Knowing that underneath that Billy Goat Gruff exterior lie all the emotional undercurrents you yearn for will hopefully make it worth the initial arduous steps.</p> \n<p>You are definitely not unique, and watching other families from the outside very rarely gives a true picture – my husband and I were once so impressed by the caring, affectionate behaviour we witnessed in a visiting family that we resolved to end our incessant low-level bickering and behave in the manner of our guests. I’m afraid we failed, but as they separated within months of the visit their tenure as role models also ended! I haven’t the slightest shred of doubt your father is crazy about you and your mother; he just needs you to walk towards him with your arms open so he feels secure enough to tell you.</p> \n<p><br />If you have a dilemma, send a brief email to <a href=\"mailto:mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk\">mariella.frostrup@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Mariella on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariellaf1\">@mariellaf1</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436274892601/d4920f6b-79c9-456a-a91b-b2dad7b86021-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":207,"width":345,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"SCPhotographie/Getty Images","altText":"Father holding daughter in lake, seen from the back","cleanCredit":"Photograph: SCPhotographie/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T04:59:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T04:59:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":124,"contributors":[{"name":"Mariella Frostrup","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/1/13/1421154121982/Mariella-Frostrup-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/mariellafrostrup"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Parents and parenting","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Mariella Frostrup","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/mariellafrostrup"}}],"series":{"title":"Dear Mariella","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/dearmariella"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/dad-never-show-love-respect-mariella-frostrup","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aeex","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/dad-never-show-love-respect-mariella-frostrup","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/dad-never-show-love-respect-mariella-frostrup"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436274892601/d4920f6b-79c9-456a-a91b-b2dad7b86021-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":207,"width":345,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Society accepts fathers who are “soft” on their little girls, so your dad was more comfortable back then.

Pity it didn’t sink on the way…</p>","byline":"Jay Rayner","body":"<h2>Adelphi Building, John Adam Street, London WC2 (020 7321 6007). Meal for two, including drinks and service: &pound;225<br /></h2> \n<p><br />Cooking a steak well is tricky, because you cannot see inside the meat. It takes experience and knowledge. Cooking chips is easy: use the right potatoes, give them a couple of runs through the hot oil, make sure they’re the right colour, perhaps even taste a couple. The job is done. At <a href=\"http://www.smithandwollensky.co.uk/\">Smith &amp; Wollensky</a>, the new London outpost of a well-known small American steakhouse chain, we sent back the chips because they were tepid and under-cooked. They returned to us hot and undercooked. And in that one example of carelessness and lack of attention to detail, you know all you need to.</p> \n<p>But I had to sit through the whole damn meal so I don’t see why you shouldn’t, too. This US business has swaggered into London like it thinks it’s the bollocks. The description is almost right, if you remove the definite article before the reference to testicles. It is about as shoddy an operation in separating people from inexcusable amounts of their cash as I have seen in a very long time.</p> \n<p>But first a little context. Until about a decade ago Britain was crying out for a proper steakhouse on the American model; one that knew how to source beef, cut steaks thick enough and char them properly. Endless feeble attempts came and went. Then we got both <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2009/mar/08/goodman-restaurant-london\">Goodman</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2012/nov/18/jay-rayner-restaurant-hawksmoor-air-street\">Hawksmoor</a>, the latter adopting all the tropes of the US steakhouse, but giving them a pronounced British accent. It put prime cuts of British beef centre stage.</p> \n<p>And now comes Smith &amp; Wollensky (hereafter S&amp;W), which bellows loudly about importing US Department of Agriculture beef from Iowa, but which is backed by a consortium from Ireland, a country which produces some of the best beef in the world. They have spent a reputed €10m, and you can see where every cent has gone. The conversion of the basement and ground floor space of the 1930s New York pastiche Adelphi Building just behind the Strand is an orgy of leather and wood, of brass rail and tasteful mural. It can seat 300 people. Across 14 services a week I calculate they will need to find roughly 4,000 people able to pay the prices required to return that investment.</p> \n<p>Cocktails are &pound;13. That buys me an insipid Moscow Mule served in a stupid brass mug with a thin plastic straw. Five pleasant enough medium-sized seared scallops with shards of crisp bacon are &pound;18; four jumbo prawns are &pound;14. Except they don’t call them prawns, because despite the London setting the place must have a transatlantic drawl. So prawns are shrimps and all steaks are listed in imperial measurements. The USDA cuts include a 24oz bone-in ribeye and a 21oz sirloin. The prices for these are astonishing. The former is &pound;65, the latter &pound;62. To put this in context, at Hawksmoor the bone-in sirloin is &pound;5.60 per 100gm. At S&amp;W it’s &pound;10.42 per 100gm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a3922ec825662746ea984ba69e4d6269da1bc46\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282247183/365ed920-9950-4831-86eb-17acddbf07a7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Smith &amp; Wollensky's bone-in ribeye steak next to sauces in pots and a knife\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The char is feeble, the overwhelming taste is of salt, and the texture is floppy’: Smith &amp; Wollensky’s bone-in ribeye steak. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Is that simply because it has travelled? Not if the fillet steak prices are anything to go by, because S&amp;W have sourced those from the UK. At Hawksmoor fillet is &pound;11.33 per 100gm; at S&amp;W it’s &pound;14.55. Both the menu blurb and the waiting staff bang on about this being the best steak you will ever have. The menu also mentions a list of blackboard specials – T-bones and so on – all of which have run out by 8.20pm. We order the bone-in ribeye. The char is feeble and the overwhelming taste is of salt. Worse is the texture. It’s floppy. Part of this, I think, is a cultural difference; Americans like to celebrate steaks based on tenderness, as if being able to cut a piece of dead animal with a butter knife is an aspiration. I think that if you’re going to eat beef, you want to know it has come from an animal that has moved. This steak slips down like something that has spent its life chained to a radiator in the basement.</p> \n<p>The sauces are dire. A b&eacute;arnaise is an insult to the name, lacking any acidity or the anise burst of tarragon. An au poivre sauce is just a shot of hot demi-glace. A side salad is crisp and well dressed. We take comfort in it. Many other sides are priced for two which is a quick route to higher profit margins and greater food waste. The &pound;9 battered onion rings are good; the &pound;10 truffled mac and cheese is dry and tastes not at all of truffle. Those terrible chips come in the kind of mini-chip-fat-fryer-basket used at chain pubs.</p> \n<p>Service is omnipresent. Twice we ask to keep our bread and side plates when they attempt to remove them. When a third waiter lunges in I finally admit defeat. Take them if you’re so bloody desperate. How hard is it to communicate a table’s wishes to the half dozen people working a corner of the floor, especially when a meal is going to cost more than &pound;100 a head?</p> \n<p>Our waitress, an escapee from Hawksmoor, is lovely – efficient, charming and utterly wasted here. She has been sent out on to the floor in a jacket she admits is about three sizes too large for her and is already stained. Either the management gives a damn about the dignity of its staff or it really doesn’t. Still, she speaks fluent Smith &amp; Wollensky, intoning the oft-repeated figure that theirs are the best 2% of all USDA steaks. God help the other 98%. We try to love it, really we do, but we just can’t. Clearly the poor animal died twice: once in the slaughter house, once on the grill. We give up and hope she doesn’t look too distraught. Curiously, the menu announces in small print that items “may” be cooked to order. May? Only <em>may</em>? Don’t put yourself out, guys.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"faa1e2dd4f50f351a89e80aff4e195ec43eb42ed\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282525577/f84b8aea-cfaa-4466-8df4-f2be77471b1b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Slice of rich layered chocolate cake next to a cow-shaped biscuit, some cream and raspberries, blueberries, strawberries\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The chocolate cake – ‘an obscenity’, according to Jay.

It comes with a mini milk urn full of chilled lightly whipped and sweetened cream. That cream is by far the best thing we eat all night. The cake is an obscenity, a foul, brusque monolith of heavy sponge and cack-handed mousse almost a foot high. It tastes of fat and sugar and disdain. It eats like those showpiece cakes that have sat for years in coffee shop windows look. We are told there is an option to take left-overs home. We choose not to. The last thing we want, as we walk out the door, is to take any part of the dreadful Smith &amp; Wollensky experience with us.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s new bites</h2> \n<p>■ At the other end of the expense scale, Grillshack on London’s Beak Street serves a quick-seared piece of flattened rump, with shoestring potatoes and smoked butter for just &pound;9.95. It keeps prices down with new tech: although you can order at the counter you can also do so from a downloadable app. Food is then brought to you. There’s mac and cheese, buttermilk chicken, and an American pancake menu. It more than ticks the box marked cheap and cheerful (<a href=\"http://www.grillshack.com/\">grillshack.com</a>).</p> \n<p>■ People of Ilkley rejoice.

Its as if the Statue of Liberty had been discovered to have cloven hooves.</p> \n<p>Lee’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/ng-interactive/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-read-the-first-chapter\">much-anticipated new book, Go Set a Watchman</a>, was actually written before the publication of her masterpiece in 1960. The manuscript contained a series of flashbacks to the early life of its heroine, Scout Finch, and her publisher, who was intrigued by the vivid picture they painted, suggested the author should go away and write another novel based on those passages.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/ng-interactive/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-read-the-first-chapter\">Go Set A Watchman: read the first chapter - interactive</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Lee’s rewrite, Mockingbird, went on to win the Pulitzer prize. In 1962 it was turned into a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jul/11/playing-scout-to-kill-mockingbird-changed-my-life-mary-badham\">well-loved film starring Gregory Peck and Mary Badham</a> and it was recently described by Oprah Winfrey as “our national book”. It tells the story of Scout and her brother, Jem, and the life they shared 20 years earlier in the small town of Maycomb, Alabama, with their widower father, Atticus. A lawyer, their father has to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, from a rape charge and his fair-minded humanitarian attitudes, as represented to the reader through the eyes of his loving young daughter, have since <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jul/11/shami-chakrabarti-kill-mockingbird-made-me-lawyer\">spawned a million legal careers</a>.</p> \n<p>Breaking an international embargo, the New York Times ran a review on Saturday revealing the contents of Watchman and the news that Atticus Finch, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2014/jul/24/gregory-peck-to-kill-a-mockingbird-atticus-finch-role-model\">a hero of American liberal values</a>, had been conceived as a flawed racist has upset many fans of Lee’s original book.</p> \n<p>The Rev Al Sharpton, veteran civil rights activist and Baptist minister, told the Observer that the portrayal of Atticus in Watchman chimed with his own experience of some postwar American liberals. “To Kill A Mockingbird has always been the standard we talked about in American literature in dealing with the question of race and racial justice,” said Sharpton. “Now to find out that Atticus Finch was not this statesmanlike racial hero, but was in fact portrayed at first by Harper Lee as racist in many ways, reflects the burden we’ve had in real life of the northern liberal who ended up being racist.</p> \n<p>“When I was a kid and Dr King was dealing with raw racism in the south, the northern liberals supported him. But when I came of age and started fighting racism in the north, some of the liberals who supported the generation before me were the ones I had to fight in police brutality cases … Finch reflects the reality of finding out that a lot of those we thought were on our side harboured some personal different feelings.”</p> \n<p>Sharpton added: “I think the irony of this revelation is it reflects much of the reality of what I’ve seen in the civil rights movement in the 21st century.”</p> \n<p>The Observer’s chief literary commentator, Robert McCrum, said: “Reading Go Set A Watchman is a strange experience. It’s not Mockingbird – how could it be? – and its language, values and ethos are irredeemably dated. Race relations have thankfully come a long way since the days of the civil rights movement.</p> \n<p>“It’s inevitable that the unrevised sentiments of Scout and especially Atticus, that passionate advocate, should strike a discordant note in 2015. A vital literary organ, detached from its living contemporary context, runs as much risk of rejection as a transplanted heart in an alien body.</p> \n<p>“As a fan of Mockingbird, I will probably not be alone in regretting her publisher’s decision to subject a frail old writer and her lost manuscript to the unforgiving climate of the contemporary book world.”</p> \n<p>The announcement in February that Lee’s first work about Finch and Scout would be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jul/02/harper-lee-go-set-a-watchman-manuscript-discovery\">released so many years later</a> was greeted with a mixture of joy and apprehension by her fans. The author, 89, lives in an assisted living facility in her home town of Monroeville, Alabama, and there was concern that she had not understood that she was giving permission to her publisher to bring out her earlier, unpublished work. Her lawyer, literary agent and publisher have since insisted that Lee was entirely behind the much-delayed release of Watchman.</p> \n<p>It is set in Maycomb in a period in which the civil rights movement was taking hold. In February, Lee said she was “humbled and amazed” that readers would meet the grownup Scout, now known as Jean Louise, for the first time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-first-chapter-review-moving-reunion-harper-lee\">Go Set a Watchman's first chapter, first review: a beguiling journey into the past</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Among other suprises contained in the early pages of the book are the fact that Scout’s brother, Jem, is dead and that the elderly Atticus is plagued by rheumatoid arthritis.

It’s a very simple idea, the room never changes as he’s interviewed all the time on camera. He’s a real storyteller and speaks in this fascinating way. He’s compelling to watch.

It’s like sportsmen and women, they start younger and younger. The training is more specific and they can go professional from a younger age. It seems as if there’s a generation of kids who have grown up with more awareness of food trends. As for myself, I have very simple tastes in food.
