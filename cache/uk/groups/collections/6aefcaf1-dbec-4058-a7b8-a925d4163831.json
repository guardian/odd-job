Forensics specialists in black sleeveless jackets peered into the soil looking for a flash of white bone. The police leant on their patrol car, sweating in the noon heat.</p> \n<p>The massacres in Srebrenica were committed 20 years ago next week. Commemorations around the world will include a memorial service in Westminster Abbey on Monday, and dignitaries will gather at the huge graveyard near the old United Nations base in Potocari.<br /></p> \n<p>But the place is still an active crime scene. It refuses to slip into history. Some crimes are so vast, so devastating, so shocking, they are never truly over. The case is never closed. Pain seeps out through decades and generations. At least that how it feels to the survivors, the families of the dead, who gather at the police tape, waiting to see whose bones will rise from the ground.</p> \n<p>It is as hot and humid now as it was in July 1995, when more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys were executed in the fields around Srebrenica. After a morning of tearing at the same ground two decades on, the digger overheated and had to be rested. The driver, the police and investigators retired to the cafe of a nearby petrol station to wait. Among them was Amor Masovic, the chairman of the Bosnian Missing Persons Institute, the man entrusted by the state with the endless task of accounting for the dead.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0cd79375f81100075056b47105a7a8f1d9a3fe88\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435877201746/3081a65b-cebb-49ed-8c8f-cdb7fd4f216c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hajra Catic (right) and Edmin Jakubovic search for the remains of her son at the location where Jakubovic last saw him wounded.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hajra Catic (right) and Edmin Jakubovic search for the remains of her son at the location where Jakubovic last saw him wounded.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>By the reckoning of Masovic’s institute, the remains of 7,100 of the dead have been found out of total of 8,372 missing. The International Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP), which is helping with the DNA identification work, has similar figures. That leaves some 1,200 people left to find, and many more surviving relatives in perpetual agony. They call Masovic all the time, asking for news.</p> \n<p>But these last bodies are the hardest to find. </p> \n<p>After the Srebrenica genocide, the Bosnian Serb wartime leadership ordered the graves dug up and the corpses reburied in a bid to conceal them. The job was done with bulldozers and trucks, breaking up bodies in the process.</p> \n<p>“We are the first generation in human civilization in which bodies are buried and then dug up and scattered,” Masovic said. “As far as I know, no one else did this.”</p> \n<p>He tells the story of one man, Kadrija Music, who had been 23 at the time of the massacre. Six of his bones were found in five different locations up to 32km apart.</p> \n<p>The discovery of new bones can bring peace to some families while stealing it away from others. If they belong to someone whose partial remains have already been found, mothers and widows are faced with the choice of leaving the new bones in communal graves, or digging up their dead son or husband so that he can be reburied in more complete form. Most choose the latter path, even though the same torment could be repeated again and again.</p> \n<p>Hajra Catic can only dream of such dilemmas. She would love to have the choice of where to bury her son, Nino, who disappeared at the age of 26. He had been the town’s radio operator who had sent out its last forlorn appeals for help. When Srebrenica fell, he was one of thousands of local men who opted to flee into the wooded mountains rather than trust their lives to the Serb forces or their supposed UN protectors. Along the way, the fugitives had to cross mined frontlines, and face one ambush after another while mortar and artillery shells slashed through the trees around them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7690c234fdd8600e0cc967b9f4435993d7aaf5e0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435877541176/7f3cdfb4-0b49-4107-b1ec-646005be1e4d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Refugees from Srebrenica at a UN base 60 miles north of Sarajevo in 1995.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugees from Srebrenica at a UN base 60 miles north of Sarajevo in 1995.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Darko Bandic/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The woods are still being demined, and as they are cleared, more bones are found strewn in the undergrowth. Catic was told that the remains of five people were found in recent months and only two have so far been identified so far. She believes Nino could be one of the remaining three. She is waiting for her phone to ring.</p> \n<p>“I live for that call. Every year I think this is the year I will bury my son,” she said. She knows that particular mix of despair and relief, from the time she got a call about her husband, Junuz, who was shot in one of the mass executions and whose body was eventually found in 2005 with many others, under a rubbish heap in the nearby town of Kozluk. She has left a space next to Junuz for their son.</p> \n<p>“When the call comes, your memory goes straight back to 95,” Catic said. “It is a terrible thing but I wish Nino was in a mass grave. Then I would know where he was. Every night I wake up thinking about him. For us, this is not history. For us, it’s like it happened yesterday.”</p> \n<p>For years, she had been pushing the authorities to get the demining done. In 2012, she gave up waiting and went into the woods with one of Nino’s friends who was prepared to take the risk.</p> \n<p>“He took me to the place they said they had seen Nino wounded from a mortar,” she said. “It was mined all around. I tried to clear the surface looking for something, but I found nothing. But walking back I found a skull by a creek. I couldn’t leave it there. I put in a bag and took it back. It stayed in my study for 18 months before anyone came to pick it up.”</p> \n<p>The skull did not belong to Nino, but to a teenage boy. One of the survivors from the long trek through the mountains, Muhamed Durakovic, had seen the boy with his father, Kemal Hajdarovic, in the woods.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ea9416a97ea8173936e73e7f07ce77cffb2d6e6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435877926030/c8c41815-3799-4da3-8202-2c59778822b3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A forensic anthropologist from the International Commission on Missing Persons looks at a skull that Hajra (right) found in the woods.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A forensic anthropologist from the International Commission on Missing Persons looks at a skull that Hajra (right) found in the woods.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I asked Kemal why he had brought the boy – he was only 12 or 13. “’Yes, but he’s tall for his age,’ he told me,” recalled Durakovic. Hajdarovic had feared his son’s height would get him killed. In the woods in July 1995, both father and son died.</p> \n<p>Durakovic spent 37 days wandering in the woods. He now works for the ICMP. He never saw Nino Catic, whom he knew well, in all that time, and believes his mother may be looking in the wrong place.</p> \n<p>Amor Masovic believes the missing 1,200 are somewhere in the mountains or in secondary graves, where the Bosnian Serb army reburied the corpses they had disinterred. In June he and his team were looking at the steep hillsides around the village of Glogova, where remains had been tipped out of trucks and allowed to roll down a gorge.</p> \n<p>As they worked, a schoolboy on his way home on a mountain road waited patiently for them to finish so that he could pass. His name was Suad Mujic, and he was born five years after the end of the war. His parents had escaped to the city of Tuzla and then returned to the village in 2004 to pick up their old lives. Suad’s grandfather, grandmother and 21-year-old aunt had been killed, and their bodies were later found in different sites in the vicinity. His walk to school is literally through a killing field. <br /></p> \n<p>“From time to time I think about it if I’m walking home alone,” the 15-year-old said. But he thought more Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) families should return. “It’s a good place, and we are coming back to our property to prove it belongs to us.”</p> \n<p>He has Serb friends, but they never talk about what happened in July 1995.</p> \n<p>“If we want to talk about [it], the Serb teachers at school take their side. They want to diminish it, as if never happened.”</p> \n<p>The same rule applies across Srebrenica municipality. Because of the numbers of Bosniaks who insisted on returning and the unusual degree of international protection they received from the international community, it is one of the very few mixed municipalities in the Republika Srpska (RS), the Serb half of Bosnia that was carved up by ethnic cleansing but accepted as part of the 1995 peace agreement. It is the only town in the RS with a Bosniak mayor, partly due to the fact that even those Bosniak families that did not return made sure they registered for the municipal elections and outvoted Serbs, who make up 55% of the 8,000 population.</p> \n<p>A Bosnian flag flies outside Srebrenica town hall, an extreme rarity for the RS, and a Serb deputy mayor and other Serb officials work alongside their Bosniak colleagues. But the cohabitation is a veneer.</p> \n<p>In the office of Nermin Alivukovic, the mayor’s chief of staff, there is nothing to show that anything out of the ordinary happened in Srebrenica, as it would be viewed as provocative.</p> \n<p>“You can talk about anything but when you start talking about 95, that’s the end of the conversation,” Alivukovic said. “Before each anniversary on 11 July, you can feel the tension rising. The Serbs start withdrawing socially and stop talking or hanging out with us.”</p> \n<p>In an office a few feet down the corridor, the Serb head of the municipal council, Milos Milovanovic, said he had no intention of attending ceremonies to mark the 20th anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre.</p> \n<p>“No Bosniaks ever come to remember the Serb dead,” Milovanovic said. The Serbs have begun holding rival ceremonies for their own dead in northeast Bosnia, which they estimate at 3,700 over the course of the war, mostly soldiers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80fce32715859cf4e1af15f03587b81c27c69081\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435878155249/9d36b9de-d8e4-4910-b69e-652a63a50b6c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hajra Catic and Edmin Jakubovic look at pictures of Hajra's son at her home in Srebrenica.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hajra Catic and Edmin Jakubovic look at pictures of Hajra’s son at her home in Srebrenica.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As for the question of whether the massacre of the 8,000 men and boys happened, Milovanovic, a former Bosnian Serb soldier, is hazy.</p> \n<p>“I think there should be a joint commission to investigate what really happened,” he said. “We can’t speculate about numbers. Even one victim is too much.”</p> \n<p>Soldiers from Milovanic’s unit, the Bratunace brigade, took an important role in the mass executions, but he says he was transferred to another front as Srebrenica fell, and was not present in the bloody aftermath.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/law/2013/nov/10/bosnia-syria-victims-of-genocide-dna\">From Bosnia to Syria: the investigators identifying victims of genocide</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Bosnian Serb leader, Milorad Dodik, has become increasingly assertive in questioning the fact of the Srebrenica killings.

In the cafe across the road from the municipal hall, an unemployed Serb metalworker, Srdjan Jovanovic, bemoaned the death of town. Many of the workers in government jobs live elsewhere and after 5pm, the place is ghostly. There is no longer a bakery or butcher. He acknowledged that many of his Bosniak neighbours are gone never to return, but bristled at the suggestion of massacres and Srebrenica.</p> \n<p>“What happened, if it happened,” Jovanovic was careful to say before any mention of the subject.

The sort of hangover where every internal organ is competing for the title of “biggest source of wretchedness”. The sort of hangover where your own skull seems to be angry at you. The sort of hangover where even attempting a sip of water feels like trying to down a cocktail of rancid milk and toilet cleaner. </p> \n<p>This isn’t exactly the sort of thing you want to be going through when it’s so hot outside that your car tyres are melting. But I did. Because I’m awesome like that. </p> \n<p>For many this would seem like a wasted day, lying on the bed hoping to die for nine hours, rather than going out and enjoying the weather, but according to scientific evidence it may have been the wisest course of action overall. Despite the fact that people (in the UK at least) regularly long for hot weather and will travel great distances to find it, the notion that hot weather makes people more aggressive and violent is a well-known one in the psychology field. You may have experienced it yourself; online discussions taking a more hostile turn faster than normal, people being more short-tempered than usual, even things like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_England_riots\">2011 London riots</a> often take place in high summer.</p> \n<p>We have a decent idea of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/brain-flapping/2013/aug/06/anger-aggression-psychology-screw-you\">how anger works</a>, and how it <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/brain-flapping/2015/apr/29/outrage-public-widespread-anger-is-so-common-psychology\">spreads far and wide</a>.

So what’s the link between all these things? Why would hot temperatures make us so hot tempered? </p> \n<p>This is a tricky question. The original data, which first provided evidence for this relationship between heat and hostility, came from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2012/jul/10/are-heatwaves-hotbed-for-crime\">crime statistics</a>. Many reports and analyses noticed that crimes, particularly violent crimes, <a href=\"http://www.thewire.com/national/2011/07/how-severe-link-between-hot-weather-and-violence/40325/\">increase in occurrence during the summer</a>, especially if it’s hotter than average.</p> \n<p>However, there are many things that could explain this; people are outside a lot more during the hot weather, so there is a drastically increased chance of people meeting each other in circumstances that would result in a violent altercation (i.e. if you’re the sort of person who’d pick a fight with someone who spilled your beer, the more people there are the more likely your beer is to be spilled). Also, criminals are often opportunists; thieves will rob homes and steal wallets when the opportunity arises, and it arises more often as people are out and about, enjoying the warmth. </p> \n<p>Added to this, schools are closed for summer, meaning hordes of adolescents are left to roam the streets with <a href=\"http://www.nasponline.org/resources/principals/nasp_aggression.pdf\">their rebellious, aggressive tendencies</a>. With all this to consider, no wonder there’s a spike in the stats! Especially in cities, which are <a href=\"http://www.epa.gov/heatisland/\">usually much warmer</a> than elsewhere.<br /></p> \n<p>But according to many, this <a href=\"http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/10/1/33.abstract\">isn’t enough to explain the actual data</a>. Ergo, it’s widely believed that heat makes people angrier by more “direct” methods. There <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/bul/106/1/74/\">are numerous theories</a> for why this might happen. </p> \n<p>Some argue that the physiological reactions to heat are responsible. Raised temperatures cause an increase in heart rate, testosterone, and <a href=\"http://www.crestadvisory.com/hot-weather-high-crime/\">other metabolic reactions</a> that trigger the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/terms/sympathetic_nervous_system.htm\">sympathetic nervous system</a>, which is responsible for the fight-or-flight response, so people are more inclined to fight. </p> \n<p>There are also numerous psychological theories. One is based on discomfort; unless you have access to climate control technology like air conditioning, it’s very hard to escape the heat. If it’s cold you can wear more layers, but high temperatures follow you everywhere, <a href=\"http://www.hse.gov.uk/temperature/thermal/factors.htm\">especially if it’s humid</a>. When people are experiencing discomfort and the resultant stress due to something they have no control over, it makes them angry, and the anger is often <a href=\"http://changingminds.org/explanations/behaviors/coping/displacement.htm\">displaced</a> onto something else, like someone being irritating in the street. </p> \n<p>This has also lead into other applications and theories, like the <a href=\"http://www.psych-it.com.au/Psychlopedia/article.asp?id=121\">cognitive neoassociation theory</a>, which argues that people exposed to unpleasant “negative” stimuli will be predisposed to anyone they associate with the unpleasant thing, which in the heat is potentially everything. </p> \n<p>A number of experiments have looked into this, with varying degrees of success. This is understandable, it’s very hard to recreate the experience of oppressive, inescapable heat in a lab, which are invariably climate controlled and forbidden from preventing people from leaving. However, some original and inspired approaches have been used, like measuring the tendency of people to honk at traffic lights in <a href=\"http://eab.sagepub.com/content/18/2/179.short\">certain weather conditions</a>. </p> \n<p>Much of the field of psychology is taken up with debating whether the heat equals aggression link <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/89/1/71/\">declines again above a certain point or not</a> (ie it eventually gets so hot it suppresses people’s actions), but there’s not much to dispute that it’s a real thing, it’s more a matter of how it occurs and what it actually does to us. There are many other possibilities than those mentioned, like how regulating your body temperature requires energy, energy which is no longer available for <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ab.20366/abstract\">suppressing aggressive impulses</a>, and thus they occur a lot more in people. Or maybe people are just more angry as they’re not <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/brain-flapping/2014/jun/18/how-to-get-the-perfect-beach-body-with-science\">beach body ready</a> and are thus infuriated. </p> \n<p>This isn’t to say that anyone who lives in a hot country is automatically more aggressive than those who live at higher latitudes, it’s more to do with <em>relatively</em> high temperatures. In any case, if you’re feeling overheated in the weather, you might want to try keeping a tighter hold on your temper. There’s barely enough cool to go around as it is, you don’t want to go losing yours.</p> \n<p><em>Dean Burnett tends to get sunburn from an overly bright light bulb, so isn’t the biggest fan of heatwaves as it is.

All issues are human resource issues, and human resources itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.</em></p> \n<p>OK, that’s not exactly what Orwell wrote. The hair-splitters among you will moan that I’ve taken the word “politics” out of the above and replaced it with “human resources”. Sorry.</p> \n<p>But I think there’s no denying that had he been alive today, Orwell – the great opponent and satirist of totalitarianism – would have deplored the bureaucratic repression of HR. He would have hated their blind loyalty to power, their unquestioning faithfulness to process, their abhorrence of anything or anyone deviating from the mean. </p> \n<p>In particular, Orwell would have utterly despised the language that HR people use. In his excellent essay <a href=\"http://www.orwell.ru/library/essays/politics/english/e_polit/\">Politics and the English Language</a> (where he began the thought that ended with Newspeak), Orwell railed against the language crimes committed by politicians.</p> \n<p><em>In our time, political speech and writing are largely the defence of the indefensible … Thus political language has to consist largely of euphemism, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness. Defenceless villages are bombarded from the air, the inhabitants driven out into the countryside, the cattle machine-gunned, the huts set on fire with incendiary bullets: this is called pacification. Millions of peasants are robbed of their farms and sent trudging along the roads with no more than they can carry: this is called transfer of population or rectification of frontiers. People are imprisoned for years without trial, or shot in the back of the neck or sent to die of scurvy in Arctic lumber camps: this is called elimination of unreliable elements. </em></p> \n<p>Repeat the politics/human resources switch in the above and the argument remains broadly the same. Yes, HR is not explaining away murders, but it nonetheless deliberately misuse language as a sort of low-tech mind control to avert our eyes from office atrocities and keep us fixed on our inboxes. Thus mass sackings are wrapped up in cowardly sophistry and called <em>rightsizings</em>, individuals are <em>offboarded</em> to the jobcentre and the few hardy souls left are consoled by their membership of a more <em>streamlined</em> organisation. </p> \n<p>Orwell would have despised the passive constructions that are the HR department’s default setting. Want some flexibility in your contract? HR says <em>company policy is unable to support that</em>. Forgotten to accede to some arbitrary and impractical office rule? HR says <em>we are minded to ask everyone to remember that it is essential to comply by rule X</em>. Try to question whether an ill-judged commitment could be reversed? HR apologises meekly that <em>the decision has been made.</em> </p> \n<p>Not giving subjects to any of these responses is a deliberate ploy. Subjects give ownership. They imbue accountability. Not giving sentences subjects means that HR is passing the buck, but to no one in particular. And with no subject, no one can be blamed, or protested against. </p> \n<p>The passive construction is also designed to give the sense that it’s not HR speaking, but that they are the conduit for a higher-up and incontestable power. It’s designed to be both authoritative and banal, so that we torpidly accept it, like the sovereignty of the Queen. It’s saying: “This is the way things are – deal with it because it isn’t changing.” It’s indifferent and deliberately opaque. It’s the worst kind of utopianism (the kind <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/06/the-utopia-of-rules-on-technology-stupidity-and-the-secret-joys-of-bureaucracy-david-graeber-review\">David Graeber targets in his recent book</a> on “stupidity and the secret joys of bureaucracy”), where system and rule are king and hang the individual. It’s deeply, deeply oppressive.</p> \n<p><em>Annual leave</em> is perhaps an even worse example of HR’s linguistic malpractice. The phrase gives the sense that we are not sitting in the office but rather fighting some dismal war and that we should be grateful for the mercy of Field Marshal HR in allowing us a finite absence from the front line. Is it too indulgent and too frivolous to say that we are going on holiday (even if we’re just taking the day to go to Ikea)? Would it so damage our career prospects? Would the emerging markets of the world be emboldened by the decadence and complacency of saying we’re going on hols? I don’t think so, but <em>they</em> clearly do.</p> \n<p>Actually, I don’t think it’s so much of a stretch to imagine Orwell himself establishing the whole HR enterprise as a sort of grim parody of Stalinism; a never-ending, ever-expanding live action art installation sequel to Animal Farm and Nineteen Eighty-Four. </p> \n<p>Look at your office’s internal newsletter. Is it an incomprehensible black hole of sense? Is it trying to prod you into a place of content, incognisant of all the everyday hardships and irritations you endure? If your answer is yes, then I think that like me, you find it fairly easy to imagine Orwell composing these Newspeak emails from beyond the grave to make us believe that War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery and 2+2=5.</p> \n<p>Delving deeper, the parallels become increasingly hard to ignore. Company restructures and key performance indicators make no sense in the abstract, merely serving to demotivate the workforce, sap confidence and obstruct productivity. So are they actually cleverly designed parodies of Stalin’s purges and the cult of Stakhanovism? </p> \n<p>Could the industry’s name itself – human resources – be an Orwellian slight? A wink-wink label designed to conjure up images of the pigs of Animal Farm harvesting the life force of their lackeys? I’m only half joking.</p> \n<p>If all this is depressing, then it’s not meant to be. Orwell’s essay was meant positively: he wanted us to believe that better writing and better use of language can result in a better society.</p> \n<p><em>The point is that the process is reversible. Modern English, especially written English, is full of bad habits which spread by imitation and which can be avoided if one is willing to take the necessary trouble.

In fact, the lyrics were little more than a clever composite of stray couplets heard in the clubs of Memphis and the streets of St Louis. As for the music, jazz pianist Jelly Roll Morton fired the first salvo at Handy’s lilywhite reputation in a 1938 Downbeat article, suggesting: “Mr Handy cannot prove anything is music that he has created. [Rather,] he has taken advantage of some unprotected material … [because of] a greed for false reputation.” Handy’s printed retort was that at least he “had vision enough to copyright and publish all the music I wrote, so I don’t have to go around saying I made up this piece and that piece in such and such a year … Nobody has swiped anything from me.”</p> \n<h2><strong>2. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzQ8GDBA8Is\"><strong>Hound Dog</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eaa98f6a7a8f603d9555ed95db04e40817632d42\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435856550803/2b6a5e09-ad9c-4714-a2e0-11d2f9f1317c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jerry Leiber with Elvis Presley and Mike Stoller.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jerry Leiber with Elvis Presley and Mike Stoller.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hound Dog provided Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller with a crash-course in R&amp;B publishing. No sooner had they written it, in 1952, than it was copyrighted to Don Robey, who owned Peacock Records, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxoGvBQtjpM\">Big Mama Thornton, who recorded it</a>. The culprit was producer Johnny Otis, to whom Leiber and Stoller had contracted their songs in the hope of breaking into the industry. As Stoller later told their biographer: “The reality of the cold-blooded music business was something else. Later, we learned that Johnny Otis [had] put his name on the song as a composer and indicated to Don Robey, the label owner, that he, Johnny, had power of attorney to sign for us as well.” Otis insisted to his dying day he rewrote the words, which originally “had lyrics about knives and scars, all negative stereotypes”. He even took the pair to court when Elvis covered it, having previously signed a release renouncing all claims to the song in exchange for $750. His claim was roundly dismissed, the New York federal judge branding him “unworthy of belief”.</p> \n<h2><strong>3. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWwgrjjIMXA\"><strong>Blowin’ in the Wind</strong></a></h2> \n<p>Like Shakespeare before him, the first time Bob Dylan achieved public notoriety was as a “thief of thoughts” in an October 1963 Newsweek feature that suggested there was a “rumour circulating that Dylan did not write Blowin’ in the Wind, that it was written by a Millburn [New Jersey] high-school student named Lorre Wyatt, who sold it to the singer … Wyatt denies authorship, but several Millburn students claim they heard the song from Wyatt before Dylan ever sang it.”</p> \n<p>Dylan’s naive decision to publish the song in a folkzine, Broadside, a full year before he released it gave Wyatt the opportunity to claim it for his own. Wyatt played it to his band in October 1962, nine whole months before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ld6fAO4idaI\">Peter, Paul and Mary made it a hit</a>. When asked where he got it from, Wyatt claimed to have written it. Surprisingly, when the Newsweek story was published, Dylan did not sue, but it would take Wyatt until 1974 to come clean. Dylan might have been sued himself over the song had he not wisely dropped its fourth verse, a straight lift from Joe Hayes and Jack Rhodes’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyYCClHDrmU\">A Satisfied Mind, a song owned by the notoriously litigious Porter Wagoner</a>. The tune itself, of course, was never Dylan’s. As the folk singer Pete Seeger noted, the night it debuted, it was a clever rearrangement of the traditional anti-slavery song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhMEnGxX1BI\">No More Auction Block</a>.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRXb7K7k7bQ\"><strong>House of the Rising Sun</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0dc9d5e5224caec003f84fff715c0d7e1869a3d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435856806361/2d13e6be-fde5-4625-ba9c-deeb8757a9f9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bob Dylan failed to copyright his arrangement of House of the Rising Sun.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Dylan failed to copyright his arrangement of House of the Rising Sun.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/John Cohen</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When Dylan failed to copyright his arrangement <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ZYLTGu4E\">(which was actually Dave Van Ronk’s)</a> of the 19th-century folksong House of the Rising Sun <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NX2ZYLTGu4E\">he left the Animals free to claim the electric arrangement</a> they based on his as their own. In fact, only the Animals’ organist Alan Price had his name attached to “their” arrangement. The song went to No 1 on both sides of the Atlantic, and Price was suddenly a very wealthy man. Another American folk doyen was incensed to find he was entitled to nothing: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/shortcuts/2012/mar/05/alan-lomax-hebrides-recordings\">Alan Lomax claimed he found</a> the song first, in 1937, via “a pretty, yellow-headed miner’s daughter in Middlesboro, Kentucky, subsequently adapting it to the form ... popularised by Josh White.” He did nothing of the sort; White learned the song from “a white hillbilly singer in North Carolina”. White’s minor-key variant was the one Van Ronk, Dylan and the Animals appropriated. Moreover, the song had already been recorded three times before White got to it. Try as he might, there was no way Lomax could cut himself a slice of a song to which he did not contribute a single note or word.</p> \n<h2><strong>5.</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehwSEVbBZl4\"><strong>Dazed and Confused</strong></a></h2> \n<p>The idea for Led Zeppelin was one Jimmy Page had been carrying around for years: the problem was not finding the musicians, but original material. Yet, when the first Led Zeppelin album appeared, there were all these songs credited in some part to Page, including compositions by folkie Anne Borden and bluesmen Howlin’ Wolf and Willie Dixon, all still alive, all recopyrighted to Page et al. His most brazen acquisition, though, was Dazed and Confused, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTsvs-pAGDc\">a song by Jake Holmes</a>. The one time he was asked about the song, he squirmed: “I’d rather not get into it because I don’t know all the circumstances. What’s he got, the riff or whatever? Because Robert [Plant] wrote some of the lyrics for that on the album … We extended it from one that we were playing with the Yardbirds. I haven’t heard Jake Holmes.” Actually, Plant hadn’t written a single word of the song and, if he had, he wasn’t credited. Only Page was. As for never hearing Jake Holmes, the Yardbirds’ drummer Jim McCarty not only recalled Jake Holmes supporting the Yardbirds at a New York show in August 1967, but vividly remembers them going to a record shop the next day to buy Holmes’s album, having collectively “decided to do a version … We worked it out together with Jimmy contributing the guitar riffs in the middle.” Holmes, for reasons unknown, took until 2010 to make it a legal matter. And so, as a solution to the suit, when the version from Zeppelin’s one-off 2007 reunion at the O2 Arena was released in 2012, the song was credited to “Page, inspired by Jake Holmes”.</p> \n<h2><strong>6. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ye8KvYKn9-0\"><strong>The James Bond Theme</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"484d408c67e1d6479666b641a09cb19861527aa7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435856963418/9bce8e18-b152-440a-b5b9-9633fdb16a9d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"John Barry was required under oath to explain exactly how he came to compose the James Bond theme.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Barry was required under oath to explain exactly how he came to compose the James Bond theme.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Collection/Rex_Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In 2001, John Barry was finally forced to defend a libel suit brought by Monty Norman after for some years hinting that it was he who had really written the James Bond Theme, not Norman, as it said on every 007 film credit. When openly asked by the Sunday Times in 1998 whether Norman really wrote the theme, Barry was unequivocal: “Absolutely not.” Unfortunately for the newspaper, Barry was required under oath to explain exactly how he came to compose a theme Norman wrote a full five years earlier, under the name <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6EuzGhIyRQ\">Bad Sign, Good Sign</a>. Barry changed tack, begrudgingly admitting he did use the riff from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcILuuZxIag\">Bad Sign, Good Sign</a>, but he still insisted the rest of the tune was his – until an expert witness explained how almost all the theme derived from Norman’s piece. Barry insisted it was all a misunderstanding, and he had never intended to claim royalties on the song. The prosecution promptly produced two letters sent by Barry’s solicitors, threatening to go after Norman for all the royalties unless Norman withdrew his libel action. Barry lost the case, the Times faced a substantial bill for costs, and Norman was awarded &pound;30,000.</p> \n<h2><strong>7. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqfMdChj74Q\"><strong>Mbube</strong></a><strong>/</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09SXTH699xE\"><strong>Wimoweh</strong></a><strong>/</strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LBmUwi6mEo\"><strong>The Lion Sleeps Tonight</strong></a></h2> \n<p>Once upon a time, a Zulu singer called Solomon Linda recorded a traditional Zulu hunting chant, Mbube, for a local South African label run by an Italian immigrant, Eric Gallo, who had originally imported hillbilly records to working-class South Africans. The record was a minor local hit in 1939, the small sum it made going to Gallo, who had purchased the copyright outright from Linda, as was the norm then. One of these records found its way to Pete Seeger, via Alan Lomax. Intrigued by the song, he transcribed it (badly), rearranging it as Wimoweh and generously assigning the copyright to a nom de plume he and his fellow Weavers often used to claim 100% of the publishing on traditional songs (when only 50% was permitted). Gallo, to his credit, was aware enough to realise Wimoweh was Mbube. In exchange for not contesting the “Paul Campbell” credit, he struck a deal with Seeger’s publisher, Howie Richmond, which gave Richmond the US publishing for Wimoweh in exchange for Gallo administering the song in the English-speaking parts of Africa. Wimoweh was covered a few times over the next decade, once by Jimmy Dorsey, but only entered the financial stratosphere in 1961, when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2010/aug/24/george-david-weiss\">George David Weiss</a> rearranged it completely, giving it a new set of words and handing it to doo-wop group the Tokens, calling it The Lion Sleeps Tonight. Only now did Solomon Linda’s snatch of Zulu become a genuine worldwide pop phenomenon, first with the Tokens, then Karl Denver and later Tight Fit. Linda had no copyright claim, but in 2000 the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/mar/03/the-lion-sleeps-tonight-review\">South African journalist Rian Malan took up the case</a> in an article for Rolling Stone – starting a chain that would lead, eventually, to Linda’s descendants reaching a settlement that saw them win the rights to Mbube and secure a share of the revenues from The Lion Sleeps Tonight – which, having featured in Disney’s The Lion King, were huge.</p> \n<h2><strong>8. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kNGnIKUdMI\"><strong>My Sweet Lord</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28eb8f4900329eca1d5f8c9d3c5bd8281b134f5a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/28eb8f4900329eca1d5f8c9d3c5bd8281b134f5a/6_171_3121_1872/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Harrison should have smelled the whiff of mendacity...\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harrison should have smelled the whiff of mendacity...</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sunshine/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Delaney Bramlett claims George Harrison was backstage at a Delaney &amp; Bonnie show in 1969, when “I grabbed my guitar and started playing the Chiffons’s melody from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rinz9Avvq6A\">He’s So Fine</a>, and then sang, ‘My sweet lord, oh my lord, oh my lord.’” Two years later, when he heard Harrison’s My Sweet Lord song on the radio, Bramlett called Harrison up to say he hadn’t meant for him to use the exact melody and to complain about the lack of credit. “But I never saw any money from it.” Nor did George, in the end. In 1971, when Bright Tunes Music – the publisher of He’s So Fine – first filed suit, the Beatles manager Allen Klein met with its president, offering to purchase the near-bankrupt company’s entire catalogue on Harrison’s behalf. He was refused. Harrison then offered the company $148,000, supposedly representing 40% of US royalties on My Sweet Lord. Bright Tunes Music demanded 75% of worldwide receipts and surrender of the song’s copyright. Harrison, having subsequently split with Klein, should have smelled the whiff of mendacity; Klein knowing the future value of this copyright, had bought Bright Tunes Music for himself. It was a clear breach of the fiduciary duty he owed to his former client, and the judge in the case saw it. Rather than the $2m Klein had confidently expected, the judge awarded him $587,000 in damages, the exact sum that he had paid for the company. John Lennon displayed little sympathy for his old friend George, suggesting: “He walked right into it. He knew what he was doing.”</p> \n<h2><strong>9. </strong><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/73327481\"><strong>Blurred Lines</strong></a></h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/mar/10/blurred-lines-pharrell-robin-thicke-copied-marvin-gaye\">March 2015 judgment</a> of an LA court – that Blurred Lines, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams’s megahit, was plagiarised from Marvin Gayes’s 1974 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fp7Q1OAzITM\">Got to Give it Up</a>– sent shockwaves through the industry. Never before had someone – or in this case, their daughter – claimed copyright on a “groove”. Because, as <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/03/if-you-think-robin-thickes-blurred-lines-plagiarises-marvin-gaye-you-dont-understand\">Rhodri Marsden wrote in the New Statesman</a> afterwards, “The view that it plagiarises is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of what songwriting is. Let’s be clear: these two songs are fundamentally different. They have different structures, different melodies, different chords. Were it not for the similarity of the sparse arrangement (an offbeat electric piano figure and a cowbell clanking away at 120bpm), the court case wouldn’t even have taken place.” One suspects there will be another case (Thicke has <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/arts/music/robin-thicke-on-blurred-lines-and-learning-from-his-mistakes.html?ref=media&amp;_r=2\">confirmed he will appeal</a>) and the judgment will be overturned.

What no one in New Order could agree on, though, was where it came from. According to Peter Hook, “We stole it off a Donna Summer B-side” (meaning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uU9ikIg8FU\">Our Love</a>, actually an A-side). Bernard Sumner admitted to further lifts, taking part of the arrangement from Dirty Talk by Klein + MBO, the signature synthesised bassline from Sylvester’s disco classic, You Make Me Feel (Mighty Real), and sampling the long intro from Kraftwerk’s Uranium. Keyboardist Gillian Gilbert didn’t think it ended there: “Peter Hook’s bassline was nicked from an Ennio Morricone film soundtrack.” But if Blue Monday had a starting point, it was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1EgDUTt2iM\">Gerry and the Holograms</a> by a group of the same name, an obscure Mancunian slice of electronica, released on Absurd Records in 1979 – which was actually send-up of music by arch satirist CP Lee, of Albertos Y Los Trios Paranoias, and his friend, John Scott. New Order all knew Lee, but decided the joke was on him.

You’re not an engineer,” says the screen Wozniak. “You’re not a designer. You can’t put a hammer to a nail. I built the circuit board. The graphical interface was stolen. So how come, 10 times in a day, I read Steve Jobs is a genius?

I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me.”</p> \n<p>He added: “The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message, at least partly.

He is looking forward to seeing the final film, which arrives in US cinemas on 9 October and debuts in the UK on 13 November. The personal computer pioneer confirmed he consulted with Sorkin on the project and had dinner with Rogen, though he said he had not asked to see the script.</p> \n<p>“I do not think that would be appropriate,” he said, adding that he felt honoured to be played by a famous actor such as Rogen. “It is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others … Accuracy is second to entertainment in a movie like this.”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435909496906/4d9a3c9b-4493-4330-b9ec-b5a67f7a34dc-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Antonio Olmos/Antonio Olmos","altText":"Steve Wozniak","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Antonio Olmos/Antonio Olmos"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T07:51:06Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T08:01:30Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[{"name":"Ben Child","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/benchild"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Film","Culture","Steve Jobs","Steve Jobs","Technology","Michael Fassbender","Seth Rogen","Danny Boyle","Biopics","Drama","Aaron Sorkin","Apple","Computing"],"tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/steve-jobs","webTitle":"Steve Jobs"},{"id":"technology/stevejobs","webTitle":"Steve Jobs"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"film/michael-fassbender","webTitle":"Michael Fassbender"},{"id":"film/seth-rogen","webTitle":"Seth Rogen"},{"id":"film/danny-boyle","webTitle":"Danny Boyle"},{"id":"film/biopics","webTitle":"Biopics"},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama"},{"id":"culture/aaron-sorkin","webTitle":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"id":"technology/apple","webTitle":"Apple"},{"id":"technology/computing","webTitle":"Computing"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ben Child","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/benchild"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jul/03/steve-wozniak-steve-jobs-trailer-accuracy-second-entertainment-apple","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abkp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/jul/03/steve-wozniak-steve-jobs-trailer-accuracy-second-entertainment-apple","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/03/steve-wozniak-steve-jobs-trailer-accuracy-second-entertainment-apple"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435909496906/4d9a3c9b-4493-4330-b9ec-b5a67f7a34dc-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"“I felt a lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated” ...

I absolutely loved those trips. Byron has changed a lot since then. The population has grown rapidly, which some people have objected to, but it’s still very relaxed. And, of course, the beaches are just as beautiful as ever.</p> \n<p><strong>My dad would take my sisters and I surfing all day at The Pass</strong> – it’s a great beginners’ point-break wave. This kind of wave slowly breaks on one side so the surfer can ride the open face as it runs down the point. The ride is longer and better for a longer-length learner’s board. Even as an advanced surfer, point breaks are my favourite waves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56bc68577d71c128eac5caaf97d96c8dca57f69c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435857622551/63e98407-645d-4109-b7c6-a33289fe0aad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steph Gilmore\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Gilmore</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Women’s presence in surfing is growing rapidly.</strong> I see more and more girls, of all ages, in what were formerly male-dominated line-ups.
