But is she really a fan of 90s indie pinups Suede?</p>","byline":"Imogen Fox","body":"<p>My meeting with Donatella Versace begins with a misunderstanding worthy of a sitcom. I’ve been told by Anthony Vaccarello, creative director of Versus, Versace’s diffusion label, that the new collection launching in Shoreditch tonight is inspired by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/brett-anderson\" title=\"\">Brett Anderson</a> and 1990s Britpop. So, seated next to her on a sofa in a Claridge’s suite, I ask if she is <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/suede\" title=\"\">a fan of Suede</a>. She drags on her e-cigarette and widens her dark-lidded eyes. “Oh, I love it,” she says, sounding as if she is eating something really delicious. “Right,” I say, surprised, but going with it. “What’s your favourite Suede song?” She stops, stares and then laughs – properly laughs – and slaps the sofa. “Oh, the band! I was like, ‘What is she talking about?’” she says, miming an is-she-mad face.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf4bcb76cf4346bf2e81452f4384dc7ca620b34c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536746133/4994a26d-c184-4029-9502-b65f27596f54-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Versus A/W15.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Versus A/W15.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some uptight designers might be embarrassed or annoyed about the mix-up, but not Donatella Versace. For a start, she is used to it. Her staff have told me that she sometimes talks to them in her heavy Milanese accent, knowing full well that they haven’t understood her but are too scared to let on, and this tickles her. Second, for all her dramatic monochrome look, massive jewels and impossibly tiny frame – which has something of the terrier about it – Donatella is real. Funny, honest, a little lawless (in her conversation, at least – she’s been sober for years), with an inability to stop teasing people and making joking asides under her breath. But she doesn’t like Suede. She’s more into commercial pop: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PRw1U8GHbQ\" title=\"\">Rihanna’s Bitch Better Have My Money</a> is a current favourite, as is, predictably, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PRw1U8GHbQ\" title=\"\">Lady Gaga’s Donatella</a>; or else she listens to what she calls her “roots” – a mix of Foo Fighters, Led Zeppelin and Depeche Mode.</p> \n<p>It doesn’t matter that Versace herself isn’t much into the Versus campaign’s inspiration because, although she remains head honcho in the capacity of artistic director for the label, she no longer designs for the line. After a few capsule collections designed by acclaimed British designers <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/interactive/2009/sep/29/versus-versace-christopher-kane-milan\" title=\"\">Christopher Kane</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/may/16/versace-versus-jw-anderson-new-york\" title=\"\">JW Anderson</a>, the task now falls to Vaccarello, a 32-year-old Belgian-Italian designer who has worked with Versus before, but was only <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/2015/01/21/anthony-vacarello-appointed-creative-director-versus\" title=\"\">installed as permanent creative director earlier in the year</a>. Vaccarello came to fashion’s attention by designing model <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/gallery/2012/may/08/met-gala-2012-top-10-dresses\" title=\"\">Anja Rubik’s infamous hipbone dress</a> for the Met Ball in 2012, and his love of the almost-too-sexy makes him an excellent fit for the brand.</p> \n<p>Was it hard for Versace to let go of the label that is often considered her baby? “Yes. But I understand it is the right moment to give it up. I’m not 25, and going out every night. You need to be able to see what is going on, to listen to their language and to go where they are. I cannot do that, even though I would love to. If I do, it’s not going to be radical. Anthony can do that. His sensibility is similar to the DNA of Versace, but he has a fresh eye.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://instagram.com/p/2BWnTlHkik/?taken-by=riccardotisci17\" data-alt=\"Riccardo Tisci Givenchy Versace Instagram\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-captioned=&quot;&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; \n  &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; \n   &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt; \n  &lt;p style=&quot; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&quot;&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/2BWnTlHkik/&quot; style=&quot; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;So proud and honored to introduce my new ultimate icon: Donatella Versace...

In March, the company announced that <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/versace-2014-revenue-and-profit-rise-1427220670\" title=\"\">profits had leapt by 27%</a> in the past 12 months to €26.3 m. A public floatation is regularly said to be imminent. Crucially, the billion-euro brand is seen as outward-looking and engaged in a way that some of its Milanese competitors are not.</p> \n<p>In recent years, Donatella seems to have been actively seeking a role as a weathy patron within the fashion world. Evidence of her modern-day <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/may/08/great-dynasties-medici-family\" title=\"\">de Medici vibes</a> aren’t hard to find. She famously loaned Christopher Kane shoes for his graduate show and later had him on the payroll at Versus (“It was love at first sight with Christopher. He is a special talent with an explosion of ideas”). The “super-talented” JW Anderson has also benefited from some Versus patronage. But, most recently, it was announced that Donatella herself is to star in the upcoming Givenchy campaign. The <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/2BWnTlHkik/?taken-by=riccardotisci17\" title=\"\">announcement was made via Instagram</a> with a picture of Donatella’s platinum profile in front of the face of Givenchy designer Riccardo Tisci. To lend her image and approval to what could be seen as a rival label was an unusual move, suggesting that Donatella is beyond any tawdry fashion cattiness. Tisci, she tells me, sent her an email that began: “I know you will never agree, but&nbsp;...” Donatella couldn’t resist the chance to surprise, and three days later the campaign was shot.</p> \n<p>Versus has put social media at the heart of its new collection’s launch. Unlike most other autumn/winter lines – which were shown back in February and land in the shops months later – these clothes will go on sale immediately. There won’t be a catwalk, merely this launch event. The collection, featuring saucy asymmetrical kilts, heaps of black, and giant silver Versace lion-head buttons, is built to appeal to a younger crowd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1846edf7453cd62f6c70eb62bde75413d954f11\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536836352/0bde0ec7-5084-469f-a1d9-89c599ef72d8-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Versus A/W15.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Versus A/W15.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This instantaneous approach is crucial, according to Donatella. Despite not being on Instagram herself (“I need someone next to me, who understands me immediately, who I can prod to post for me”), the designer understands well that social media has changed fashion. “Before that, we were in a little enclosed circle – fashion designers and fashion journalists. But fashion is not an elite any more: it is a democracy. The real new things are things you see on the street.” In a week where commercial giant <a href=\"http://www.vogue.com/13259351/new-net-a-porter-app-the-net-set/\" title=\"\">Net-a-Porter is launching the Net Set</a> – a shopable social-media platform aimed directly at the consumer-cum-designer – this attitude seems bang on the money.</p> \n<p>Versace’s love affair with London is set to last. The brand will be back to show the next Versus collection on the catwalk at London fashion week in September. So, what is it about the capital that appeals right now? “I find London very exciting: it’s full of subcultures talking together and I love that. It wasn’t like that for a while, but now I feel a lot of energy.” When I ask her why she thinks that might be, her answer is surprising. “I don’t know whether it’s because of the royal family reinterpreting themselves with Prince William. I think that has an influence, I don’t know. When you see Prince Harry, he is one of us.” She motions to a preview video of the Versus collection and laughs, “He could be in that.”</p> \n<p><em>The collection is immediately available at </em><a href=\"http://www.versusversace.com/\" title=\"\"><em>versusversace.com</em></a></p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536606568/a08155e4-2748-42c7-84b5-c37a14cd75af-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Donatella Versace with creative director A Vaccarello.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536745630/4994a26d-c184-4029-9502-b65f27596f54-680x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":680,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Versus A/W15.

But why do we favour other species over our own?</p>","byline":"Dean Burnett","body":"<p>Less than a week after the election, the Conservative party have already announced plans to <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/david-cameron-says-he-wants-to-repeal-the-fox-hunting-ban-10091571.html\">overturn the 2004 ban on fox hunting</a>. This has, inevitably, <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/200000-sign-fox-hunting-petition-5689505\">triggered immediate outrage</a>. You have to wonder at the logic behind this move. For one, considering Cameron’s efforts to detoxify the Conservative party’s image, it’s so incredibly “old-school Tory” as to be laughable, like spending weeks reassuring someone you like that you’re not racist then turning up at your first date in Klan robes. </p> \n<p>Secondly, it seems incredibly unwise. What better way to maintain the surprising goodwill of the people than reintroducing that widely-condemned practice of posh people slaughtering small furry creatures for fun into a society where everyone now has constant access to video cameras and the internet. The Badger cull <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2012/mar/26/badger-cull-bovine-tb-cattle-vaccination\">was bad enough</a>, and that had at least some scientific rationale for it (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2012/mar/20/badger-cull-wales-abandoned-vaccination\">however flawed that was</a>), and it was nominally for agricultural reasons, not entertainment. None of these apply to fox hunting, so people are understandably outraged. </p> \n<p>As many have pointed out, there seems to be far more outrage about some foxes than the welfare cuts that could devastate thousands. Even the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Social_Care_Act_2012#Public_reactions\">“save the NHS” petitions</a> didn’t get this level of interest. Yes, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/brain-flapping/2015/apr/29/outrage-public-widespread-anger-is-so-common-psychology\">people are easily outraged</a>, but this excessive. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-705dfa9c-f2dd-47a3-9903-84973bb87f17\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431528664595/16a2269c-de07-4d26-bee7-0e4d9c707138-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A fox in suburbia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Can’t really blame foxes for taking refuge in the cities if hunting is coming back.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Dyson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Similarly, and more worryingly, a million strong petition has compelled the European parliament to consider <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/may/09/animal-research-vivisection-ban-eu-parliament-debate\">a ban on all animal research</a>. This would have devastating consequences for thousands, even millions of sick people, given how <a href=\"https://www.bhf.org.uk/about-us/our-policies/research-policies/animals-in-research\">integral animal experimentation is to successful medical research</a>. </p> \n<p>Whatever your opinions on these issues, the above examples show clear examples of animals being prioritised over humans. This is actually nothing new, especially in the UK. The <a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.uk/utilities/aboutus/history\">RSPCA</a> was established SIXTY YEARS <a href=\"http://www.nspcc.org.uk/about-us/\">before the NSPCC</a>. The first recognition of child cruelty as a crime was actually <a href=\"http://www.bushywood.com/bunny_boilers/NSPCC_national_society_for_prevention_of_cruelty_to_children.htm\">due to the RSPCA</a>, where a child was defined as “a small animal” because no child protection laws existed. The UK also has some of the most comprehensive and rigorous <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1986/14/contents\">animal testing laws</a> you’re likely to find anywhere. It doesn’t forbid it outright though, which makes it still unacceptable for many. </p> \n<p>But where does this prioritising of animals over our own species come from? It’s a uniquely human feature. You don’t get hippos taking on lions to defend the zebras, or seagulls dive-bombing cats to protect their ratty comrades. </p> \n<p>Empathy is clearly a factor. The ability/capacity to appreciate and understand what another person is experiencing, “putting yourself in someone else’s shoes”, is undoubtedly crucial in grasping and reacting to the suffering of others. The human brain is surprisingly good at doing this, reading the cues of another person and assessing how they’re feeling, but it does have something of an egocentric bias; the emotions you’re experiencing at any given time are invariably projected onto the other person you’re assessing. There’s a region of the brain, the right supramarginal gyrus, which is seemingly dedicated to <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/39/15466.abstract\">detecting and overcoming this egocentric bias.</a> </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb4cd608f233e0e22d9c003479b6e8606a0ce0f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431528993150/9c45fe2f-fba7-4f0d-a1d6-aac12ddf9f56-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Brown rat on South Georgia\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rats don’t get hunted. Rats don’t need protecting. Rats can handle themselves.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paula O'Sullivan/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>However, studies have shown that it’s <a href=\"http://www.mpg.de/7560736/supramarginal-gyrus-empathy\">much harder to empathise correctly when your own state is very different to someone else’s</a>, suggesting there are limits to this compensatory mechanism. Two people experiencing something unpleasant will be very good at empathising correctly, but if one is experiencing pleasure while the other is suffering, then the pleasure experiencing person will seriously underestimate this suffering. So the more privileged and comfortable someone’s life is, the harder it is for them to appreciate the needs and issues of the worse off. But as long as we don’t put the most pampered sorts in charge of running the country or anything, we should be OK.</p> \n<p>Animals seem to short-circuit this system somewhat. People have a strong tendency to empathise with animals, some of it is undoubtedly cultural but there’s an established tendency to favour or respond positively and emotionally <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/brain-flapping/2013/sep/13/ugly-animals-preservation-cute-creepy\">to anything “cute”</a>, hence the focus on foxes, or images of puppies or kittens being used by animal rights protestors, rather than <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drosophila\">fruit flies</a>. This may be an <a href=\"http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ufaw/aw/2010/00000019/a00102s1/art00014\">evolved tendency</a>, and some suggest we favour anything that has the qualities of human children (small, cute, vulnerable, playful, big eyes etc.) Although, with the earlier RSPCA/NSPCC revelation, this suggests we prefer child-like things to actual children. </p> \n<p>There’s also the <a href=\"http://www.scu.edu/ethics/publications/iie/v3n2/justworld.html\">“Just World” hypothesis</a>, a persistent bias people have to believe the world is intrinsically fair, despite it being largely random. This belief can be quite integral to a person’s worldview, and they’ll work hard to preserve it. As a result, we <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/brain-flapping/2013/jan/15/julie-burchill-transphobia-hostility-victims-oppression\">get victim blaming</a>. Someone is suffering? Well it’s a fair world, and that wouldn’t happen in a fair world unless they did something to deserve it. </p> \n<p>There’s also evidence of subconscious defence mechanisms, especially if someone encounters a victim a lot like them. Seeing a victim you can relate to means whatever happened to them could happen to you, which is a scary thought. The brain gets round this by concluding that the victim must have screwed up at some point, not that bad things can happen to anyone (you). And thus, we diminish the suffering of others to preserve our own piece of mind. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5c51c28329e02aaacb18254c4495f61392b17e0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431529231743/f7a2a4c8-3f40-4690-a24e-bd15790c2a3c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Royal Ball Python\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some animals inspire feelings of concern and affection in humans.

But an animal, no matter what the circumstance, is always “innocent”, as they simply lack the ability to do anything to deserve suffering at the hands of man. Even the most vicious dog attacking a human is doing it because it feels it has to, not because it enjoys violence or cruelty. And thus, the suffering of animals <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/ethics-and-morality\">violates our moral boundaries</a> more easily than that of humans. </p> \n<p> It comes down to how we are predisposed to often assume guilt or compliance in our fellow humans, but animals are always innocent. </p> \n<p>Except wasps.

Something went very wrong, not just in the polling booths or in the tight little team that surrounded Ed Miliband or in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/08/polls-wrong-pre-election-results\" title=\"\">predictions of the now entirely preposterous pollsters</a> (landlines?), but in the hivemind of the&nbsp;left, or the leftovers, or whatever we call ourselves. And this thing was the inability to imagine difference.</p> \n<p>Much posturing occurs in bourgeois circles about respecting difference, alongside talk of the value of empathy. Empathy is the all-purpose salve. So where has this been extended to people who voted “the wrong way”? “Who are these people, and when will they be put to death?” appears to have been the initial reaction to the election. The second was: “Christ, we may need some of them back on board.” And the third was the word “aspiration”, repeated as if it were a&nbsp;satanic chant. Gaunt Blairites ventured out in daylight again in a deluded attempt to turn back&nbsp;time.</p> \n<p>Grief is a complex emotion all right. No one can call time on someone else’s reaction by cheerily saying, “Don’t mourn, organise” when it is no longer clear what the organising principles are. One of these, I suggest, might be not to hate people who are slightly different from you. It may, indeed, be possible to leave London and venture only to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/shortcuts/2015/may/12/britains-latest-breakaway-nation-peoples-republic-brighton-hove\" title=\"\">People’s Republic of Brighton and Hove</a> or fly to Scotland and simply avoid the rest of the country in order to maintain one’s illusions of purity. The US, after all, has those awkward bits that so many fly over from east coast to west coast, full of white trash, rednecks and Republicans. Is that where we are heading?</p> \n<p>The utter lack of comprehension about why people vote Tory, or indeed don’t vote at all, has been galling. <em>Mea culpa</em> – I indulge in my share of&nbsp;Tory-bashing, but I keep it to politicians not civilians. As I grew up in a working-class Tory-voting household, the idea that everyone good just “is” Labour is anathema. I was arguing with&nbsp;my mum about this until the day she died. We always thought each other wrong and moved on to more pressing subjects. Years of screaming at her over the turkey that she herself was a turkey voting for Christmas did not change her voting habits. She just went out for a fag and moaned to the neighbours that I was “still against everything”.</p> \n<p>Of course, I had diagnosed her with that everyday ailment “false consiousness”. This is still how most of the left operates. We have the truth, we know what is best and we will enlighten you, awaken you from your slumbers and you will be grateful.</p> \n<p>That people may then say, “Actually, I am all right as I am – go away” is hardly suprising. But it is this view of a passive electorate that has to be activated by some higher power that is itself a problem. The Labour party’s top-down structure is unappealing. Much of its internal process is incomprehensible. Its language waivers between jargon and meaninglessness. Alarm bells rang in my head a few weeks ago when a care worker asked me what austerity meant. She understood the concept, obviously; it was just not a word she&nbsp;used.</p> \n<p>Something has gone very wrong when in the very places where austerity is much more than a&nbsp;concept, people have turned away from Labour. There are those who will valiantly try to rebuild the party. It may not be possible. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jan/27/uk-austerity-greece-parallels-labour-toxic-eliteness\" title=\"\">Look at Pasok in Greece</a> to see how parties of the left can fossilise.</p> \n<p>The insistence that we return to Blairism is depressing and a sign of denial about what Blairism was a response to: Thatcherism, with its core values about the supremacy of the market cloaked in the language of individual choice. The&nbsp;unleashing of the market has continued to undermine the postwar settlement, a way of organising society in which people identified themselves by class. Technology has further ruptured this class identification as people cluster in networks and not hierarchies.</p> \n<p>If anyone wants to listen to the so-called “shy&nbsp;Tories”, what you will often hear is not talk&nbsp;of aspiration but a desire to be left alone by&nbsp;the state – even a deep suspicion of it. This contradiction for anyone on the left has long been&nbsp;apparent. Imagining that all good reform comes from the state and everything bad from outside just does not correspond to people’s lived&nbsp;experience.</p> \n<p>Class solidarity cannot be imposed from the outside. As core Labour votes go to Ukip or the SNP, the metropolitan left tells us consistently that nationalism is not a concept worth organising around, but then has a kind of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/syriza\" title=\"\">Syriza</a>-in-Surrey fantasy.</p> \n<p>I am not so sure. And I am only a bit English, but again I think of my flag-waving mother, who nursed my “uncle” when he had Aids, who was half of a mixed-race couple when that was much frowned upon. She believed that the Tories would enable her to do things and that Labour would stop her doing them. I called her stupid many times when I was a teenager. I had to get over myself. Now we all have to get over ourselves.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431541227893/The-left-thinks-it-knows--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The left thinks it knows what is best and will enlighten people, and they will be grateful.

Loutish, low-rent, taste-free, commercial … There are no end of insults, some justified, some pure snobbery, that supposed connoisseurs of food and drink like to throw its way. You might assume that in craft beer circles, all lager is shunned, but not so. Craft geeks want to see all beer styles brewed properly for maximum flavour, and newer UK brewers, such as Camden Town and Brewdog, happily brew lagers (Hells and This is Lager, respectively). </p> \n<p>Around 75% of the beer sold in Britain is mainstream lager. Most commercial lager is churned out quickly, often bulked out with cheap adjuncts such as rice and corn. Craft lagers use an all-malt base, and should be loaded with hops and matured for at least a month, if not much longer. This mimics the production methods of the better Czech and German lagers. Budvar, for instance, is still cold-fermented, or “lagered”, for 90 days. </p> \n<p>Indeed, if you want to put a bit of pizzazz into your pub pilsner, opting for a Czech classic such as Pilsner Urquell or German imports such as Jever or Veltins is a sensible way to start. But with summer and BBQ season fast approaching, what are your options in the supermarket – which lagers are not just cold and crisp but crafted with real character?

It is so flavour-packed, in fact, that it may be too much for some lager drinkers. </p> \n<p><strong>9/10</strong></p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=282059793\"><strong>Tesco, Revisionist Craft Lager</strong></a><br /><a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/groceries/Product/Details/?id=282059793\"><em>500ml, 5%, &pound;1.89</em></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cf835999d81d706ac5857b6c36f7a050d12c06e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431524491958/9328da1d-653b-43f1-9704-02070748d6ca-266x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Revisionist craft\" width=\"266\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Brewed for Tesco by Marston’s, this “hybrid lager” uses six hop varieties, and yet, despite that apparent surfeit of ingredients, this thin, fizzy drop tastes of very little.

The artist, perhaps working from original designs by the great Pheidias, seems capable of expressing the motion of water, even of air, in hard stone. The musculature of Ilissos, the river god who once adorned the Parthenon’s west pediment, strains and relaxes as he heaves himself on to his riverbank, his penis resting on his thigh. These sculptures are utterly desirable objects. Their beauty is godlike.<br /></p> \n<p>These are more than masterpieces, though: the status of these particular sculptures surpasses that of all the other great objects from the classical Greek world that are scattered in museum collections across the globe. They have become symbolic of Greek nationhood, identity and history, a freighting so heavy that it sometimes seems to threaten to crush the delicate carving of the objects themselves. And, since the Greek actor and politician Melina Mercouri ignited the issue in the 1980s, the Greek political desire to restore the sculptures to Athens has been unwavering.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"089fb997ab008f169935723eb3f0ac9cc3facb8f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431528972992/c434f7cb-f9d8-4e60-9180-02a17276da2d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Parthenon gallery at the British Museum\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Parthenon sculptures gallery at the British Museum is the usual setting for the ancient masterpieces.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Stainforth/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, a new chapter in the struggle for restitution has opened: yesterday Nikos Xydakis, the Greek culture minister, ruled out pursuing restitution through the international courts, despite the previous government’s hiring of a high-profile legal team from London’s Doughty Street Chambers – QCs including Geoffrey Robertson and Norman Palmer, and Amal Clooney.</p> \n<p>“The road to reclaiming the return of the sculptures is diplomatic and political,” Xydakis said on Greece’s Mega TV . “You can’t go to trial on every issue, and in international courts the outcome is uncertain, things are not so easy.”</p> \n<p>He was speaking 48 hours after his government had received a 148-page dossier from Robertson’s team describing a “now or never” opportunity for Greece and advising it to take the British Museum to the International Court of Justice. However, the argument over the rightful ownership of the sculptures will not simply vanish: the war of the marbles will continue by other means. “Low-key persistent work” was what was needed, according to Xydakis. “The road to reclaiming the return of the sculptures is diplomatic and political.”</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>This spring the trustees of the British Museum knocked back a proposal by the Greek government that a mediation process, run by Unesco, be embarked upon to decide the future of those of the Parthenon sculptures that are held by the British Museum.<br /></p> \n<p>In a letter to Unesco, dated 26 March 2015, the trustees declared that the case of the Elgin marbles did not fall within the scope of the United Nations’ cultural organisation’s role as safeguarder of endangered cultural heritage and thus they “decided respectfully to decline this request”.</p> \n<p>The enormous emotional significance and national symbolism attached to the sculptures is of relatively recent date – and certainly would have been alien to the Athenians who built the great temple to their goddess atop the ashes of its predecessor, burned by an Persian invading army in 480BC.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/mar/20/naked-ambition-why-the-greeks-first-stripped-nude\">Naked ambition: when the Greeks first stripped off</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Greeks of the 5th century BC were not united by statehood or geographical unity; they were a people scattered across islands and shorelines from Asia Minor to the Black Sea to Marseille, a collection of quarrelsome, independent, politically heterogeneous city-states united by language, custom, religion, and, briefly and partially, by enmity to the aggressive Persian empire to their east. The sculptures have accrued layers of meaning over time – layers that it is now impossible, even if it were desirable, to scrape away.</p> \n<p>In Athens, the argument seems obvious: bring them home to the Acropolis Museum, where about a third of the Parthenon sculptures already reside, and allow them fully to tell the story of that astonishing temple, built by a war-ravaged, victorious city state.</p> \n<p>Lord Elgin, it is argued, who was British ambassador to the Ottoman court in Istanbul in the early 19th century, acquired the sculptures through an agreement of dubious legitimacy; and now that a beautiful new museum has been built to showcase the history of the Acropolis, the case for bringing them home is unarguable.</p> \n<p>In London, the trustees of the British Museum argue that the sculptures were legally acquired and that they play a public role, in the context of a universal museum, in telling a story about global history and culture – one that they can tell only by being seen in the context of artefacts from other continents and other times.</p> \n<p>They also point out that while the British Museum holds about a third of the surviving Parthenon sculptures, a third are on display in the Acropolis Museum and another third scattered about Europe from the Louvre to the Munich Glyptothek.</p> \n<p>Today’s urgent challenge, according to the British Museum, is to allow the sculptures to be discovered and appreciated not just in Greece and Great Britain but around the world: hence the loan, last year, of Ilissos the river god to the Hermitage in St Petersburg.</p> \n<p>The arguments are finely balanced. The war of the marbles shows every sign of rumbling forward, insolubly, into the future.</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431529261940/37d759c7-9fbb-4ed1-8410-1c614f1c4755-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dylan Martinez/Reuters","altText":"Parthenon marbles at the British Museum","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431528974350/c434f7cb-f9d8-4e60-9180-02a17276da2d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Parthenon sculptures gallery at the British Museum is the usual setting for the ancient masterpieces.
