Nor, amusingly, do they prevent Strauss offering Pietersen a role as an adviser on one-day cricket.</p> \n<p>One thing is clear: the concept “Kevin Pietersen” is the black hole of English cricket, from whose event horizon there is no escape. Indeed, it bends simplistic laws of time and space by swallowing even things that theoretically predate it. I am literally incapable of hearing the title of Lionel Shriver’s most famous novel – published a full two years before Pietersen had even made his international debut – without thinking of radio phone-ins about Kevin Pietersen.</p> \n<p>I used to think that had to change eventually. I used to think that at some point in the future, I would be able to catch sight of that book’s spine on my shelf and not reflexively hear two generic men shouting at each other. “He’s the best we have!” “He’s not worth it!” When oh when could I return to the halcyon days of innocence when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLRgAe2jLaw\" title=\"\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a> just made me think of a teenage sociopath using a crossbow to commit mass murder?</p> \n<p>Without getting bogged down in relativity, I now realise that happy place is perpetually beyond my reach. The last time this debate reared its head, when the much-lauded incoming ECB chairman, Colin Graves, suggested there may be a route back for Kevin, I see <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/mar/04/kevin-pietersen-thatcher-england-batsman-return\" title=\"\">I remarked that none of us should rule out the argument being the last thing we heard before we died</a>, even if that expected departure date was decades away. Clearly, events have rendered that projection hopelessly optimistic.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0a98f7e90386dd86c88f0c42e8f184f1df42f0de\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431510583666/af445bf8-39d8-4fb8-a1b8-cca5062d15f3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The concept 'Kevin Pietersen' is the black hole of English cricket, from whose event horizon there is no escape.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The concept ‘Kevin Pietersen’ is the black hole of English cricket, from whose event horizon there is no escape.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rowe/David Rowe/Demotix/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The debate about whether there is a way back for Pietersen is likely to be the last thing my grandchildren will hear before they die, in their beds, peacefully, at the age of 136. Megalomania has often given a fillip to science, and I am given to understand that cryonic advances today are basically being driven by the Kevin Pietersen Society’s desire to restore him to this rightful place in the England batting order. There is no point in criticising the brilliant minds now involved in the questionable technical enterprise. As the physicist and inventor Leo Szilard once remarked: “This is not the tragedy of the scientist; it is the tragedy of mankind.”</p> \n<p>Then again, perhaps the cosmic size of the Pietersen problem requires us to think cosmically about it. Only a few weeks ago, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2015/apr/27/stephen-hawking-tells-fans-zayn-malik-could-still-be-in-a-parallel-one-direction\" title=\"\">Stephen Hawking</a> was asked about the universe-shattering event that was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2015/apr/07/zayn-malik-muslim-pop-star\" title=\"\">Zayn Malik</a>’s departure from One Direction, and he answered the question with relish. “My advice to any heartbroken young girl is to pay close attention to the study of theoretical physics,” he said, “because one day there might be proof of multiple universes. It would not be beyond the realms of possibility that somewhere outside of our own universe lies a different universe – and in that universe, Zayn is still in One Direction.” Indeed, that notional heartbroken girl may care to know that in a further possible universe, “she and Zayn are happily married”.</p> \n<p>Is there not something there for bereft Pietersen fans – and indeed those who wish he had stayed South African? Many appear to have already relocated to the universe where his current Test average is something other than 47 – they must now be buoyed by the possibility that, somewhere, he is chalking up triple centuries every innings. Or, at the very least, in for all eternity at The Oval, having notched up 648 at time of going to press.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in this alternative universe, Strauss is now the MP for Kensington and Chelsea, having been elected with the traditional eye-watering majority last Friday. After all, it was only three months ago that Strauss – a Celebrity Conservative – was being linked with the seat, following the resignation of Malcolm Rifkind. (He’d also been touted when Corby became vacant back in 2012.) As Hawking says, you may care to pay close attention to the study of theoretical physics and accept that, somewhere, Strauss is on the fast track to being an inevitably inadequate minister of something or other by 2020, while Michael Vaughan’s first act as director of cricket has been to recall Pietersen.</p> \n<p>Not keen on that one? Then the universe – certainly one of the alternative universes – will provide. Inconceivable though it may seem, we must not discount the possibility of a universe where English cricket is not just going to be run a different shade of idiotically, as indicated by the apparent wild goose chase upon which Graves dispatched Pietersen as almost his first act within the job. And if even that doesn’t offer comfort, I can only leave you with my own preference: that the untried Malik is brought in at No4 for the Ashes, during which he averages 105.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431510357680/Andrew-Strauss-left-and-K-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"When there was trust: Kevin Pietersen, right, and his then England captain Andrew Strauss in happier Ashes-winning times.

Or rather it’s not, and therein lies the problem. <a href=\"http://www.nudevotion.com/\">Nudevotion</a>, a click-through shopping aggregator, has cottoned on to this. Matching shoppers to their definition of nude, it offers a far wider palette of nude-appropiate clothes, shoes and makeup. Ideal if you’re not white.</p> \n<p>The debate surrounding the word “nude” in fashion can be dated back to November 2009 when Michelle Obama wore a “nude” dress by Naeem Khan. The designer described it as “sterling-silver sequin, abstract floral, nude strapless gown”, leading Jezebel to quip, Nude for whom?, suggesting that there was no debate since, well, the nude in question (a sort of champagne pink) was only nude if you were a specific skin colour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"127a63b7d6f1e3f7d1666bab856066cb2620be7a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431526683081/372dfb90-fcbd-47ba-945b-0165a860d8e3-263x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Michelle Obama in the 'nude' dress\" width=\"263\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michelle Obama in the ‘nude’ dress</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This proved especially problematic since nude went on to become one of the most prolific trends of the past five years. Christian Louboutin’s “nude” heels became a staple on the red carpet. Stuart Weitzman named his the “nudist”. Since then, the word has been slowly and correctly phased out. Mostly. Pantone still has a <a href=\"http://www.pantone.com/pages/pantone/colorfinder.aspx\">“nude” tone</a> in its colour palette, and one of the definitions on Dictionary.com is, vaguely and semi-diplomatically, “a light grayish-yellow brown to brownish-pink colour”. In 2013, Louboutin launched multiples<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/fashion-blog/2013/oct/14/christian-louboutin-nude-shoes-non-white-skin\"> shades</a> of “nude” shoes. But still, in wider circles, the word stuck.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"48fe0d9e8c740746b8de07a8ebd168e17aea4974\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431516273965/aa5f7624-3833-47c1-88af-88c75f6ed4d8-460x229.jpeg\" alt=\"The nudes collection by Christian Louboutin\" width=\"460\" height=\"229\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The nudes collection by Christian Louboutin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louboutin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nudevotion works thus: shoppers click on one of the two shades and up pops the pieces available. Two shades isn’t much, but it is progress. Plus, when technology catches up, they plan to launch more. To someone who is traditionally seen as white, the pieces cover all of my possible skin tones: flushed, sunburned, creamy, tired and jaundiced. But what about non-white customers? With that in mind, two writers of varying skin tones tried it out.</p> \n<h2>“I am not sure the word nude really means anything”<br />Lynette Nylander, managing editor of i-D</h2> \n<p>“I would say I am a tad warmer in skin tone than <a href=\"http://rgb.to/pantone/4635-u\">Pantone swatch 4635U</a>. The (acute) meaning and representation of the word nude in fashion is something that has affected my clothing choices since a young age. It’s sad that the industry hasn’t quite picked up that one taupe bra does not fit all. For this reason, I don’t really comprehend the word ‘nude’ in the way I would think fashion would expect me to. Shopping via a skin-coloured swatch feels quite alien but perhaps because this isn’t something I have seen outside of online makeup e-commerce. The skin swatches are indeed very limited and something Nudevotion definitely need to look into widening in the future. And the fact that it acts as a middle man between you and the purposefully picked ‘nude’ items makes it seem a little impersonal. And why nude? To me, it opens the floor to sites solely dedicated to stores retailing products of only one colour. ‘Rally round red’ perhaps? or ‘Be all blue’? Really, I am not sure the word nude really means anything as it isn’t nude for anyone.”</p> \n<h2>“The darker skin tone resulted in only three items”<br />Sara Ilyas, Guardian fashion</h2> \n<p>“I would describe my skin colour as light brown of Pakistani heritage. Alongside ‘ethnic’, ‘nude’ is one of fashion’s most infuriatingly lazy terms. Who’s nude are we talking about here? Run a quick <a href=\"http://www.polyvore.com/cgi/shop?\">search</a> for ‘nude’ clothes and it’s <a href=\"http://query=nude+shoe&amp;.search_src=masthead_search\">clear</a>: nude is not brown. Sure, Christian Louboutin designed a range of ‘nude’ shoes for all skin tones, but some of us don’t have &pound;500. Brands such as <a href=\"https://www.nubianskin.com/\">Nubian Skin</a> that specialise in underwear for black skin are much more affordable. Clicking through Nudedevotion, I’m not sure if it will make much of a difference. Clicking the ‘colour tab’ for the darker skin tone resulted in only three items, though there are more items if you browse manually. Aggregators can be messy and flustering to look at – a shop that specialises in basics in all manner of ‘nude’ shades, ie a neutral American Apparel, would be far more useful. Plus, keep up. Language evolves. Nude went from meaning a naked figure in western art to a lazy colour description for patent court shoes, and in 2015 it means a naked picture of yourself. Nude is not a colour.”</p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431515871366/e0abfdd5-fff4-4600-9b33-df98a79f5bef-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Sandals, dress and bag","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431526684062/372dfb90-fcbd-47ba-945b-0165a860d8e3-1279x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1279,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Michelle Obama in the ‘nude’ dress Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images","credit":"Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images","altText":"Michelle Obama in the 'nude' dress","cleanCaption":"Michelle Obama in the ‘nude’ dress","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Brendan Smialowski/Getty Images"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431516274554/aa5f7624-3833-47c1-88af-88c75f6ed4d8-620x309.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":309,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The nudes collection by Christian Louboutin.

The winner: a<a href=\"http://www.steenbergs.co.uk/blog/2015/04/40-years-on-the-shelf-the-winner-of-our-oldestspice-competition-was-pickling-spice-from-1975/\"> pot of Sainsbury’s pickling spices bought in 1975 for 19p</a>. Clearly we should celebrate such Olympic standard procrastination. I’m sure they were planning to get round to their brilliant home-pickling project, just as soon as they had rearranged the cutlery drawer. But for me that response was overlaid by something else: recognition.</p> \n<p>For, purely by coincidence, while Steenbergs was encouraging the nation to excavate their kitchen cabinets, we were also giving our own walk-in larder a clean out. I say “we”. It was entirely my wife’s doing. I was minded to let sleeping condiments lie. Two of my unbending rules for a happy life: never look under a teenager’s bed and never, ever mess with the kitchen cupboards.</p> \n<p>But she was determined. And so the great work began. I stood by and watched as the kitchen surfaces were quickly covered with a Manhattan of bottles and jars of ancient vintage. This brought me face to face with all my unrealised ambitions as a domestic cook. My desire to be an endlessly inventive kitchen warrior with a seemingly boundless repertoire, piled up unceremoniously before me.</p> \n<p>There were the jars of buttercup-yellow preserved lemons, and the dinky pots of harissa paste, the colour of coagulating blood, from the period when I was determined to explore the wilder shores of the Levantine culinary tradition. There were things called “marmalade” which didn’t involve oranges, and pitch-black pastes made from damsons which I seem to recall needing for my home experiments in neo-rustic British nose-to-tail eating. And don’t get me started on the Asian stuff: the fermented bean pastes with endless permutations of chilli and dried shrimp; the misos of ever darkening shades; the rice wines and soys and vinegars.</p> \n<p>Some of these had been opened. I peered inside to find a few with a deep dimple where I had sampled this new genius purchase, and then realised I didn’t have a clue what to do with it. Others had developed furry moulds so thick I didn’t know whether to scoop them out or stroke them and get them baptised. And then there were those – oh the shame – where the seal hadn’t even broken.</p> \n<p>I should beat myself up here over the disgusting waste, and I do. It doesn’t matter how long it takes to throw something away: waste is still waste. But even more than that I mourn all those dishes that could have been. They were not undermined by lack of ingredients. I reckon I had even accumulated the makings for a couple of Yotam Ottolenghi’s simpler recipes.

The lead character of Witcher 3 first appeared in the fantasy novels of Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. But his true home is in video games.</p> \n<p>As a Witcher, he has many talents, which make him the perfect, pliable protagonist. Geralt is a fine swordsman, able to control both crowds of jabbing bandits and the hulking beasts that he pursues across the countryside for rich bounties. He is an accomplished rider, able to drive a stallion through forests and across shallow rivers – even, sometimes, in formal races on the manicured track – at speed. It’s a necessary skill here in Temeria, which stretches farther than most video game lands, from the fields of Velen, with their stoic windmills and muddles of sunflowers, to the craggy, froth-lapped rocks of the Skellige islands and beyond.</p> \n<p>He is a skilled and charming negotiator, always ready with a witty retort, or a shrewd observation (you pick the response) and, when an interviewee proves contrarily aggressive or guarded, Geralt is able to issue a Jedi-like wave of the hand to calm their blood or loosen their tongue. His talent for detective work would make Sherlock Holmes hot with envy. Geralt is able to read a murder scene of which there are a great many even for a medieval-esque fantasy game, intuiting clues where others see none. As he prods at the bloodied carpet and the broken mirror, he’ll murmur a recreation of the deadly event like one of the grizzled Baltimore detectives from The Wire. Outside, he can track the daintiest paw through terrain that would prove unreadable to others. He is a skilled alchemist who can mix a potion from almost any combination of plants, and his resourcefulness in turning an animal’s carcass into a life-giving morsel is unparalleled (press “Up” to pop a life-giving steak or a rejuvenating beer at any point mid-battle).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0389ec06206e1c457f8577acdf720b4188c1e7f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431449684241/ee7a0830-efd1-4892-9f8e-50c68b989a6f-460x276.png\" alt=\"Witcher 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Naturally, you make firm friends in every village you visit.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bandai Namco</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>These considerable attributes combine with his battle-worn good looks to make Geralt something of a triumph with women – although, at his age, he must now also pay the unavoidable taxes on debauchery: loneliness and longing (for much of the game he pursues lost loves both romantic and familial). While we have known this much about Geralt for some time, in this, the third game from Polish developer CD Projekt RED, these abilities are given a freer rein than ever before. The linear, on-rails approach of the preceding Witcher titles is gone, making way for an open, Grand Theft Auto-style adventure, in which you are permitted, to a certain degree, to pursue goals of your own choosing. Geralt has a Swiss army knife of interactive tools, and his set of abilities offer a uniquely varied and diverse journey. Indeed, his skills come to define the world in which he operates. For once, not every virtual problem must be solved with virtual violence.</p> \n<p>Neither do all of the game’s wonderful host of characters (voiced by a notable cast that includes Game of Thrones’ Charles Dance) exist purely for Geralt’s benefit – a design decision that tempers what might otherwise have been a tiresome power fantasy. The world is full of history, nuance and – glory hallelujah! – plausible writing. As you tour Temeria (one part Scottish highlands, one part Idaho plains), following your primary quest objectives, you happen upon scores of alluring offshoot stories. Many of these enticing distractions are advertised on town notice boards. You may be asked to retrieve an elderly lady’s saucepan from the locked house of its borrower. You could choose to take up the plight of a master swordsmith who, after the local gangsters squeezed his trade routes, has been forced to sell dumplings instead. The people you meet and the stories they tell feel authentic and meaningful, in a way that so few video games in this style truly manage.</p> \n<p>In one convoluted quest midway through the game, which lasts numerous hours, you become involved in the plight of a family that has been brought to ruin by infidelity, domestic abuse and miscarriage. It’s a perilous topic for any video game to approach, especially one in which the player has the kind of agency that can be communicated via the dumbing force of a blade. But the scriptwriters succeed in building an affecting and authentic scenario in which you are not merely a spectator, but active participant. </p> \n<p>But there are problems too. Battles have neither heft nor grace and, often, the game groans under the weight of its technological ambition (its world is, supposedly, twenty per cent larger than rival, Skyrim). Textures pop in and the frame-rate drops agonisingly. One intermittent bug sends your horse flying into the air. Dismount while hovering, and you can fall to your death. These shortfalls may be addressed post-release (and the game, arguably, is no less stable than the bug-rich world of launch-era Skyrim), but for now they slightly dampen its brilliance, even if they cannot quite spoil the sheen of its unrivalled cinematic storytelling.</p> \n<p>On that subject, the narrative interludes that frame your journey are not flimsy excuses to send you on a time-wasting trek, but rather infuse the action with weight and consequence. Often there is no clear ‘right’ answer to a conversation thread and often, regardless of your choices, the losses are substantial. Occasionally, a key character will die through a mistake you make, or an act of negligence, and you will no longer be able to complete a certain mission. You must come to terms with the loss and, as in the real world, own the event as part of your own story. Indeed, the way in which the developers manage to wrangle the various, divergent threads of your unique journey, with all of its composite choices and outcomes, while entirely concealing the seams is masterly.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c099a45abf3eb28b6a9317f072a51a6eb3d1615\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431449886331/832d1b81-09e3-44db-8f2f-b10111d86cbd-460x276.png\" alt=\"Witcher 3\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The scarred landscape often tells its own tales of war and death, leading to intriguing side-quests.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bandai Namco</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Elsewhere, the game’s building blocks are sound but familiar. You are able to develop Geralt into your preferred cipher (predominantly warrior, alchemist or mage) through upgrades. You can build him weapons and armour from the detritus you scavenge. Many missions can be completed in more than one way. Importantly, this is a cohesive, coherent world. Shopkeepers have a limited budget (which is made visible), so may not be able to buy all of your loose tat from you. Every candle and lamp you find in a house can be lit with a burst of your flame magic – it’s pointless, but it is also logical.</p> \n<p>The world, in other words, nobly upholds its rules. This much is expected of every open world game in what is now, undeniably, the medium’s most competitive genre. What is also expected is a technical proficiency that the game is unable to deliver with consistence. Less expected, perhaps, is the fact that most players will turn a blind eye to these shortcomings. While Geralt may live in video games, he was born in literature and, as such, carries literature’s essential appeal. We simply must know what happens next.</p> \n<p><strong>Banda Namco/CD Projekt Red; PC/Xbox One/PlayStation 4 (version tested); &pound;45; Pegi rating: 18+</strong><br /></p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431520130189/8bfad8ae-5a24-4617-988e-ccafee83324f-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AP","altText":"Witcher 3","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431449685079/3820d973-b176-4461-8445-bea76994820d-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Naturally, you make firm friends in every village you visit.

But I just can’t bring myself to lie. Apart from a very brief break at about the age of seven, when I discovered what went into the “lurid pink paste sold in plastic tubs”, as Belinda Harley puts it in her book Roast Lamb in the Olive Groves, I’ve been a lifelong devotee of the pungently savoury, vaguely fishy pink stuff. Fancy deli or corner shop, served with toasted pitta or Pringles, I love it all.</p> \n<p>But there is room in my heart for the more authentic kind too, the sort you might actually eat in Greece – which is harder to come by in this country.

You can buy dried, salted mullet roe, usually sold under its Italian name bottarga if you look a bit harder. I don’t have much luck with tarama, and bottarge is a ruinously expensive thing to buy just to rehydrate.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/aug/11/how-to-make-perfect-hummus\">How to make perfect hummus</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, Harley allows the substitution of smoked roe – as <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/recipes/homemade-taramasalata-with-boiled-eggs-and-black-olives-663641.html\">Lindsey Bareham and Simon Hopkinson observe in the Prawn Cocktail Years</a>, it is often all that is available in the UK. Any fishmonger who stocks fish from sustainable sources ought to be able to get you some if they don’t already have it in stock. It needn’t be cod; Nick Fisher and Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall reckon you can make it with pollack or ling roe if you find it. Though I rather like the smoke, for a more authentic salty taste, follow Rebecca Seal’s advice in The Islands of Greece and “soak the roe in cold water for a couple of hours beforehand”, which works a treat at taming the flavour.</p> \n<h2>The body</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cd16ec5cad4316200c0054cfc6ea2482e0d39a97\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431514230889/110800ae-03c0-4f75-bf54-5076cd1a7d51-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Elizabeth David's taramasalata\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth David’s taramasalata.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Though Elizabeth David’s recipe for taramasalata in her Book of Mediterranean Food is just flavoured roe, she allows that sometimes bread is added to “diminish the saltiness of the fish”, giving a “milder taste and a thicker consistency”. In some parts of Greece, mashed potato, as used in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/may/03/dip-recipes-hummus-taramasalata-salsa-10-best\">a recipe from Mazi restaurant</a> in London, or even ground almonds, as chef <a href=\"http://www.dianekochilas.com/greek-dips-for-superbowl-sunday/\">Diane Kochilas suggests, perform the same function</a>.</p> \n<p>I rather like the pungent saltiness of David’s recipe, but it does lack the creamy voluptuousness of the stuff I’m used to. Potato gives a surprisingly good, if slightly gluey, result (though I have to add rather more than suggested in the recipe to thicken it sufficiently), and almonds aren’t bad, though their sweetness needs more roe to balance them, but the bread makes the lightest versions. I prefer the more assertively fishy taramasalatas from Harley and Bareham and Hopkinson, rather than the subtler, more bread-heavy varieties, so I’ll be using a higher proportion of roe to bread.</p> \n<h2>The liquid</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d468ce314922b484cba0d7fbcae4095f3af02b6a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431514271818/fc458a98-3422-46f0-8816-6175b876e1ed-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rebecca Seal's taramasalata\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rebecca Seal’s taramasalata.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you are making a large amount, feel free to use sunflower oil, as Mazi suggest, or a mixture of sunflower and olive oil, as in the River Cottage recipe. But neither measure up to the flavour of Harley’s, where “you can taste the extra virgin olive oil in each lovely, salty morsel”. Kochilas thins it with soda water to make it “light, airy and fluffy”, and David suggests cold water, but if you use enough oil and lemon juice, neither should be necessary.</p> \n<h2>The flavourings</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b404cdf4b7ab85d7c8289bfbcbd1a9c2320d3a8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431514348726/6ed74cf7-666d-46a5-aa68-6f725105fc92-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Diane Kochalis's taramasalata\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Diane Kochalis’s taramasalata.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Harley, Mazi and the Prawn Cocktail Years put raw onion in their taramasalata (the last in the form of onion juice), while Seal goes for the sweeter shallot, and David and Kochilas stick with garlic. Though I’m not generally keen on raw onion, a moderate kick works surprisingly well with the salty fish. Finely grating it is the easiest way to ensure you don’t end up with any nasty, chunky surprises (though if you’re going for a smooth result with a food processor, you can just put it all in there for speed if you prefer).</p> \n<p>Lemon juice is a given to balance all that salty fish and onion, though I’m not convinced Mazi’s lemon zest does anything more than look pretty. A good grinding of black pepper is to be positively encouraged, but I’m not particularly keen on adding any more heat in the form of cayenne pepper or paprika, as some of the British recipes suggest. Although the green flecks of Harley’s flat-leaf parsley are attractive, I’d prefer to save it as a garnish and allow the fish to speak for itself.</p> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67a5dbbb376300a01edb379f6cffc00ae267bee5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431514398900/5c5cb975-72c4-435e-9dab-f2a3f52f5167-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Belinda Harley's taramasalata\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Belinda Harley’s taramasalata.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Seal suggests making taramasalata in “a mortar and pestle, which gives it a pleasing rustic look and chunky texture”.

The collection was unusual because the bank set out not just to commission boardroom portraits but to collect backwards – to assemble a collection that traces the history of Irish art back into the 19th century. As Frances Ruane, who advised on acquisitions, notes in her catalogue introduction, the collection outgrew the lobbies and meeting rooms until the bank’s thousands of employees became accustomed to pictures hanging on almost every wall. The bank bought the work of young contemporary artists, which was cheap, as well as the work of Yeats, Orpen and Lavery, which even in the 1980s was not. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2012/apr/26/louis-le-brocquy\">Louis le Brocquy</a>, who has several paintings and two glowing tapestries in the show, would become the first living Irish artist to smash the &pound;1m barrier at auction.</p> \n<p>Among the other works are a number of very unusual acquisitions for Irish corporatives, which document almost a century of the Troubles – from Se&aacute;n Keating’s large oil painting of <a href=\"http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/7b/Keating,_Men_of_the_South.jpg\">bored, exhausted guerrilla fighters slumped against a farm cart in the 20s</a>, to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2013/sep/29/derry-willie-doherty-retrospective-unseen\">Willie Doherty</a>’s eerie 1994 image of scorched concrete blocks closing a border road in northern Ireland, and FE McWilliam’s 1972 <a href=\"http://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/11704/women-of-belfast-ix-f-e-mcwilliam\">bronze of a woman blown sideways</a> like a bundle of twigs by a bomb blast in Belfast.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ef16932bf0019b2954fe8a14d8de9a85fe24c73\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431517151153/d09d9049-25cf-4a66-b966-4bd3bf4c7eb5-460x383.jpeg\" alt=\"On The Run: War of Independence, 1921, by S&eacute;an Keating\" width=\"460\" height=\"383\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On the Run: War of Independence (1921) by S&eacute;an Keating.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A striking 2007 canvas by the self-taught Dublin artist Shane Blount, showing his brother David mourning the loss of their sibling Joseph, closes the exhibition and virtually closed the collection. In 2008, the roar of the Celtic Tiger became a whimper, and the previously booming Irish economy, fuelled by cheap credit and soaring property prices, collapsed in the world banking crisis. AIB, like other Irish banks, was rescued by the Irish tax payer, who would cheerfully have sold off any assets that weren’t nailed down. Disposing of the AIB’s art was discussed, but in the end it was kept as a national collection, and dozens of the best works were transferred to the lovely <a href=\"http://www.crawfordartgallery.ie/\">Crawford Gallery in Cork</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5475729233794a2c2bc112f3f162c55255dfef86\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431518068967/e83abdba-c0fe-440d-a9b8-f6a29d8f0182-460x401.jpeg\" alt=\"It's a Blue Giraffe, 2007, by Shane Blount.\" width=\"460\" height=\"401\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It’s a Blue Giraffe (2007) by Shane Blount.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It would have been a great loss to the Irish people if this collection had been broken up. It’s often said from outside that Ireland produces great writers but not artists,” says curator Nicholas Usherwood. “Well this exhibition proves otherwise.”</p> \n<p>Many of the earlier works show the influence of overseas artists whom the Irish studied and worked with, including Whistler on Paul Henry’s misty western landscapes, the post-impressionists on the glowing colour of Roderic O’Connor, and an exotic landscape in which Mary Swanzy seems to have swallowed whole the work of Gauguin.</p> \n<p>“Gorgeous,” McNaught says firmly, gazing up at the Swanzy. “Yes, you can see the influences, but I think in all these works there is a softness, almost a poetic quality, that marks them out as distinctively Irish.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> The Art of a Nation: Irish Works from
