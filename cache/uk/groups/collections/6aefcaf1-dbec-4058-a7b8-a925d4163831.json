Rumour has it that Efteling inspired Walt Disney to build his own, and Disneyland Paris consulted Efteling for tips on how to better appeal to a European audience. Among its flagship rides is the grand double-track wooden rollercoaster Joris de Draak, or Joris the Dragon, in which two trains race each other around the track.

Unofficially known as Stalin’s World, the park was established to preserve the history of the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic era. Alongside the sculpture garden’s collection of 86 statues there are darker touches, such as guard towers and fragments of concentration camps (though they never went ahead with the idea of transporting visitors to the park on Gulag-style trains). There’s also a kids’ playground, Luna Park, based on Soviet times and a small zoo – presumably with animals the Russian’s didn’t send into space.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Adults &pound;4.35, kids 6-16 &pound;2.20.

It is frequented by classical white-faced clown Pjerrot, but rarely attracts visitors from outside of Denmark. And while it may not be able to compete with the high-octane thrills of modern theme parks, Bakken still has impressive rides: the grand wooden Rutschebanen coaster, built in 1932, is considered a classic.

She sensed instantly that he was troubled, but put it down to the difficulties of adapting to life back in Russia. </p> \n<p>When Dmitry began his coming out talk with the words “I want you to listen to me but this might frighten you”, she says the possibility that her son might be gay had never occurred to her.<br /></p> \n<p>“After our conversation, it was horrible,” recalls Elena. “It seemed that I was the only mother this had happened to. I tried not to show him how upset I was.”</p> \n<p> “But I was brought to my senses and comforted by something Dmitry said: ‘Now I feel much happier than when I was pretending’.”</p> \n<p>Dmitry took her to a meeting of the parents’ club a year after coming out. She expected her son to lead her into a basement where “gays live”, she says, and “when I saw that no one was dancing in tights, just decent people sitting around, I was quite surprised,” she adds. Elena quickly became a club activist and she now helps other parents to accept their LGBT children.</p> \n<p>“They usually come to us with horror in their eyes. They look as if a tragedy has befallen their family. We ask them to relax and take a look at us: do we look downtrodden? Being a parent of an LGBT child – it’s not a death sentence, you can live with it quite happily.”</p> \n<p>Acceptance can take months, if not years, she says. But if parents keep coming to the club, they always make progress. “You see mothers picking themselves up, smiling, being prepared to discuss the situation – that is already a good sign.” </p> \n<p>The mothers from the club believe that the problems with acceptance lie not with them, but with Russian society as a whole: if gay people are constantly being abused on television, why should someone suddenly believe a handful of people who take a different view?</p> \n<h2>Marina: ‘The shock lasted 10 days’</h2> \n<p>“After the coming out blows your mind, the world as it was crumbles away, together with your plans for your child’s future,” says Marina Melnik, the founder of parents’ club: her son Roman told her he was gay six years ago. Every parent in that position goes through five stages of acceptance, she explains. In her case “the shock lasted 10 days. Then came denial. That’s when you try to change their mind and prove that it’s all in their head.”</p> \n<p>She says it was painful process: “I blamed myself for a long time. Did I not love him enough or did I love him too much? When he was a kid, maybe I bought him the wrong toy, an animal, not a car.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I was scared to tell the people around me that my son was gay.

Four people came to the first meeting, she remembers, and none of them knew how to deal with their feelings of guilt.</p> \n<p>“After talking to other mothers, it finally came to me,” Marina says. That’s when she went through the last stage, acceptance, followed by her own coming out of sorts: “I was scared to tell the people around me [that my son was gay],” she remembers. “It was like that for almost a year.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbd1d6439a2b618d72bf6ef2e808028c8e3430ce\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432288122625/50b9ca34-cecf-4dd6-a145-0c85d78c4f3c-460x460.jpeg\" alt=\"LGBT in Russia\" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parents’ club activists Elena Musolina and Marina Melnik hold a sign reading: “Parental love does not depend on a child’s orientation!!!”</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Chernov/Meduza</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Igor: ‘No one talked about gay people’</h2> \n<p>Igor finally managed to bring his mother to the club two years after coming out. Until then, talking to her about anything LGBT-related was difficult, he says.</p> \n<p>“No one talked about ‘gay people’ in our family. Mum used the word ‘blues’ (Russian slang for homosexual) and dad, ‘fags’,” Igor recalls. He describes his parents as people with differing views: his dad is an orthodox patriot whose favourite political writer is <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4605613.Gregory_Klimov\">Gregory Klimov</a>, author of the aphorism: “If all is not right between the legs, all is not right between the ears.” His mother, on the other hand, isuninterested in politics and “more liberal, in a cultural sense”, he says. </p> \n<p>“When I was little, I asked my mum what sexual orientation was. ‘Who’s blue and who’s not’, she replied.” At 11, he picked up from family conversations that “gays were perverts who practise anal sex.”</p> \n<p>In September 2007, Igor left his native village in the Pskov region to go and study in St Petersburg and in October, he returned to visit his parents. “You’re nervous about something, have you fallen in love?” his mother asked him. “Yes” Igor answered, truthfully. “With a man or a woman?” she probed. With a man, as it turned out. Both of them cried but they soon calmed down and a week later, Igor went back to St Petersburg. It was not long before his father heard the news.</p> \n<p>“Dad was breaking dishes, slamming doors,” Igor says. </p> \n<p>Igor told a priest in confession that he was in love with a young man and was advised to “cure the sickness in his soul” and repent: but Igor argued back. “Officially, he absolved me of my sins but we were both clearly dissatisfied with the outcome. It was after this I lost faith in the church. That was my last communion and confession and I am feeling all right,” he laughs.</p> \n<p>Igor is convinced that if his mother watched less television, lived with him in St Petersburg and talked to other parents from the club, she would soon accept him fully. No precise statistics exist, but the club’s activists believe that for every LGBT person accepted by their family, another five are rejected.</p> \n<h2>Dmitry: ‘Sorry mum, but I’m still gay’ </h2> \n<p>Dmitry is one of these five. He first came out when he was 18. Assuming that everything would go smoothly, he didn’t prepare for the conversation. At first, his mother reacted calmly but a few hours later, she started to cry. </p> \n<p>“She shouted about HIV and how I would never have children,” he remembers. From then on, Dmitry decided not to talk to his mother about his personal life. Gradually, she seemed to forget about her son’s sexuality and their relationship improved.</p> \n<p>But Dmitry couldn’t rid himself of the feeling that his mother didn’t understand him. So three years later, he decided to try again. He prepared better this time, taking brochures from the LGBT group. But his opening gambit – “Sorry mum, but I’m still gay” – set off another argument.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0a19156a7410a5ffe0b0bf91fe6149d64886103a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432223505552/c1d5d16b-2c7f-4275-9076-cae8460b9352-460x299.jpeg\" alt=\"LGBT in Russia\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opponents of gay rights protest on the Field of Mars in St Petersburg in 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artem Sokolov/Trend/TASS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Unsure of what to do next, he went to the parents’ club, where he was advised to show his mother <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSee8On2lEQ\">the film Prayers for Bobby</a>, about a gay man who kills himself because his religious parents refused to accept him. </p> \n<p>“I watched it myself first and cried, it was so painful,” Dmitry says. “Then I watched it with mum but I didn’t understand her reaction. The parents lost their son, she said, because they didn’t believe in God or pray enough.”</p> \n<p>Religious icons soon started appearing in their flat, together with images of the Virgin Mary, Orthodox magazines and brochures about monasteries. They hadn’t spoken to each other for a long time, Dmitry says, and it was clear his mother had decided the Church was the only way to save him. </p> \n<p>“I arrived home one day and could already smell burning incense from the hallway,” he says. “What was the point, I asked her. In reply, she talked of evil influences, clouding of souls and false paths. Our flat started to resemble a church gift shop.” The arguments grew more frequent and after one such bust-up, his mother decided to move to a friend’s. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/feb/11/russia-violent-anti-gay-groups-vkontakte-lgbt-sochi\">How anti-gay groups use 'Russian Facebook' to persecute LGBT people</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Dmitry will not try his luck a third time. He tells his mother that he has a girlfriend, despite seeing his partner Grigory for over two years now. </p> \n<p>It takes a lot of energy to live a double life: when Dmitry’s mother calls him and asks him about his personal life, he answers truthfully – but substitutes the name Grigory with Irina. </p> \n<p>“Parents’ club don’t approve of stories like mine. They suggested I bring my mother along but I’m scared of what her reaction would be,” says Dmitry. “If she believes that religion helped me, so be it. The main thing is that mum is happy.”</p> \n<p><em>A version of this article <a href=\"https://meduza.io/feature/2015/04/18/kaming-aut-roditeley\">first appeared on Meduza</a>.

thousands injured and homeless, Chapagaun, which lies half an hour’s drive from Kathmandu, remains a village trapped in an anxious limbo. Many of the houses that withstood the quake and the dozens of aftershocks that have followed are too badly cracked to be habitable and their owners too fearful to set foot in them. </p> \n<p>In the absence of permanent shelter, 200 villagers have established a temporary camp in a square, where they eat and sleep together. While the men scavenge the ruins and try to demolish them brick-by-brick, the women work if they can. Children, meanwhile, play in child-friendly spaces (CFSs), hundreds of which have been set up across <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/nepal\">Nepal</a> by NGOs.

Crows swoop over tumbles of brick and concrete that were once homes and schools, beams protrude through shattered roof tiles like open fractures and entire villages lie flattened. Orange, blue, yellow and white tents and tarpaulins confetti the steeply terraced hillsides, while people and animals stare up shyly from dwellings that look incapable of sheltering any life at all.</p> \n<p>Chautara municipality, the district’s headquarters, has the look of a war zone. Many of its taller buildings list at vertiginous and improbable angles, cricket stumps smashed by a brutal ball. Around and beneath them, the hills of rubble disclose the occasional door, window and sheet of twisted corrugated iron. High up on what must have been the second floor of one house, a kitchen cupboard clings to an external wall, tins and packets of food still sitting on its shelves.</p> \n<p>Krishna Gyawali, chief district officer of Sindhupalchok, sums up the damage with a handful of numbers: 4,242 people killed across the district, 4,000 injured, 44 still missing and 95% of homes destroyed.</p> \n<p>“We’ve lost schools, health facilities and government offices,” he says. “Most of our villages are in very remote areas; it takes five days to walk to some of them with relief items, but we’re trying our best.

Sitting on the concrete stands of Tundikhel, a military parade ground in the centre of Kathmandu that is now home to hundreds of displaced families, she stresses the importance of keeping families together over the coming months.</p> \n<p>“The best thing we can do is make sure that kids stay with their parents,” she says. “The Nepalese government has put together a package to help vulnerable children – those who have lost their homes, are being looked after by neighbours, lone girls – and that needs to be properly targeted.”</p> \n<p>However, it is not just children who are at risk. Saraswoti Gautam, whose house was destroyed, brings her children to the Tundikhel camp each day but is too worried about the threat of sexual violence to stay there overnight. “We go back to another camp each night because we don’t want to share a tent with the men here,” she says.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/justine-greening\">Justine Greening</a>, the UK’s secretary of state for international development – who visited Nepal last week – said some of the &pound;33m the British government had pledged to help Nepal would be spent on protecting women and children, with &pound;10m earmarked for primary healthcare and rebuilding hospitals.</p> \n<p>“We know that primary care has been hugely disrupted by this earthquake – children not getting the immunisations and vaccinations they normally would do and pregnant women not able to give birth in a safe place with skilled midwives,” she told the Guardian. “There’s also family planning, which is critical for women.”</p> \n<p>She added: “We’re doing a lot of work around women and girls and making sure that children can stay safe. In these situations women and girls and children are always vulnerable.”</p> \n<p>Greening said that the earthquake highlighted the importance of working to prepare for natural disasters. She pointed to efforts over the past four years to preposition emergency supplies in Nepal and improve the country’s healthcare capacity.</p> \n<p>She also said <a href=\"https://www.wfp.org/news/news-release/uk%E2%80%99s-dfid-gives-%C2%A32-million-wfp-nepal-earthquake-emergency-preparedness\">&pound;2m</a> contributed by the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-international-development\">Department for International Development</a> to the construction of <a href=\"http://www.wfp.org/\">World Food Programme</a> humanitarian staging areas in Nepal had proved key to the emergency response.

The geologists may just call it an aftershock, but we call it the second quake: it’s been a double quake.”</p> \n<p>Gyawali refers to 12 May simply as the day “everything went back to zero”: within seconds, 1,000 people were running to the flat ground where the Norwegian Red Cross hospital in Chautara sits; 45 minutes after that, the first battered pick-up truck rolled into town, carrying casualties from the surrounding area.</p> \n<p>In Chapagaun, the close community suffers fresh agonies with each new tectonic twitch. A little before 3pm on Wednesday, a 4.4-magnitude tremor shook the village, sending the birds screeching into the air and the children screaming into the cover of their tarpaulin camp. It was yet another unnecessary reminder of what had happened – and what may yet lie ahead.<br /></p> \n<p>“I’m still very frightened and nervous,” says Bachulaxmi Shrestha. “I lost my home and my family has lost everything.

It has generally been considered cheap, safe and effective. But should we think harder before we pop another pill?</p>","byline":"Nic Fleming","body":"<p>You have a headache after a glass of wine too many. Your back aches from another day hunched over a keyboard. That old shoulder injury is playing up again. What do you do? There is a good chance that you will reach for the unglamorous white pills lurking in your medicine cabinet.</p> \n<p>Paracetamol is the workhorse painkiller. GPs wrote 22.5m prescriptions for it in 2013. Around 200m packets of it are sold annually, accounting for two-thirds of the UK market for over-the-counter painkillers. It is widely viewed as cheap, safe and effective.</p> \n<p>At around 2p per 500mg tablet, it certainly is cheap. But safe and effective? Although the potentially fatal consequences of taking a paracetamol overdose are well known, the widespread belief has been that the drug is mild and relatively safe if taken at the recommended dose. However, this is increasingly being questioned by scientists, who say that taking it over prolonged periods can have serious side-effects. That might seem a risk worth taking if it were not for recent research that suggests the drug either doesn’t work, or has only a very small effect for most people.</p> \n<p>Paracetamol rose to prominence during the 1960s in the wake of fears that aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen could cause gastric bleeding, ulcers and other serious side-effects. Some concerns were raised about the possibility that long-term use of paracetamol could also cause internal bleeding, but the evidence for that was mixed for many years.</p> \n<p>However,<a href=\"http://ard.bmj.com/content/70/9/1534\"> in 2011, Professor Michael Doherty</a>, a rheumatologist at Nottingham University, published a study looking at almost 900 patients aged 40 and older who took paracetamol, ibuprofen or a combination of both for chronic knee pain. When he compared the participants after 13 weeks, it came as no surprise that one in five on ibuprofen lost the equivalent of a unit of blood through internal bleeding. What was surprising was that so, too, had the same proportion of patients who were taking paracetamol.</p> \n<p>“Paracetamol can actually be a very dangerous drug,” says Dr John Dickson, who retired from general practice in Northallerton, North Yorkshire, last year. “It can cause kidney and liver problems, and causes as much gastrointestinal bleeding as the NSAIDs.”</p> \n<p>In 2013, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) even <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm363041.htm\"> issued warnings that taking paracetamol can, in some rare instances, cause potentially fatal skin conditions</a> called Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis and acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, which can cause the top layer of skin to become detached.</p> \n<p>The maximum 24-hour dose of paracetamol is 4g, but as little as 5g can cause liver complications, and it can be easy to overdose accidentally by taking more than one product containing it at the same time. “I have a headache, so I’ll take some paracetamol, and I’ve got a cold so I’ll take a cold product such as Lemsip,” says Professor Andrew Moore, a leading pain researcher at Oxford University. “People don’t necessarily look at the small print.”</p> \n<p>Last year, the <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm239821.htm\">FDA reduced the maximum dose of paracetamol</a> (called acetaminophen in the US) in tablets or capsules to 325mg to reduce the risk of accidental overdoses.</p> \n<p>In the UK, <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/clinical/more-clinical/musculoskeletal/nice-warns-against-prescribing-paracetamol-for-osteoarthritis/20003979.article#.VVx9fmQfb5o\">in draft guidelines issued in 2013,</a> the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) advised GPs that they should no longer prescribe paracetamol for osteoarthritis, suggesting it had “limited benefit” and highlighting links of higher doses to cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and renal problems. Doctors, though, were quick to criticise the new advice on the grounds that it would leave them either telling patients to simply endure their pain or lead to greater use of stronger, potentially more harmful opiate-based alternatives such as tramadol and diamorphine.</p> \n<p>In its final recommendation last year, <a href=\"http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/clinical/more-clinical/musculoskeletal/nice-forced-into-u-turn-on-advice-to-avoid-paracetamol-in-osteoarthritis/20005837.article#.VVx-umQfb5o\">Nice performed a U-turn, reinstating its previous backing of paracetamol</a>, pending the outcome of a broad review of over-the-counter painkillers by the<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency\"> Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency</a>, the results of which are due later this year.</p> \n<p>Of course, most medicines have some side-effects, and taking them always involves balancing the possible dangers against the benefits. Perhaps the downsides of paracetamol are worth the risks? Yet a 2006 review by the respected <a href=\"http://www.cochrane.org/\">Cochrane Collaboration</a> found that of seven previous studies comparing paracetamol with placebos, two found no difference in pain sensations, and the others found an improvement averaging 5%, an improvement the authors described as of “questionable clinical significance”.</p> \n<p>“For most people, it’s a placebo,” says Dickson. “It’s a bit like when they say that if you swear at your wife or your husband, you feel better. It’s the same sort of concept.”</p> \n<p>Another review of previous research published by Moore and colleagues last year found that paracetamol provided pain relief for some people with migraine and tension headaches, but was of little help for those with chronic back, cancer, post-operative, period and paediatric pain, as well as for rheumatoid and osteoarthritis. And<a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h1225\"> research published in the BMJ in March found paracetamol was ineffective for acute lower back pain</a> and that, compared with placebo, it had only a “small, clinically irrelevant” effect on pain and disability for osteoarthritis suffers. It also highlighted evidence that those taking it regularly were almost four times more likely to have abnormal liver function test results.</p> \n<p>Lead author Gustavo Machado, from the <a href=\"http://www.georgeinstitute.org/affiliates/the-university-of-sydney\">George Institute for Global Health at the University of Sydney</a>, and colleagues concluded: “Our results therefore provide an argument to reconsider the endorsement of paracetamol in clinical practice guidelines for low back pain and hip or knee osteoarthritis.”</p> \n<p>The real problem is that the old model of judging drugs on the basis of research that averages out their effects makes little sense when these can vary dramatically between individuals. “What we’re recognising now is that with paracetamol, as with all analgesics, there are some people for whom it can provide good pain relief and others in whom it has no effect at all,” says Moore. In such cases, perhaps it makes sense for patients to take a greater role in managing their own treatment, working with medical professionals to find out what works for them.</p> \n<p>Many GPs are starting to take this more nuanced approach to the use of paracetamol. Two years ago when Nice was considering withdrawing its backing of the drug as the first choice treatment for chronic osteoarthritic pain, the Royal College of General Practitioners was among those who complained the loudest. Now, however, Dr Martin Johnson of the RCGP says the status quo that drives GPs to prescribe prolonged use of paracetamol for millions of these patients no longer makes sense.</p> \n<p>“If you look at asthma or diabetes, these are really well self-managed conditions because people are empowered, but we’re not used to the concept of self-management of pain. In fact, patients shouldn’t be using paracetamol habitually. Rather, they should take them when they have pain and when when they’re going to do something that normally provokes pain, such a going for a long walk. They should also consider other ways to manage pain such as hot baths and stretching exercises.”</p> \n<p>Dickson agrees that a difficult shift in the mindset of doctors and patients on how to use paracetamol and other painkillers is overdue. “Doctors have traditionally said, ‘No, you shouldn’t have pain, and we’ll give you something to stop it,’” he says. “What we have to get across to people is that pain itself isn’t doing any harm, it’s not something you can cure and sometimes it makes sense not to take anything. We have to learn to manage pain more proportionately.</p> \n<p>“It’s not going to be easy because it’s a cultural problem, but my view is that within five years we will no longer be prescribing paracetamol for chronic pain relief.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432316638772/Paracetamol---should-you--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Paracetamol - should you keep taking the tablets?

But shame prevents the well-off from showing solidarity","byline":"Zoe Williams","body":"<p>What is a “middle-class” expense? <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/household-bills/11622867/How-middle-class-inflation-is-threatening-your-standard-of-living.html\" title=\"\">According to the Daily Telegraph</a>, after considerable dialogue with its own readers, the key items in the portfolio of the bourgeoisie are as follows: school fees, dental care, health insurance, holidays, wine (fine), new cars, holidays and “cultural activities”. The price rises in all these areas have been astronomical – health insurance has gone up by 51% over the past six years, school fees by 40% – while over the same period earnings in the double-average-wage bracket have gone down by 0.8%.</p> \n<p>Private school fees are paid by 7% of the population; private health insurance is taken out by 11%. This isn’t really the middle: the determination to retain the term middle class for those who are actually wealthy is akin to the care with which the right wing never describes its views as rightwing, preferring “commonsense”. It is a constant project to reframe what is normal in the image of what is normal for one person in 10.</p> \n<p>But actually, on this matter, the middle classes are pretty normal. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/datablog/2014/nov/19/uk-workers-suffer-sixth-year-of-falling-real-pay-in-2014\" title=\"\">Income has stagnated across every section of society</a> apart from the top 1% (whom the Telegraph would probably call upper middle or well-to-do). GDP per capita is lower than it was seven years ago. “That,” said the economist Joseph Stiglitz <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/24/joseph-stiglitz-interview-uk-economy-lost-decade-zero-growth\" title=\"\">in an interview</a> on Sunday “is not a success.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The extent to which we are all in this wage-stagnating swamp together is a question of age rather than class</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s hard for the wealthy to mobilise around their declining living standards. Their options are limited. When so much of your wealth is spent avoiding the social structures on which solidarity is based – education, the health service, our crap dentistry of international renown – who do you complain to? Who are you going to stand shoulder to shoulder with? Your outrage at the world is limited in its expression to your power as a consumer. That’s why the incredibly angry, bright pink man yelling at a BT helpline is such a staple of modern British sitcoms; as a guardian angel against feelings of impotence and injustice, BT can’t really help – even if it does answer the phone.</p> \n<p>So there’s the stain of self-interest barring entry to the language and power and solace of unity. There’s also a huge amount of shame involved in being in debt or struggling, especially against the backdrop of assumption that privilege is somehow the result of a lifetime’s sound financial decisions.</p> \n<p>There’s a public pressure not to mention declining living standards, because that would be to insult people whose living standards have declined to the point of being unable to eat. There’s also a private pressure, since the status of the affluent is, of course, rooted in the affluence – and if one breaks ranks to say there’s actually quite a lot of anxiety involved, it makes everyone look bad.</p> \n<p>Oh, and one other huge impediment: nobody wants you for an ally when your complaint is that health insurance has gone up three times as fast as wages. Had housing been added to the Telegraph’s basket of middle-class goods, they would have seen that, for the older homeowner with a mortgage, the rise in other prices is offset somewhat by the very low interest rates. But they would also have seen that the “middle-class” renter, or even the renter who actually is middle class, is suffering rent rises with no respect to wages, insecurity of tenancy, crummy conditions and life-changingly large proportions of income going on housing costs – very similar conditions, in other words, to everyone else.</p> \n<p>The extent to which we are all in this wage-stagnating, price-increasing swamp together is a question of age rather than class. A middle-class person coming out of university is part of the private personal debt boom; a middle-class person under 30 is a victim of the rentier economy. When you strip out the peculiar lottery-win of being over 40 in the housing market, you can see the picture more clearly: everyone who earns, now earns less, while, by incredible coincidence, the ratio between profit and wages has tipped in the shareholders’ favour.</p> \n<p>It is deeply ingrained in our political culture that classes must be held in opposition to one another; and a confluence of interests between the middle and the bottom is only possible when the bottom tries to emulate or join the middle (sorry, did I say tries? Of course I meant aspires).</p> \n<p>It cuts across the spectrum – on the left, you would never want to preach allegiance between the person hit by the bedroom tax and the person who can’t afford the second holiday. On the right, you would never admit that there was any systemic connection between falling wages for the bottom decile, and falling wages for the eighth.</p> \n<p>But considering them together would make it easier to see the patterns: wage depression never conveniently stopped at the bottom 20%, there is little brake on corporate power, and credit is allowing prices in every sphere to peel away from earnings. These trends are obscured by the rather dated political determination that “the needy” must be interested in one kind of politics, and “the aspirational” a completely different kind. Better to acknowledge the similarities in the situations we all face.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432486641628/Jasper-Rietman-illustrati-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jasper Rietman illustration  Photograph: Jasper Rietman","credit":"Jasper Rietman","altText":"Jasper Rietman illustration ","cleanCaption":"Jasper Rietman illustration  Photograph: Jasper Rietman"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-24T17:05:43Z","lastModified":"2015-05-24T23:00:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1024,"contributors":[{"name":"Zoe Williams","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733751535/ZoeWilliams.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/zoewilliams"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Equality","Private schools","Health insurance","Housing","Life and style","Communities","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"society/equality","webTitle":"Equality"},{"id":"education/private-schools","webTitle":"Private schools"},{"id":"money/healthinsurance","webTitle":"Health insurance"},{"id":"society/housing","webTitle":"Housing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/communities","webTitle":"Communities"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Zoe Williams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/zoewilliams"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/24/middle-class-living-standards","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4978k","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/may/24/middle-class-living-standards","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/24/middle-class-living-standards"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/24/1432486641628/Jasper-Rietman-illustrati-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration by Jasper Rietman","credit":"Jasper Rietman","altText":"Jasper Rietman illustration ","cleanCaption":"Illustration by Jasper Rietman"}},"importance":2,"byline":{"title":"Zoe Williams"},"showQuotedHeadline":true},{"title":"Gardening / It's good for your health.

Then you’ve been enjoying some “horticultural therapy”. A growing number of GPs and healthcare professionals are “prescribing” gardening to improve their patients’ health. In fact, the benefits of just being able to see a green space from a window is said to be worth &pound;300 per person per year to the economy.But what’s good for your health is not always healthy for your wallet, and gardening can be an expensive hobby. Estimates of the typical spend on gardens by UK households range from &pound;123 a year to as much as &pound;30,000 over your lifetime, according to research by <a href=\"http://www.poundstretcher.co.uk/garden-outdoor\">Poundstretcher</a> and <a href=\"http://www.gardeningexpress.co.uk\">Gardeningexpress.co.uk</a>. We asked a range of experts to give us their top money-saving tips:</p> \n<p><strong>Get to know your garden<br /></strong>“A mistake most gardeners make when starting out is to buy lots of expensive plants without taking into consideration the requirements of each plant, which often results in a waste of money and effort,” says Veronica Perez Diaz, gardener for <a href=\"http://www.betterbankside.co.uk/businesses/borough-market\">Better Bankside and Borough Market</a> in south London. To avoid this, she recommends “getting to know your space” so you can identify sunny spots and plant accordingly.</p> \n<p><strong>Talk to your neighbours<br /></strong>“Look at neighbouring gardens to see what is growing well,” says Sue Harris, head gardener at the <a href=\"http://www.quexpark.co.uk/museum/\">Powell-Cotton Museum</a> in Kent. This will help you to avoid buying plants that won’t thrive.</p> \n<p><strong>Be realistic<br /></strong>“The most common mistake gardeners make is buying too many seeds that don’t get sown. It’s a false economy to spend &pound;20 on 500 seeds when you simply don’t have room to nurture them,” says Tony Woods, founder of landscape garden company <a href=\"http://www.gardenclublondon.co.uk\">Garden Club London</a>. “Be patient – wait and see what comes up.”</p> \n<p><strong>Take an organic approach<br /></strong>This not only benefits wildlife, it saves you money, says Perez Diaz. “Nurturing the soil with your own home compost or using a homemade nettle plant feed won’t cost a penny.”</p> \n<p><strong>Stay focused at the garden centre<br /></strong>“Many larger garden centres and nurseries price plants, particularly shrubs, based on the pot size, so be sure to avoid paying extra for a newly-potted plant in a big pot,” says Woods.</p> \n<p>By the same token, he says look out for herbaceous perennials that have been grown in two- or three-litre pots: “Many will have been potted at the nursery more than 12 months ago, and can be divided into three to five smaller plants that will establish quickly if given a cutback after dividing and plenty of water.”</p> \n<p><strong>Be on the hunt for bargains<br /></strong>Don’t assume the best plants are always to be had from garden centres: “Good buys can often be had from charity plant stands,” says Harris. “The National Trust, for example, run some excellent plant fairs.” Family, friends and neighbours may also be willing to give you cuttings and seeds from their own gardens.</p> \n<p><strong>Do “companion planting”<br /></strong>This will attract beneficial insects and deter unwanted pests,” says Perez Diaz. “For example, grow tomatoes with marigold, chives and garlic to repel white and black fly, instead of buying harmful pesticides.”</p> \n<p><strong>Be organised<br /></strong>“Label the best plants or make a plan of your garden as some ‘disappear’ over winter – these can easily be weeded out by accident or lost through digging,” warns Harris. She also recommends planning ahead. “For example, bare root wallflowers are cheap in autumn, while cuttings from pelargoniums are easy to strike and will survive a winter on most windowsills.”</p> \n<p>A “much cheaper option” than buying at a garden centre, she says, is to go there to look at what is in flower, then plan to grow one next year.</p> \n<p><strong>Stick to a routine<br /></strong>“The most important thing when gardening is not to set yourself up to fail,” says Ian Kavanagh of <a href=\"http://www.mungosbroadway.org.uk/pdr\">Putting Down Roots</a>, a gardening group for homeless people run by St Mungo’s Broadway in west London. “Have discipline and stick to a routine. You need to allow plenty of time when tending to your garden; many people rush what they are doing which results in their plants drying out. Starting again costs double the price.”</p> \n<p><strong>Collect seeds<br /></strong>“Collecting and storing seeds, keeping tubers and propagating plants using cuttings from mature plants are all excellent ways to produce dozens of new plants from a single flower for free,” says Dawn Ewing of <a href=\"http://bumblebeeconservation.org\">Bumblebee Conservation Trust</a>, which offers guides on seed collecting and taking plant cuttings on its blog.</p> \n<p><strong>Use the internet<br /></strong>There are a number of good money-saving gardening websites, including:</p> \n<p>■ <a href=\"http://gardenswapshop.co.uk\">Gardenswapshop.co.uk </a>and <a href=\"http://growfruitandveg.co.uk/grapevine/seed-swap/\">Growfruitandveg.co.uk/grapevine/seed-swap/</a>.

I got blue tits, great tits, goldfinches and robins coming to feed from them.”</p> \n<p>His neighbours were so impressed, they gave him cuttings of nectar-rich flowers and seeds from their gardens as gifts.
