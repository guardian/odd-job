But everyone was talking about the rapper – even Sunday’s closing act the Who, says Alexis Petridis</p>","byline":"Alexis Petridis","body":"<p>There are many diverting sights to take in at Glastonbury: everything from Pussy Riot forcing a gun-toting man to wear a rainbow balaclava in the name of politically charged performance art, to the Dalai Lama addressing the stone circle on Sunday morning, traditionally a time when it is largely populated not by seekers of spiritual insight but by people who haven’t been to bed since Thursday, struggling to uncross their eyeballs. But one thing you almost never see is a performer using a torrential downpour of rain to their advantage, which is one of the things that makes <strong>Mary J Blige</strong>’s Friday afternoon appearance on the Pyramid stage a genuinely remarkable event. She announces that she’s never been to Glastonbury before – handy clarification for anyone who thought they saw the self-styled Queen of Hip-Hop Soul down the front for Ozric Tentacles in 93 – but her performance is dazzlingly slick. Then she plays a startlingly intense version of the title track of her 2001 album No More Drama, crouching on the rain-lashed lip of the stage, as if she’s treating the elements as a special effect, amping up the song’s harrowing, cathartic power. Her voice is incredible, all the more so if you’ve spent the earlier part of the afternoon listening to some pretty wan-sounding alt-rock bands. When it ends, the audience goes so nuts for so long that her band can’t start the next song. Looking out over the field, Blige bursts into tears.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dde0a2a9432df12eeed34ee9fb85c51303e5f1b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508437217/f5519297-e292-4dd1-8bd1-a536aa07aff3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Redferns via Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You can’t accuse Friday’s Pyramid stage bill of lacking eclecticism. Blige is followed by <strong>Mot&ouml;rhead</strong>, a band whose immutability is part of their appeal. Their sound is like a multistorey car park: grey, hard, wilfully ugly, cast in concrete in 1976. But this evening, Lemmy cuts a surprisingly frail figure onstage, and the band seem somehow sapped of their raw power: it feels tinny and sluggish. A similar problem affects <strong>the Libertines</strong>, who fill the gap left by Florence + the Machine’s elevation to headline status: their ricketiness is part of their appeal, and their set might well sound great in a smaller venue, but in a vast space like this it seems undernourished and insubstantial.</p> \n<p>“We spent our entire stage production budget on making the sun come out,” yells El-P of <strong>Run the Jewels</strong>, triumphantly, as the duo arrive on the West Holts stage. “Yeah, $82,” deadpans his partner, Killer Mike. It’s true that there isn’t a great deal to Run the Jewels’ live show: just the pair of them and a DJ. But it works, even in front of a huge crowd: the duo are incredibly charismatic onstage. There’s something infectious about their obvious delight at finding the biggest success of their respective careers as middle age approaches and they have an ability to seamlessly switch the mood from wit to fury and back again. At the other extreme, <strong>Mark Ronson</strong> pulls out all the production stops, and that works too: there’s something faintly overwhelming about his show on the Other stage, which features BMX bikers, double-dutch skippers, his band performing to a recording of the late Amy Winehouse singing Valerie and a plethora of special guests. Boy George sings Do You Really Want to Hurt Me? in a top hat with fake dreadlocks attached to it. For the concluding Uptown Funk, Ronson is joined not just by Mary J Blige, but Grandmaster Flash and George Clinton of Parliament-Funkadelic: it’s a totally joyous performance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d58536e41fbe91126cc05560329e93ddce653dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508513615/e5f74f68-bf30-4910-8781-42cc415a84e5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Ronson at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Ronson at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Also clearly making an effort are substitute headliners <strong>Florence + the Machine</strong>. Florence Welch doesn’t so much seize the opportunity as grab it by the throat and wrestle it to the ground. She does everything to win over the audience short of offering to pack up their tents for them on Monday morning. She repeatedly ventures into the crowd, much to the consternation of the bouncers. She puts a flower garland on her head, proffered by a fan. She encourages audience members to clamber on their partners’ shoulders. She asks the audience if they want to get high: this being Glastonbury, the answer is a resounding yes. She talks about ley lines. She reminisces about the days when she played in an outlying tea tent at the festival, “but I had a feeling everything was beautiful”. She throws shapes with such abandon that we occasionally seem to be venturing perilously close to the world of interpretive dance. It veers between ridiculous, entertainingly ridiculous, faintly irritating and authentically endearing. The crowd love it, aided by the fact that the main stage at Glastonbury potentiates grandiose gestures and anthemic music: for better or for worse, a headlining set at the festival is no place to start exploring your music’s more arcane subtleties, as Kanye West will subsequently discover. A woman whose music doesn’t really have that many subtleties to explore in the first place, Welch is ideally placed: You Got the Love provokes a mass singalong, and it’s hard to begrudge her her unexpected moment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b14d736d25955a96a9f1ac457e2ae2105a5e9a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435511329536/4499ba9c-22ca-4e77-9e00-8d454962ac2e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Florence Welch on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florence Welch on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Saturday dawns with the beautiful sound of <strong>the Unthanks</strong> singing folk songs accompanied by an orchestra, but the John Peel stage offers shouting. <strong>Slaves</strong> are raw-throated and estuary-accented, but their take on punk is more lighthearted than it first appears: indeed, on their more jokey tracks, such as Where’s Your Car Debbie?, the ghost of Splodgenessabounds’ Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please lurks improbably around. And then it’s <strong>Sleaford Mods</strong>, whose approach to the festival offers an intriguing contrast to the standard “we’re-so-grateful-to-be-here-this-is-a-dream-come-true” approach. “The toilets are fucking shit here,” opines Jason Williamson. “Everything’s fucking shit here.” Their set is relentlessly powerful: Williamson is magnetic, Jobseeker and Fizzy’s howls of despair and anger genuinely hit a nerve with the audience. “Got a bit tense that, didn’t it?” he nods after the latter comes to an end. “Got a bit carried away.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere <strong>Clean Bandit</strong> draw a huge crowd to the Other stage. You can see why Rather Be was a huge hit – it’s got a massive, inescapable hook – and they cover Robin S’s 1993 hit Show Me Love, a record that was audibly hugely influential on the the current wave of vastly successful pop-house, but their brand of dance music still feels devoid of grit, as antiseptic as the hand gel you’re advised to use after visiting one of the lavatories that so upset the guy from Sleaford Mods. Over on the Park stage, meanwhile, <strong>Father John Misty</strong> is in full flow. It’s not just that singer-songwriter Josh Tillman’s music sounds substantially more aggressive and less obviously indebted to mid-70s LA rock live than on record, although it does. It’s that Tillman himself is a brilliant performer. Besuited and luxuriantly bearded, he manages to exude an aura of sleazy malevolence while hamming it up relentlessly: dropping to the floor, plunging into the crowd, clambering on top of his drummer’s kit to perform the title track of I Love You Honeybear, thrusting his pelvis as he sings the title of When You Are Smiling and Astride Me, examining the selection of festival wristbands on his arm between songs: “This one means I’m underage, ladies.” It’s simultaneously hugely entertaining and slightly discomfiting, an impressive trick to pull off.</p> \n<p><strong>Pharrell Williams</strong>’s Saturday evening performance on the Pyramid stage offers a rather more straightforward approach. In fact, it’s got a hint of the light-entertainment spectacular about it: he brings on a chorus of children to sing Happy, invites a load of festival-goers to dance behind him – rather shamelessly, the handful of men among them are hastily ushered offstage – and offers a lot of slightly oily patter about the beautiful ladies of England. He cedes the stage to a female dance troupe called the Baes and brings on a woman who stands on her head and walks on her hands. Williams sings She Wants to Move to her inverted form, which looks a bit peculiar, as if he’s addressing the song to her crotch. Elsewhere, he smartly takes the same approach to his live show as Nile Rodgers of Chic, performing not just his solo material, but tracks he has produced or written or guested on, which means the set is almost comically overstuffed with hits: Blurred Lines, Get Lucky, Drop It Like It’s Hot, Hot In Herre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e705da2382239e6f75e22d7b7d227b54806d8848\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508595573/eac96cd4-42df-409c-9893-74e8ec0a804d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pharrell Williams at Glastonbury.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pharrell Williams at Glastonbury.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tabatha Fireman/Redferns via Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It all makes for an intriguing contrast with what follows: while Williams goes out of his way to win over the crowd, <strong>Kanye West</strong> doesn’t bother. There are no dancers, no grand special effects, no sense of an artist turning on the charm: just West, rapping underneath a vast ceiling of glaring white lights. There’s something admirable about his bloody-minded determination to do everything on his terms, rather than cravenly court the audience’s affections, and the opening burst of songs is genuinely thrilling. The staging is starkly impressive, his performance is forceful, not even a stage invader can blunt Black Skinhead’s edge. But for something that, according to one of West’s few onstage announcements, involved an entire creative team to stage, it’s a weirdly disjointed and uneven show. He cuts big hits short, not least Gold Digger, but extends a performance of Lost in the World, a beatless Auto-Tuned ballad featuring a guest appearance from Justin Vernon of indie folk band Bon Iver: it comes decorated with a monolgue about the song’s creation and a lot of camera closeups of West looking pensive and melancholy on the stageside screens. As the intro to Touch the Sky begins, he suddenly stops the song, mutters “that’s not what we rehearsed in the dressing room” and vanishes. He reappears performing the song on the platform of a cherry picker. It would be spectacular stagecraft were it not for the fact that there’s a vast gap before he resurfaces: the stage is black and silent, the show’s momentum is lost. It fitfully sparks again: during All the Lights and Jesus Walks, when he performs a cover of Queen’s Bohemian Rhapsody, despite the fact that the latter demonstrates that without Auto-Tune, West’s singing voice is no great shakes.</p> \n<p>As the set ends, he repeatedly informs the audience that they are watching “the greatest living rock star on the planet”. He has a point. If you think that it’s the job of rock stars to be grandiloquent, complex, controversial and occasionally ridiculous figures, so remote from everyday life that they seem almost otherworldly, then it’s hard to think of anyone currently doing a better job. The problem is that tonight’s performance doesn’t back the claim up: it offers flickers of greatness rather than a blaze of glory. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7874b4d7aac0e3ae1a42acca63ade05279b592a0\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7874b4d7aac0e3ae1a42acca63ade05279b592a0/0_43_2868_1719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Patti Smith … feel the power.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"599\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Patti Smith … feel the power.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The next day, the lead singer of <strong>Fat White Family</strong> exposes his genitals on the Park stage, <strong>Lionel Richie</strong> draws what looks suspiciously like the biggest crowd of the festival and spends virtually his entire show wearing a cartoonish OMG expression at their vociferous reaction: they even love it when he neglects to play Easy in favour of a version of USA For Africa’s We Are The World. <strong>Patti Smith</strong> brings the Dalai Lama onto the Pyramid stage in the middle of an astonishing, incendiary set: she ends with a cover of the Who’s My Generation, tearing the strings off her guitar as it shrieks and howls. She even manages to make falling over seem cool. “I fell on my ass at Glastonbury because I’m an ANIMAL!” she growls by way of explanation.</p> \n<p>“What a night you’ve got,” says <strong>Paul Weller</strong> gruffly, not, one suspects, a man who’s ever been much given to spending his weekends trudging through mud with glitter on his face carrying a flag that says PAUL AND SPUD’S BARMY ARMY. “Not just us but the Who as well.” The audience roar: there are people here in FUCK KANYE T-shirts, a lot of blokes with Liam Gallagher hair. But these days, at least, Weller is nowhere near as musically conservative as some of his fans. The hits understandably get the biggest response – Changing Man, You Do Something To Me, That’s Entertainment, a slightly trudgy version of Start!, a sparkier take on A Town Called Malice that concludes the set – but the most intriguing stuff he plays is off his most recent album, Saturn’s Pattern: if it’s less fragmented and strange than its predecessor, Sonik Kicks, there’s still something exploratory and off-kilter about the piano-powered title track, and the dense, ominous psychedelia of opener White Sky.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"89c33a3d1057c76943666dfd19476504ff641b64\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/89c33a3d1057c76943666dfd19476504ff641b64/0_41_3000_1802/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of the Who.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Their generation: Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend of the Who.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Hussein/Redferns via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The Who</strong>, claims Pete Townshend – even more gruffly than Paul Weller – have “an easy job”: “we ’ave to send you ’ome ’appy.” They do this by rolling out the hits in quick succession: Who Are You, The Seeker, Pictures of Lily, Behind Blue Eyes. My Generation now comes with an odd, slow little coda in place of the old explosive, Keith Moon-fuelled ending that’s presumably there to circumvent the inevitable question of what a 71-year-old man is doing singing the line about hoping he dies before he gets old: “My generation, we’re still here today.” From a projection at the back of the stage, the young Moon stares down, doe-eyed.</p> \n<p>Daltrey can still swing a microphone around with considerable panache, but his voice is rougher than it was. Even so, it still has a powerful belligerence about it that matches the sound of Townshend’s guitar and brings out the distrust and paranoia at the heart of I Can See For Miles. The guitarist seems a bit underwhelmed by the set. “It could have been better,” he says, before a version of Won’t Get Fooled Again that sounds great. The band didn’t get to soundcheck, he complains, although frankly no one would have known if he hadn’t mentioned it. And then he raises an amused eyebrow at Kanye West’s line about being the greatest rock star on the planet.</p> \n<p>Still, the next morning, it’s still the only thing that people at Glastonbury are talking about. West appears to have succeeded in making the biggest music festival in Europe all about him, which is an achievement in itself.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508233729/8b8f977a-7f72-4518-af79-13a1240aa609-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Samir Hussein/Redferns via Getty","altText":"Bohemian rapsody (geddit): Kanye does Glastonbury","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Samir Hussein/Redferns via Getty"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508438577/f5519297-e292-4dd1-8bd1-a536aa07aff3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mary J Blige performs at Glastonbury.

Quick as a flash, there was&nbsp;one withering&nbsp;reply: “I&nbsp;thought people went&nbsp;to Glastonbury to get away from that stuff.”</p> \n<p>When writing about this festival, you inevitably have to push through a great force-field of received opinion. Quiet apart from the idea of “Glasto” as some ephemeral, hedonistic bunfight, there are all those arguments about what has happened to its spirit over the past 10 or 15 years, usually phrased in the form of sneers. The festival has changed, but&nbsp;then so has the world. Walking around its seemingly infinite expanse and comparing it to the event I first attended, in 1990 – the last year before the organisers let the police in, when one could freely buy breakfast from a hash-cake salesman before meeting friends who had got in for nothing – feels like contrasting very different versions of the same thing. But&nbsp;so does&nbsp;comparing the Britain of now with the country that was about to&nbsp;say goodbye to Margaret Thatcher. Most worthwhile elements of our culture grow and develop, occasionally in ways&nbsp;some people do not like.</p> \n<p>And in fact, Glastonbury – which, when I first came, was known as the Glastonbury CND festival – still has a radical, egalitarian spirit that can be picked up all over the site (the logos on your wristband, just to hammer the point home, are not those of beer companies, but of Greenpeace, WaterAid and Oxfam). This year, the first thing that came into view as you approached the Pyramid stage was a towering set of protest artworks built around a sculpture of a crab eating a missile, and the words “Scrap Trident”. And 10 minutes walk away, as usual, was the slightly misnamed Left Field: actually a giant tent, curated by that enduring Glastonbury icon Billy Bragg, in which the daytime is given over to debate and songwriters’ workshops, while the evening features full live sets&nbsp;with a political tilt. It has been here&nbsp;since 2002, and became known as the spiritual home of that proud English&nbsp;nonconformist Tony Benn, who&nbsp;made one of his last public appearances here in June 2013.</p> \n<p>From Friday to Sunday, I chaired five of this year’s daytime debates. In retrospect, last year’s sessions were sometimes made uneasy and inconclusive by the prospect of a general election, and by people’s ambivalent feelings about the Labour party.</p> \n<p>This time, the contributions from both platform and floor – or, rather, grass – felt newly unbound, and built on a set of questions – some of them agonised. To paraphrase: where do we go from here? What issues will define the next five years? And might the seemingly grim state of British politics&nbsp;be in any way improved?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>At the most packed sessions, the thought sprang to mind: here was a political tribe cohering right in front of us</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Each debate drew at least a couple of hundred people, some three or four times that number. In most cases the majority of the crowd seemed to be under 30. Judging by their interest in the speakers from Syriza and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/podemos\" title=\"\">Podemos</a>, and the huge audience that gathered to watch me interview those<a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/pussy-riot\" title=\"\"> estimable Russian feminists Pussy Riot</a>, their politics tends to be internationalised and well informed. When the crowd in the tent heard from the Scottish activists Cat Boyd – of the Radical Independence Campaign – and Pat Kane, there was asense that Scotland’s political reformation has finally cut through in England, and at least some people are trying to learn from it.</p> \n<p>When I straw-polled a 1,000-strong crowd at the closing debate, people fell 50-50 between Labour and the Greens, though the former party should take note: on the evidence of only one person asking a question about the leadership contest all weekend, it has not fired anyone’s imagination, and may well be making deeper problems even worse. Very quickly, it seemed to dissolve into irrelevance while a much more vivid story was revealed: the fact that at a time when it is too easy to fall into a vacant kind of despair, every session gave voice to a palpable sense of hope – difficult to articulate or even justify sometimes, but there nonetheless.</p> \n<p>At the most packed sessions, the thought sprang to mind again and again: here was an identifiable political tribe cohering right in front of us. To somewhat selectively quote from Paul Mason’s Why It’s All Kicking Off Everywhere, a lot of the people who came to the Left Field echoed his description of the 21st century’s new breed of young activists as “a new sociological type ... They are not prone to traditional and endemic ideologies ... The common theme is dissolution of centralised power and the demand for ‘autonomy’ and personal freedom.” This last point rings very true: though some people still cleave to a politics that speaks the language of old-school socialism or class war (“Is it time for a general strike?” asked one hopeful attendee), even their views intersect with a larger tendency that puts a bigger emphasis on democracy and the need to&nbsp;fundamentally change broken political systems, along with an assertive kind of identity politics chiefly&nbsp;manifested in feminism.</p> \n<p>In that context, that hackneyed old phrase “We are the 99%” feels now as much focused on representation as redistribution. Indeed, what many of these people have taken from recent events – and particularly the rise of Podemos in Spain – is that the latter will not occur without the former. One question about the need for proportional representation met with huge applause, and the issue came up again and again: proof that changing the voting system is no longer an issue for anoraks but the basis of a visceral collective wish for change. Bragg himself increasingly predicates his politics on accountability, and on reining in concentrations of power, corporate and political.</p> \n<p>From to time, when the conversation became a little cliched, or the idea that the Tories were about to crumble into disarray was voiced a bit too loudly, the word “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/12/can-the-explanation-for-labours-election-failure-be-found-in-nuneaton\" title=\"\">Nuneaton</a>” passed through my mind, and I was reminded of how far the left – if we can still talk meaningfully about “the left” – has to go. But reasons for guarded optimism extended into the distance.</p> \n<p>A five-minute, off-the-cuff speech by Charlotte Church proved that uncompromising resistance to just about everything the current government wants to do need not sound sour and shrill but could be empathetic and human. Shami Chakrabarti did a beautiful job of underlining the grave threat posed by what <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/law/2015/jun/01/human-rights-act-repeal-tory-peer\" title=\"\">the government wants to do to our human rights</a>. But perhaps the most impressive people were the activists who just told their stories: Jasmine Stone from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2014/dec/31/focus-e15-mothers-newham-council\" title=\"\">Focus E15 Mothers</a>; Zoe Blackwell, who came to Glastonbury from the Wirral, and talked about devoting all her spare time to fighting plans to frack the ground beneath her neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>At the end of the aforementionedfeminism session, I went out into the crowd and chatted to Francesca Scanlon, an 18-year-old sixth former from Whitley Bay. This was not just her first Glastonbury but her first festival. “I think it’s brilliant,” she said, before telling me she had seen the Vaccines, the Courteeners and Florence + the Machine. But then she talked about the&nbsp;festival’s political aspect. “You get a real kind of leftwing, liberal feeling here,” she said. “It’s really free. Where I’m from isn’t like that: it’s quite right wing.” What came next underlined what old-school socialists would call fellowship: the feeling of being among like minds, and taking inspiration from them. “I feel at home,” she said.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435510615134/Revellers-walk-past-an-ar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Glastonbury has an egalitarian spirit that can be picked up all over the site.'

Here are a few blunders best avoided","byline":"Philip Ball","body":"<p>The news that Disney is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/24/disney--charles-darwin-movie\" title=\"\">planning an “adventure film” about Charles Darwin</a> sounds at first blush rather ominous. The idea that Darwin had “a bit of that Indiana Jones-like swashbuckling spirit in him”, <a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/06/darwin-stephen-gaghan-disney-adventure-film-1201452175/\" title=\"\">as noted in the report on the Hollywood-watching website Deadline</a>, only heightens suspicions that the mild-mannered naturalist will be seen fighting off pirates and wrestling giant iguanas on the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/galapagos-islands\" title=\"\">Gal&aacute;pagos</a>. But it would be unfair to write off the project – to be directed by Stephen Gaghan, who wrote the Oscar-winning screenplay for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Observer_review/0,,430492,00.html\" title=\"\">Steven Soderbergh’s Traffic</a> – before we know anything more about it. Disney has at least <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/dec/12/how-fairytales-grew-up-frozen\" title=\"\">shown itself now capable</a> of producing more than sweet, passive princesses.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/24/disney--charles-darwin-movie\">Disney incubating new Charles Darwin movie</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And if, as has been hinted, the movie focuses on the young Darwin’s exploits on the voyage of the Beagle, there’s no shortage of genuine drama to draw upon. The expedition, led by the bumptious and aristocratic <a href=\"http://www.icr.org/article/fitzroy-captain-beagle-fierce-critic-darwinism/\" title=\"\">Captain Robert FitzRoy</a>, was threatened by tribesmen at Tierra del Fuego and bandits in Peru, had to put down a rebellion on the Falkland Islands, battled terrifying storms at Cape Horn, encountered waterspouts and whales. (Whether Darwin will seem so swashbuckling if the film is honest about his chronic sea-sickness is another matter.) The locations alone promise a visual feast: Darwin saw the volcanoes and glaciers in the high Andes, the sun-baked Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, the coral reefs of Tahiti and the rolling hills of New Zealand. In the primeval forests of South America he was moved with religious awe, calling them “temples filled with the varied productions of the God of Nature.”</p> \n<p>No, Darwin the movie won’t have to strain or exaggerate to capture a sense of romance, danger and grandeur. The tougher issue is how to use these adventures to convey Darwin’s great insight – the greatest insight of all time, in the estimation of some scientists – that life on Earth evolves by natural selection.</p> \n<p>We’ll have to assume for now that Disney is going to accept the likelihood of poor box-office returns, not to mention pickets and bans, in the US bible belt – a biopic that shied away from the full implications of “Darwin’s dangerous idea”, as Daniel Dennett has put it, would be an absurdity. But ideological ignorance aside, how does one illustrate the evolution of Darwin’s own discoveries?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We’ll have to assume Disney is going to accept poor box office returns, pickets and bans in the US bible belt</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In the rash of science biopics popular during the interwar years, before the history of science became a serious academic discipline, no one batted an eyelid at the portrayal of great scientists as noble seekers of truth who received inspiration in a revelatory eureka moment. These days that will no longer do.</p> \n<p>Not only do we recognise that scientific discovery hardly ever happens this way (even if scientists themselves still like to tidy up and idealise their retrospective accounts), but it typically doesn’t spring from lone individuals. Darwin’s case is particularly well scrutinised: not only did <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2013/jan/20/alfred-russel-wallace-forgotten-man-evolution\" title=\"\">Alfred Russel Wallace have much the same idea at the same time</a>, but there are other lesser-known claimants too, especially the naturalists <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Blyth\" title=\"\">Edward Blyth</a> and <a href=\"http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/friedman/Early_Evolution/Early_Evolution/Matthew.html\" title=\"\">Patrick Matthew</a>. There is a fairly compelling case that the latter two failed to see, as Darwin did, how natural selection – “survival of the fittest”, in Herbert Spencer’s misleading phrase – could be a general process that accounted for all of life’s diversity. Wallace evidently did see, though, and it is a part of Darwin’s appeal that he did not permit his desire for precedence to detract from a thoroughly gentlemanly handling of the competition. Both he and Wallace were generous with the credit they afforded each other.</p> \n<p>So without wishing to presume, I offer a few humble suggestions to Disney that might stave off ridicule from scientists and historians:</p> \n<p>1. Don’t give us a scene in which the young Darwin, observing nature with a keen eye, suddenly becomes slack-jawed as he realises that random mutation and natural selection can explain the apparent “design” in nature that adapts organisms to their environment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a43b1cdbdec97ceed41a5eb273d12f99bdd180e9\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a43b1cdbdec97ceed41a5eb273d12f99bdd180e9/0_70_4214_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four or the species of finch observed by Darwin on the Galapagos Islands\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The myth of the Gal&aacute;pagos finches.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>2. If we have to have such a scene, please let it not involve the Gal&aacute;pagos finches. The adaptation of their beaks to fit different dietary niches was not, contrary to myth, the cornerstone of Darwin’s theory. He never really grasped their significance, and didn’t mention them at all in The Origin of Species.</p> \n<p>3. Don’t show Darwin writing his Origin in a frenzied attempt to beat Wallace into print. There was no such race.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d29da572158184818286af049e6d20e5803ad69a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d29da572158184818286af049e6d20e5803ad69a/0_896_3636_2181/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alfred Russel Wallace\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alfred Russel Wallace – no race.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Classic Image/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>4. Don’t show Darwin’s peers applauding, gasping or protesting as his and Wallace’s papers outlining the theory of evolution by natural selection are read out to the Linnean Society in 1858. The papers were in fact all but ignored at the time – as major scientific discoveries so often are.</p> \n<p>5. Don’t show priests and pastors foaming at the mouth at Darwin’s deconstruction of a nature-designing God, or at the notion that humans are descended from apes. Like the scientists, they mostly received the new theory with indifference at first; the Church of England had more pressing internal disputes on its hands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a5bb57a959bdc2061d124a896ac5d0aded3639c3\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a5bb57a959bdc2061d124a896ac5d0aded3639c3/218_71_2330_1397/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of Emma, wife of Charles Darwin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darwin’s wife Emma – he was more concerned about barnacles.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>6. Don’t show Darwin fretting about whether he should publish through fear of upsetting the church, or his devout wife Emma. He delayed partly because he worried whether he had enough evidence to make his case, but also because he was a very busy man, concerned in particular to finish his great treatise on barnacles.</p> \n<p>The list could go on – it’s not clear, for example, that the death of Darwin’s daughter Annie was central to his loss of Christian faith. But now I’m starting to worry for Disney, faced with the life of a man so often misunderstood, whose greatest joy was to sit at his desk writing about barnacles, earthworms and orchids. They might just need those pirates after all.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6dc6c0026948e41c275d47a7131f83e025b14e43/0_0_2500_1500/2500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1500,"width":2500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AFP/Getty Images","altText":"A copy of Darwin’s book the Origin of Species is pictured in front of a lifesize stone bust of the naturalist","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a43b1cdbdec97ceed41a5eb273d12f99bdd180e9/0_70_4214_2529/4214.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2529,"width":4214,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The myth of the Galápagos finches.

Literally, in the studio with James May and Richard Hammond. It’s a model, not an actual living elephant, though I bet they tried to get one of them. But funny all the same. Would a mammoth – woollier, more extinct – have been better? Though that’s not really the expression is it, the woolly mammoth in the studio …</p> \n<p>It’s not a normal Top Gear episode, this last in the Clarkson-Hammond-May era, but a couple of films that had already been shot, pre steak-gate. With you-know-who himself then. The first is about classic cars: they each have one, an MGB, a Fiat 124 Spider and a Peugeot 304 Decapotable. </p> \n<p>Off they set, on a classic-car adventure, mainly an overextended joke about classic cars being crap and breaking down a lot.

Oh dear, Jeremy has a plate of food in his garage – let’s hope it’s hot, for the sake of whoever provided it. (Oisin Tymon, the producer he punched, gets a credit, incidentally – that’s nice.)</p> \n<p>Emerging in spring, they compare their newly pimped rides. One has a stretchy plastic protective cover over the steering wheel, “a condom for the steering wheel”, Jeremy calls it. James does a better joke: “If you’re a monk, with hair round the sides but not on top, it’s also a shower cap,” he says, demonstrating. Jeremy laughs, generously. I laugh, begrudgingly. It’s a problem for the woolly liberal Guardian disapprover (as opposed to the woolly mammoth): sometimes you can’t help yourself, it is funny.</p> \n<p>The camaraderie between the three seems – has always seemed – genuine. It is the steel chassis upon which the show was built (and which will have to be built again, though Chris Evans is also good at posse-forming). I’m not buying the spontaneity, though. It’s blatantly rehearsed, scripted banality – Top Gear invented the genre. And then got rather good at it. It’s clever stupid telly.</p> \n<p>To an airshow, and Hammond (I’ll never be on first-name terms with that one) has won. Won what? It doesn’t matter; everything is a competition, and a race. His prize is be strapped to the wing of a stunt aeroplane and thrown, screaming, about the sky – hahahaha, proper belly laugh this time.</p> \n<p>Then it’s back on the road for more arsing about, in old 4x4s this time. Jeremy inevitably runs over some bicycles, which mercifully happen to be riderless, and he’s mildly offensive to Turkey. Hammond likes his Jeep. “It’s brilliant, I’ve got wood,” he says, with a pause, before pointing at the dashboard and adding “here”, so he can pretend he wasn’t referencing the Hammond organ. Tee hee, he did a pre-watershed willy joke – but it wasn’t supposed to be, honest, Mr Hall. Like the number plate in Argentina, H982 FKL, which had nothing to with the 1982 FKLands war.<br /></p> \n<p>They trash their cars, roll them off cliffs, cut them in half, as they have done so many times before. And actually, although this wasn’t the way they expected or chose for it to end, there is something apt about it. These loud, ageing, dented, inappropriate, particle-farting gas-guzzlers may have no place on – or off – the road today, but they actually perform resiliently and rather brilliantly, right to the very end. And you could say the same about the cars, boom-boom.</p> \n<p>Hammond loses this time, has to give a speech to the Carbon and Sustainability Trust. Ha, also funny – the idea, more so than the execution. The ideas, the humour, the chutzpah, for which executive producer Andy Wilman (along with Clarkson) must take the credit/blame, are hard to argue with. We can boo the puerility – and worse – of the presenters, plus the laddishness, the message etc, but this Top Gear has often been imaginative, original, entertaining, amusing and artfully made television.</p> \n<p>That’s it then. The future is ginger; while Jeremy, James, Hammond and Andy are taken away to be crushed (imagine that, a Clarkson cube!).

He soon recovers, with fans offering a helping hand.</p> \n<p>The mishap happened as Lil’ Kim, Mase, Faith Evans, 112 and the Lox joined Diddy to perform a medley of past hits. A video montage of rap king Notorious BIG played in the background as his verse from Mo Money Mo Problems played.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, awards co-host Anthony Anderson brought on the laughs when he dressed as singer Sam Smith, who won best new artist but didn’t attend the awards show.</p> \n<p>Anderson sported a suit similar to Smith’s taste and rocked a wig that mirrored the British singer’s hairstyle.</p> \n<p>“Sam Smith isn’t here tonight because he’s white and he didn’t think he would win at the BET Awards,” Anderson said as the audience at the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles burst into laughter. “He didn’t think he could win. But we showed him that we love him, too.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JarettSays/statuses/615330117129240576\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Lil Kim rising like a phoenix, on a loop, forever <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/BETAwards2015?src=hash\">#BETAwards2015</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/IRUOd5yDTp\">pic.twitter.com/IRUOd5yDTp</a></p>— Jarett Wieselman (@JarettSays) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JarettSays/status/615330117129240576\">June 29, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>“This award is going to stay with me for you not showing up to BET,” Anderson sang, referencing Smith’s ubiquitous hit Stay With Me.</p> \n<p>The show Sunday brought a mix of funny and serious moments. Rapping on top of a police car with a large American flag waving behind him, hip-hop prince Kendrick Lamar kicked off the BET awards with a dose of seriousness, but also brought a fiery energy thanks to his charisma and his song’s beat.</p> \n<p>Members in the audience rapped along to Alright, while background dancers danced in the aisles and others onstage wore black and waved the American flag behind Lamar. He later won best male hip-hop artist.</p> \n<p>“This is for Compton, this is for Watts,” the Los Angeles-born rapper said.</p> \n<p>Janelle Monae and Jidenna also brought a serious vibe to the stage when they performed Classic Man: The singers and their background dancers wore large “I’m a Classic Man” signs around their necks, a reference to the historic “I Am a Man” civil rights era protest signs.</p> \n<p>Anderson and fellow “Black-ish” actor Tracee Ellis Ross followed Lamar’s performance with a song poking fun at pop culture, including Robin Thicke’s Blurred Lines case, Pharrell’s signature hat and Rachel Dolezal, the former president of the Spokane chapter of the NAACP.</p> \n<p>“Is white really the new black,” Anderson sang as two photos of Dolezal – one old, the other recent – appeared on screen.</p> \n<p>Rihanna was among the A-listers who sat in the audience, and she sang along during Omarion and Chris Brown’s performance of the pop hit, Post to Be. Alicia Keys surprised the audience when she joined The Weeknd to sing his hit, Earned It.</p> \n<p>Smokey Robinson received the Lifetime Achievement Award, performed a medley of his hits and earned a standing ovation from the audience when he spoke about Hollywood and humility. Ne-Yo, Thicke and rising singer Tori Kelly paid tribute to the icon.</p> \n<p>Nicki Minaj, who won her sixth consecutive best female hip-hop artist award, brought her mother onstage. She gave a shout-out to fellow nominee and rising rapper DeJ Loaf, as well as her rapper-boyfriend Meek Mill, who sat next to her at the show (and she later joined him onstage for his performance).</p> \n<p>“Momma, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for everything you’ve done for me. I love you so much,” she said. “Shout-out to all the girls nominated ... DeJ Loaf ... you’ve been very, very interesting to me and super forward.”</p> \n<p>Terrence Howard, star of the hit Fox series Empire, won the first award for best actor.</p> \n<p>“To the Empire!” he yelled three times. “I got to thank Taraji P Henson because she stood up for a brother.”</p> \n<p>Minaj and Brown, who have won a handful of BET awards over the years, were the top nominees with six each. Brown was nominated twice for video of the year with his hits Loyal and New Flame. Other nominees for the top prize included Minaj’s eye-popping video for Anaconda, Beyonce’s 7/11, Big Sean’s IDFWU and Common and John Legend’s Oscar-winning Glory, from the film Selma.</p> \n<p>The BET Awards is celebrating its 15th anniversary.</p> \n<p><em>Associated Press contributed to this report</em><br /></p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/450ecd1b39a3f73e18f585593844d11ae94c7bf5/494_180_1986_1193/1986.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1193,"width":1986,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP","altText":"Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs performs at the BET Awards at the Microsoft Theater on Sunday.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T03:49:49Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T08:07:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":23,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Diddy","Rap","Hip-hop","Music","Awards and prizes","Culture","US news"],"tags":[{"id":"music/diddy","webTitle":"Diddy"},{"id":"music/rap","webTitle":"Rap"},{"id":"music/hip-hop","webTitle":"Hip-hop"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/awards-and-prizes","webTitle":"Awards and prizes"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/29/bet-awards-2015-diddy-falls-into-hole-on-stage-during-performance","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7yg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jun/29/bet-awards-2015-diddy-falls-into-hole-on-stage-during-performance","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/29/bet-awards-2015-diddy-falls-into-hole-on-stage-during-performance"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457299347","source":"YouTube","durationInSeconds":33,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/29/150629DiddyFall.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/29/150629DiddyFall_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/29/1435562663574/KP_327230_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for P Diddy falls through stage during show in Los Angeles -

Her first hit, boosted by its inclusion on the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVSw5H0MkpY\"><em>Play Misty for Me</em></a> soundtrack, was a Grammy-winning version of Ewan MacColl’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Go9aks4aujM\">The First Time Ever I Saw Your Face</a>. She won a second Grammy in 1974 for her version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1eOsMc2Fgg\">Killing Me Softly With His Song</a>, which was successfully covered two decades later by hip-hop act <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKOtzIo-uYw\">the Fugees</a>. Her most recent album is <em>Let It Be Roberta</em>, a collection of Beatles covers, and she joins Dionne Warwick, the Drifters and the Supremes’ Mary Wilson for the Legends Live UK tour, 3, 4, 6 October.</p> \n<h2><strong>The song that made me want to sing</strong><br /></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNoxoUX2vqQ\"><strong>Trouble of the World by Mahalia Jackson</strong></a><strong> (1956)</strong></p> \n<p>I grew up in Arlington, Virginia, in a place that the black people referred to as Green Valley. It was not a green valley at all but it was OK. My family was a happy family. My mom played the organ and piano; I had lots of relatives who sang. One artist who inspired me was Mahalia Jackson. I loved her voice. It gave me goosebumps. I didn’t think I could ever sing like that because I had a very slight voice when I was a child, but now I realise that what I was hearing from Mahalia was her experience – as an adult, as a musician. All that comes into play when you perform.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"roberta\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:02oUhPB9IzkQKFgyfmVi4m\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The music I loved to play in church</strong><br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Handel’s Messiah (1741)</strong></p> \n<p>I started classical piano lessons when I was nine. In the church I grew up in, gospel music was not the important thing. I remember playing Handel’s <em>Messiah</em> on the organ for the church choir when I was 13 or 14. We weren’t mindblowers, I’m not trying to suggest that, but it was exciting to have that assignment. Handel was a serious guy – an astute musician and songwriter. He put a lot of work into <em>Messiah</em>, but the reason we like singing “Hallelujah” so much is because it’s easy to remember.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"roberta\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:4lMSx6IwVBLgkzyydyt8S5\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The song that kickstarted my singing career</strong><br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Don’t Take Your Love From Me (written by Henry Nemo and published in 1941)</strong></p> \n<p>When I was 15, I enrolled at Howard University in Washington DC. Every year, they had a freshman talent show at the music school. I was recruited to play piano for a girl from Atlanta, Georgia, who wanted to sing Don’t Take Your Love From Me. She had a lovely voice, but on the day she decided she couldn’t do it, she was too nervous, so the senior music student running the show asked me if I’d like to sing it instead. I said: “Oh, I don’t know” – but I wound up winning the show. I loved that song and I still love it because of that experience.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"roberta\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:4cTjAoEZhiUQgTb2mMoDSv\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The record that makes me want to dance</strong><br /></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHgFs4Oxuc4\"><strong>Money Honey by Clyde McPhatter and the Drifters</strong></a><strong> (1953)</strong></p> \n<p>I was listed in my yearbook as having an affinity for dancing. I loved to dance and this is a song that would get me going. I listened to the Drifters a lot when I was younger – Clyde McPhatter, the lead singer, is a very important name in black music history. But, really, I’d dance to whatever everybody else was dancing to. If other people in my age group liked it, I liked it too, because I was young and easily influenced, as young people are.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"roberta\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:2xSoBcjJX9MlC2WyW5hf3t\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The music I play to relax</strong><br /></h2> \n<p><strong>&Eacute;tudes Op 10, Chopin (1833)</strong></p> \n<p>I wanted to be a Chopin genius when I was younger, just to upset people, but I did not succeed with that effort as much as I thought I would. But when I want to play something to make me feel at ease, I play Chopin’s first &Eacute;tude, which is just beautiful.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"roberta\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:0BGn77fTvSPIbvjbAIz1jq\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The hip-hop record I love</strong><br /></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKOtzIo-uYw\"><strong>Killing Me Softly by the Fugees</strong></a><strong> (1996)</strong></p> \n<p>I love hip-hop. In fact I love music, period. Lauryn Hill recorded Killing Me Softly [with the Fugees] and did an excellent job. She’s a genius musician and so is Wyclef Jean who co-produced it. I’m not going to hold on to that song with my heart and bleed to death while someone else covers it; I’m a music lover who has enough experience and common sense to know that it’s good they recorded it and had a hit. I had a hit with it, too, but I wasn’t the first person who recorded it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"roberta\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:1MAqR81Tz28IIqMJ2KUDAO\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The song I made my own</strong><br /></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-m6Kx0a6QEU\"><strong>In My Life by the Beatles</strong></a><strong> (1965)</strong></p> \n<p>I started finding my voice around the time the Beatles started playing and I bought everything they recorded. I learned all of their songs and taught them to my students in junior high school in Washington DC. What appeals to me about the Beatles is their purity. They weren’t waiting for somebody else to come up with the idea, it just came out of them. They were several steps beyond original. When it came to recording my Beatles covers album in 2012, I had found my own space with their music and was able to interpret their songs in my own way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"roberta\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:track:5d4B8ABRtJVTDvVHYwMqMR\" width=\"300\" height=\"80\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434973176665/Roberta-Flack-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Robert Flack on Killing Me Softly… ‘I’m not going to hold on to that song with my heart and bleed to death while someone else covers it.’ Photograph: Simon Russell/Getty Images","credit":"Simon Russell/Getty Images","altText":"Roberta Flack","cleanCaption":"Robert Flack on Killing Me Softly… ‘I’m not going to hold on to that song with my heart and bleed to death while someone else covers it.’ Photograph: Simon Russell/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T06:00:12Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T06:00:12Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Killian Fox","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/killianfox"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Jazz","Soul","Pop and rock","Music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/jazz","webTitle":"Jazz"},{"id":"music/soul","webTitle":"Soul"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Killian Fox","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/killianfox"}}],"series":{"title":"Soundtrack of my life","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/series/soundtrackofmylife"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/29/roberta-flack-soundtrack-of-my-life-fugees-killing-me-softly","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a2gy","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jun/29/roberta-flack-soundtrack-of-my-life-fugees-killing-me-softly","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/29/roberta-flack-soundtrack-of-my-life-fugees-killing-me-softly"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434973176665/Roberta-Flack-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Robert Flack on Killing Me Softly… ‘I’m not going to hold on to that song with my heart and bleed to death while someone else covers it.’ Photograph: Simon Russell/Getty Images","credit":"Simon Russell/Getty Images","altText":"Roberta Flack","cleanCaption":"Robert Flack on Killing Me Softly… ‘I’m not going to hold on to that song with my heart and bleed to death while someone else covers it.’ Photograph: Simon Russell/Getty Images"}},"importance":1,"kicker":{"title":"Roberta Flack"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434973176665/Roberta-Flack-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Robert Flack on Killing Me Softly… ‘I’m not going to hold on to that song with my heart and bleed to death while someone else covers it.’ Photograph: Simon Russell/Getty Images","credit":"Simon Russell/Getty Images","altText":"Roberta Flack","cleanCaption":"Robert Flack on Killing Me Softly… ‘I’m not going to hold on to that song with my heart and bleed to death while someone else covers it.’ Photograph: Simon Russell/Getty Images"}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-06-29T08:11:17Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/6aefcaf1-dbec-4058-a7b8-a925d4163831","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/6aefcaf1-dbec-4058-a7b8-a925d4163831"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"front"}
