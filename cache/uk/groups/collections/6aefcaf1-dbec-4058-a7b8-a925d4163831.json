frustration for the fourteen-time major winner, but an entirely predicable one</p>","byline":"Ewan Murray at Chambers Bay","body":"<p>For Tiger Woods, the saddest aspect of an opening round of 80 at the US Open is the lack of eyebrows that will be raised on account of it. </p> \n<p>The chapters of ignominy keep on flowing for a player who had carded just one professional round of 80 or more from a total of 1,107 between 1996 and 2014. This year, he has trebled that number.</p> \n<p>Fifteen years to the day since Woods won the US Open by 15 shots, he topped a three-wood from the middle of the 18th fairway at Chambers Bay into the deepest bunker on the course. Already nine over par, his hopes of breaking 80 suddenly vanished. He has rarely looked so dejected, so beaten, so incapable of the rousing return for which many golfing fans long. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/henrik-stenson-dustin-johnson-us-open\">Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson rise above mishaps to lead US Open</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This has become painful viewing, which leaves onlookers to wonder just how Woods truly feels about his sharp demise. For all he has been adamant that more competitive play is the key to improved performance, the 14-time major winner is suffering embarrassment after embarrassment in front of the watching world. Cole Hammer, a 15-year-old amateur, outscored Woods by three here. </p> \n<p>After what seems an inevitable missed cut on the outskirts of Seattle, it would be no real surprise if Woods opts to take another break from tournament play. Despite his positive comment to the contrary, there is no evidence whatsoever that Woods can threaten, let alone dominate, leaderboards. Woods has more rounds in the 80s during this season than the 60s. Some form of reassessment is required. </p> \n<p>Prior to Thursday, his highest-scoring single US Open round was 77; that was as an amateur in 1996. Chambers Bay witnessed the fourth highest round of Woods’s professional career. To his credit, and in a departure from what plenty others would do in the same lamentable scenario, a sanguine Woods faced the media thereafter. He had just produced a back nine of 41. </p> \n<p>“I’m not very happy, that’s for sure,” said the 39-year-old. “It was a tough day. I got off to a bad start and then just couldn’t quite get it turned around.</p> \n<p>“It’s one of those things, just got to work through it. I’m trying as hard as I can to do it, and for some reason I just can’t get the consistency that I’d like to have out there.</p> \n<p>“I fought, I fought hard. And that was my number. I couldn’t grind out any harder than that. So that’s just the way I played and unfortunately it was a high number today.”</p> \n<p>Woods admitted this is as challenging a period as he has ever encountered. His solution? “Keep working. Keep grinding and keep working.”</p> \n<p>The 13th hole at Chambers Bay has the widest fairway in US Open history; Woods missed it. He triple bogeyed the 14th. Earlier, at the 8th, his club flew into the air from his hands as he played from wild rough. The 16th witnessed his solitary birdie. </p> \n<p>There was also a smile. If Woods’s score wasn’t a shock, the 81 of Rickie Fowler, one of his playing partners, certainly was. “The bright side is, at least I kicked Rickie’s butt today,” Woods said. That sense of humour has never been more necessary. </p> \n<p>Fowler has been the model of recent major championship consistency and was many people’s tip to claim this event. Barring something astonishing, he won’t survive for the weekend. Only one player, a club professional named Rich Berberian, scored worse on day one than Fowler.</p> \n<p>Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson shared the lead at five under par 65. Patrick Reed lies a shot adrift.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/82b691e5dc926d147a3df7473be9d4d868a07ed1/0_108_4928_2957/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2957,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Harry How/Getty Images","altText":"A frustrating day at the office for Tiger Woods","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Harry How/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T03:54:11Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T08:08:40Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":84,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewan Murray","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/26/1401131130466/Ewan-Murray-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewanmurray"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["US Open Golf 2015","US Open","PGA Tour","US sports","Golf","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/us-open-golf-2015","webTitle":"US Open Golf 2015"},{"id":"sport/usopengolf","webTitle":"US Open"},{"id":"sport/pga-tour","webTitle":"PGA Tour"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/golf","webTitle":"Golf"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ewan Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ewanmurray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/us-open-day-one-tiger-woods","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avk7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/19/us-open-day-one-tiger-woods","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/19/us-open-day-one-tiger-woods"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/82b691e5dc926d147a3df7473be9d4d868a07ed1/0_108_4928_2957/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2957,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tiger Woods reacts to a shot from the rough on the eighth hole during the first round of the 115th U.S. Open Championship at Chambers Bay.

How did one colour come to mean so much? | Hannah Pool</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At this point, I might lean forward, and in whispered tones for effect, share what I call the “crazy rig conversations”.</p> \n<p>“There was this one guy, right – he was just straight out about it,” I say. “He was like, ‘I’m a chauvinist, OK? I’m the last of a dying breed. Let me just say what I want to say!’</p> \n<p>“I’ll tell ya, some of the rest is unrepeatable in good company! Get a bunch of blokes together and anything goes. I reckon I don’t even hear all the good stuff, although they do eventually get used to you.”</p> \n<p>Truth be told, however, that is not the whole picture. In fact, like anything, working as a female in a male-dominated industry is all of the things – challenging, difficult, fun, rewarding, unexpected and above all, completely subjective.</p> \n<p>What is fascinating is how the experience of women in industry reflects the broader expectations of and attitude towards women in our society. There is a general acceptance that gender diversity is a “good” thing, but some occasional reluctance about “forcing” a change, particularly when affirmative action is considered.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Are women the homemakers and the breadwinners? Are men the homemakers?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The broader questions around roles of men and women in society also linger. The traditional norm of men as the breadwinners and women as the homemakers in our society has definitely been challenged, but what does the alternative look like? Are women the homemakers <em>and</em> the breadwinners? Are men the homemakers? What does this say about our construction of masculinity and femininity? There are more questions than there are answers, and being in an industry with mostly men, it is fascinating to see the dynamics play out.</p> \n<p>There are generational differences in the ideologies and this also varies based on industry, location (in the field or in the office) and education level (management versus engineers versus operators). Interestingly, it doesn’t play out like you would expect.</p> \n<p>A recent conversation with a young engineer who started in the mining industry brought this to the fore.</p> \n<p>“I’ve had a great time!” she said, almost in surprise. “I was expecting it to be rough and the men to be mean, but they’ve all taken care of me and shown me around.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, quite often there can be advantages to being a woman in a male-dominated industry. People know who you are, you will always be remembered (which is a double edged sword) and the lads, particularly the operators, enjoy talking to a woman, particularly after being around only blokes for weeks on end. The older generations of men in the field (the baby boomers) are often happy to take on the role of “teacher” for a younger female, so a lot can be learnt. The younger men (gen Y) have grown up in a world where they have been told men and women are generally equal, and accept that as the status quo.</p> \n<p>However, as we see in other industries, those benefits don’t necessarily trickle up, and there are still some structural and societal barriers that make it difficult for women. Scratching beneath the surface allows the unconscious bias to become evident. Taking the case of engineers, for example, it can be argued that female engineers are often highly visible as women, but invisible as engineers. There is an acceptance in equality but not always a true belief in it.</p> \n<p>It may be the baby boomer is happy to teach but finds it difficult to accept direction from a younger female until she has proven her worth beyond all doubt. It may be the residual resentment in the young male engineers that a female engineer is more sought after by a company with a diversity policy. Those biases are more difficult to challenge and reflect the broader societal attitudes that are yet to change.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"dce7967c5e5edc63f6e54ca60cfd57d95d6e6b5e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/dce7967c5e5edc63f6e54ca60cfd57d95d6e6b5e/27_0_513_619/414.jpg\" alt=\"Yassmin Abdel-Magied: life on an oil rig\" width=\"414\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yassmin Abdel-Magied: life on an oil rig</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: yassmin_a/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some of the structural barriers are simply due to the nature of the industry which has been designed around men, due to its history. Whether that is because it’s seen as difficult to hold down a Fifo roster while pregnant or with young children, or that many time-consuming and demanding project management roles are given to engineers at a time when many women are having kids and may not necessarily have the support at home, some male-dominated workplaces are, unsurprisingly, still designed around men. </p> \n<p>It is not all doom and gloom however. Times are changing, and are changing more rapidly than ever. </p> \n<p>There are more and more examples of “non-traditional” families, where duties are shared and unusual support networks created. There are more women entering the science, technology, engineering and maths spaces, although there should be more. There are more companies with obvious diversity policies and that encourage women and cater to their needs. Things are looking up, it just takes time.</p> \n<p>Overall, when it comes to women in male-dominated workplaces, the legislative change has been made. That battle has been won.

Francesco Totti’s company apparently receives almost twice market rate for dilapidated office block on outskirts of Rome</p>","byline":"John Hooper in Rome","body":"<p>A company owned by one of Europe’s most popular footballers has made more than €500,000 from renting a run-down office building to Rome city council as housing for homeless people.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Under the terms of the deal, the council is paying a firm owned by the Italian superstar Francesco Totti almost twice the going market rate. The arrangement was approved by an acquaintance of Totti who is to go on trial this year on unrelated charges of corruption.</p> \n<p>Luca Odevaine, a senior local authority official, is accused of being a pivotal figure in a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/07/june-29-co-operative-italy-rome\">web of corrupt links </a>between the Rome council and an organised crime syndicate headed by a former neo-fascist gunman.</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion the deal between Totti’s firm and the council is illegal. And, since the footballer does not wield executive powers in the company, he may have been unaware of the contents of the agreement when it was signed. But several factors have made it intensely controversial.</p> \n<p>The origins of the affair go back to 2005 when the council approved the creation of a network of temporary housing assistance centres.</p> \n<p>Documents reproduced in a recently published book, I re di Roma (the king of Rome), by Lirio Abbate and Marco Lillo, show that two years later Odevaine was made chairman of a committee tasked with deciding on offers of suitable buildings for the scheme.</p> \n<p>Totti and the official already knew one another. When Odevaine’s father died in 2005, Totti, his wife and his personal trainer and assistant put their names to a notice in the daily L’Unita expressing their condolences.</p> \n<p>Among the offers Odevaine’s committee received was one from Immobiliare Dieci, part of a chain of companies controlled by Totti and all bearing names that refer to the No 10 shirt he wears on the field. His firm proposed the upper storeys of a converted office block in Tor Tre Teste, a dormitory suburb on the desolate outskirts of Rome, and proposed an annual rent of almost €1.3m (&pound;930,000).</p> \n<p>The building has 35 apartments covering 2,430 square metres, so the suggested rent was equivalent to almost €44 per square metre per month. The committee replied that it would pay €15 per square metre per month in rent. With VAT and a recent 6% increase, the total comes to more than €19 per square metre per month.</p> \n<p>Yet, according to the specialist property website <a href=\"http://www.immobiliare.it/prezzi-mq/Lazio/Roma.html?fkContratto=2\">Immobiliare.it</a>, rents in the 00155 post code area in which the building is situated are among the lowest in Rome at around €10 per square metre per month. In fact, the only parts of the capital where rents exceed €19 are in the city’s historic centre. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.immobiliare.it/prezzi-mq/Lazio/CAP_00184-Roma\">website’s estimates</a> suggest the council could put the homeless into accommodation overlooking the Colosseum for much the same rent it is handing over to Totti’s company.</p> \n<p>In addition to the rent, the local authority is paying more than €350,000 a year for services including taking care of the common areas, 24-hour porterage, maintenance and the cleaning of apartments when there is a change of tenant.</p> \n<p>But Elisa Ferri, who lives in the building with her husband and three children, says conditions are frequently squalid. “A pipe burst in the floor above and it took more than a month to get a plumber to come round,” she said. In the meantime, paint had peeled off the ceiling, water dripped on to her children’s beds and mould formed in several areas.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year, the 33-year-old <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://tv.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2015/03/07/residence-topaia-di-totti-inquilini-contratto-milionario-per-vivere-in-tugurio/346566/\">showed the damage to a video reporter</a> from the newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano. </p> \n<p>Ferri, who said she earned €700 a month as a cleaner and carer, told the Guardian the office block was never intended to be inhabited around the clock and that it was plagued by cockroaches. “We have asked several times for disinfestation, but without getting any response,” she said. “I find the cockroaches more repulsive than the mould.”</p> \n<p>The Roma captain declined to respond to questions put to him by the Guardian through his personal trainer and assistant. In March, he also <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.la7.it/servizio-pubblico/video/il-residence-der-pupone-20-03-2015-150363\">refused to give a response to a reporter</a> from the television programme Servizio Pubblico who asked him about his relationship with Odevaine. A representative said merely: “Totti is a footballer. His professional advisers take care of these things.”</p> \n<p>Prosecutors claim Odevaine received €5,000 a month to procure lucrative public contracts for an organised crime syndicate, which – Italy’s highest court has ruled – used mafia-like methods in its operations. In March, Odevaine voluntarily testified to the prosecutors. Reports based on his lawyer’s account of the closed-door proceedings quoted Odevaine as saying the money was compensation for his role as the gang’s “facilitator” and “problem tackler” in the local authority.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Totti in Rome is untouchable, because Totti is Totti</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Ignazio Marino, mayor of Rome</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> The charismatic Totti, 38, has captained AS Roma continuously since 1998, becoming the most prolific goalscorer in the history of the club. A revered figure in his native city – his nicknames include that of <em>Il re di Roma</em> or “the king of Rome” – he has patronised many good causes. He is a goodwill ambassador for the Italian branch of Unicef.</p> \n<p> When the mayor of the Italian capital, Ignazio Marino, was asked about his council’s dealings with the footballer’s companies in March, he replied: “Totti in Rome is untouchable, because Totti is Totti. I want him to carry on winning and scoring …” </p> \n<p> Ownership of the property has since been transferred to Immobiliare Ten, a wholly owned subsidiary of Immobiliare Dieci, which is in turn owned by a firm called Numberten Srl. Totti has an 83.19% stake in Numberten Srl, with the remaining share divided between Totti’s mother, Fiorella Marrozzini, and his brother, Riccardo, who is also Immobiliare Ten’s chief executive. In the four years to the end of 2014 Immobiliare Ten made after-tax profits of €573,996.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434629909294/d094b4b5-e030-4512-9524-2540b40117d1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Xinhua /Barcroft Media","altText":"Francesco Totti of AS Roma and his wife Ilary Blasi.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Xinhua /Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T03:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T03:54:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"John Hooper","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/johnhooper"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Italy","Football","Europe","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/italy","webTitle":"Italy"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"John Hooper","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/johnhooper"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/football-star-flats-homeless-housing-francesco-totti-rome","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49jf2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/19/football-star-flats-homeless-housing-francesco-totti-rome","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/football-star-flats-homeless-housing-francesco-totti-rome"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434629909294/d094b4b5-e030-4512-9524-2540b40117d1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Francesco Totti, captain of AS Roma, and his wife Ilary Blasi.

It is likely to be 2016 at the earliest. </p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434640344014/65609e23-0a76-4bf6-bdc8-aa87a5f70a6f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Juice Images / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"woman at laptop","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Juice Images / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T06:00:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T06:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":56,"contributors":[{"name":"Miles Brignall","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/milesbrignall"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Online shopping","Consumer affairs","Money","Consumer rights","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"money/online-shopping","webTitle":"Online shopping"},{"id":"money/consumer-affairs","webTitle":"Consumer affairs"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"money/consumer-rights-money","webTitle":"Consumer rights"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"money"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Miles Brignall","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/milesbrignall"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"money"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/jun/19/competition-regulator-to-probe-fake-online-reviews","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4av7v","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/money/2015/jun/19/competition-regulator-to-probe-fake-online-reviews","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/19/competition-regulator-to-probe-fake-online-reviews"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434640344014/65609e23-0a76-4bf6-bdc8-aa87a5f70a6f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Competition and Markets Authority says reviews influence the majority of people when they shop online.
