She is here. Don’t let them tell you that this doesn’t work.

She praised Live Aid for changing “the lives of many of my sisters and brothers” in Ethiopia, particularly during the famine. </p> \n<p>But she added: “For me, personally, Live Aid has done nothing. I am branded as the symbol of Live Aid due to the image of the 1980s. My stories are well documented and have reached the skies. But I live underground. The state I am in at this moment is miserable. I do not have a job and I cannot support my family on my own.”</p> \n<p>Woldu explained that she had been hired as a nurse for 10 months soon after graduating from the private <a href=\"http://www.suc.edu.et/index.html\">Sheba University College</a> in the city of Mekelle, Tigray, but had been jobless since. She married at 28 but has since separated and lives in a one-room house with her two daughters. “[People] question how it is I am not able to support my family,” she said. </p> \n<p>Woldu explained she now receives support from the UK-based <a href=\"http://www.a-cet.org.uk/\">African Children’s Educational Trust</a> (ACET). According to ACET she received half of the advance of a book about her life, Feed the World: Birhan Woldu and Live Aid, 10 years ago, and has received money from media interviews. ACET, which has worked in the country for more than 20 years, has built 10 elementary schools in Ethiopia, partly funded by Live Aid and other NGOs.</p> \n<p> “They help many people like me who have no one to support them,” she said. “They pay for children’s school fees and provide monthly stipends.” She added that she now wants to get a job and raise her daughters. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/gallery/2015/may/29/daily-life-in-ethiopia-in-pictures\">Daily life in Ethiopia – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Woldu is positive about <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/oct/22/-sp-ethiopia-30-years-famine-human-rights\">change in her country since the famine </a>of 1983-85, which took the lives of her mother and sister, sparing only her and her father. “The country has come a very long way since then,” she said. “We now have schools and hospitals and road access to remote areas. Mothers no longer endanger their lives by delivering babies in their homes. They can go to a hospital. Things are very good now.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>While she congratulated Live Aid on its 30-year anniversary, saying many felt grateful and indebted to the work it had done, she felt the organisation could help further: “As an aid agency, I believe they could do more in terms of building schools and hospitals. I encourage them to do more in that regard. That way we can be able to transform our country and offer a better life for our children.”</p> \n<p>Giving aid in the form of food and stipends was not the way to bring about sustained change, she added. “Building infrastructure like schools and hospitals or factories that can hire a lot of people will make a big difference.” Food aid would only “make people even more dependent for all their lives … but if people get education and get jobs, they can transform their lives and their country.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7652dada86c9a4f46ba2ea8139ef47ec8f79bdc5/0_219_3157_1894/3157.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1894,"width":3157,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Paul Barker/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Birhan Woldu with Sir Bob Geldof","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Paul Barker/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436706327869/ea828076-b0a3-4d87-9957-ea183c612a05-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"TV footage of Birhan Woldu as a child in Ethiopia during the famine.

The programme on sale at Live Aid called the event a “global jukebox”. </p> \n<p>At its most effective, this is exactly what it was. No one puts money in a jukebox with the intention of playing a record they’ve never heard before, and the cleverest artists who performed that day realised this was no time to shift new product.</p> \n<p> Given one song early in the day to rescue his flagging fortunes, Adam Ant sang his next single Vive Le Rock and effectively signed his own death warrant. Bryan Ferry was similarly short-sighted, choosing to perform three songs out of his allotted four from his new Boys &amp; Girls album (the other was his cover of Jealous Guy) over his most fondly remembered Roxy Music hits. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2dbdb6eeb83aa5284bb8f969197ce7f2c15027a6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436549139737/a03bd76a-8835-41bb-8fdb-5e19a72d7346-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Judicious choice of material ensured the albums of Freddie Mercury and Queen were topsellers after Live Aid.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judicious choice of material ensured the albums of Freddie Mercury and Queen were topsellers after Live Aid.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Dent/Redferns</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And, of course, at the other extreme, no one played it smarter than Queen, who somehow managed to crowbar six hits into their 20-minute slot. This was no accident. As their drummer, Roger Taylor, said at the time: “It’ll make a pot of money for a wonderful cause, but make no mistake, we’re doing it for our own glory as well!” </p> \n<p>The following week’s chart positions ratified their new status. Queen’s Greatest Hits, The Works and Mercury’s solo album Mr Bad Guy soared up the charts; the following summer they returned to Wembley for a headlining show of their own.</p> \n<p>Before Live Aid, they wouldn’t have dared presume they could fill such a space, but the events of 13 July ushered in a new kind of mega-rock event in which there appeared to be no losers: television coverage helped drive sales; a generation of music fans raised on canonical rock artists had the disposable income to spend on these happenings; and the bands, benefiting from the extra coverage, got more and more popular. Ensuing shows by Simple Minds, Genesis, The Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd and U2 meant Wembley was being used almost as much for music as it was for sport. </p> \n<p>By helping create a new superleague of rock stars, an event conceived purely to raise money for African famine victims ended up generating just as much revenue for the labels to whom the artists were signed. From the industry’s perspective, the timing was perfect. Compact disc players were becoming affordable and the format gave baby boomers the perfect excuse to forego new music in order to re-purchase albums by many of the artists who performed that day. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The music industry has been desperate to relive Live Aid - a major live pop event that reinforces the status of artists</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>With this in mind, it’s no surprise that, in the intervening years, the music industry has been desperate to relive Live Aid – a major live pop event, usually charitable, that reinforces the status of established artists and anoints a handful of new ones. Nelson Mandela’s 70th birthday, Freddie Mercury’s tribute concert, Live 8, Live Earth, Concert for Diana are all cases in point.</p> \n<p>At the age of 60, rock’n’roll finds itself in a strange position. What was once countercultural has now inevitably become the status quo. No fixture on the calendar represents that delicate transition quite like Glastonbury. The festival which, according to the editor of Roots magazine and inaugural attendee, Ian Anderson, started out as “just one stage, a bunch of hippies, with free milk handed out from the farm”, now caters to two audiences. Up in the Green Fields, it’s much the same as it always was: dozens of stages play host to troupes of bearded self-styled self-sustaining artists playing music whose commercial potential is as negligible as it was 40 years ago. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1423b6bf8a2e404463f8d46f3d9adb808bdc3591\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436549701134/53076514-ea93-4295-834d-9da66da77af8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lionel Richie performs to crowds at Glastonbury and, thanks to the BBC, into the living rooms of middle England.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Richie performs to crowds at Glastonbury and, thanks to the BBC, into the living rooms of middle England.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yui Mok/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On the main stage, where the BBC cameras are trained, it’s a different story.

Live Aid reached 1.9 billion people across 150 countries, and raised &pound;40m.</p> \n<p>Geldof was, in a sense, the pioneer of a new breed of celebrity “missionaries” with his efforts to end the Ethiopian famine. Yet, as American journalist <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2005/jun/24/g8.debtrelief\">David Rieff has noted</a>, Live Aid’s donations to NGOs such as Oxfam and Save the Children also facilitated the displacement of 600,000 people by the autocratic Mengistu regime, resulting in an estimated 100,000 deaths.</p> \n<p>Three decades after Live Aid, it is clear that celebrity efforts to “save Africa” have often done more to reinforce negative media stereotypes about the “dark continent” and to portray its one billion citizens as helpless victims in a new “white man’s burden”. The Economist, for example, depicted Africa as a “hopeless continent” in 2000, with its then Africa editor, Richard Dowden, penning an equally prejudiced cover story. </p> \n<p>Often naive celebrities have burnished their own reputations as new missionaries of a troubled age: Geldof and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2013/sep/22/bono-campaigner-u2-global-poverty\">Bono</a> are seeking to “end poverty”, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-george-cloony-darfur-what-next\">George Clooney is “saving” Darfur</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2009/jun/12/madonna-mercy-malawi\">Madonna has adopted children in Malawi</a> as if buying new pets, while Prince Harry is on his way to Namibia to “save” the black rhino. </p> \n<p>This cult of celebrity has often led to a dangerous dumbing down of serious issues, brushing aside other innovative and resilient grassroots efforts.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>This cult of celebrity has often led to a dangerous dumbing down of serious issues</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> At the 2005 G8 industrialised countries summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, during which Geldof and Bono organised the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/live8\">Live 8</a> concert, there was an almost Alice in Wonderland expectation that this club of eight rich men would be swayed by the tuneful ballads of musicians into “saving” Africa. The G8’s promises of eliminating agricultural export subsidies, doubling aid to Africa, and writing off debt, largely remain unfulfilled a decade later.</p> \n<p>Geldof recently declared Gleneagles had “helped pave the way for a new world order”. This fanciful claim, however, clearly belongs more in the realm of fairytale.

Long-running conflicts in Angola, Ethiopia, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been calmed; civil society activists have courageously fought for democratic freedoms in Benin, Zambia, Egypt, Tunisia and Burkina Faso; ruling parties have been voted out of office in Ghana, Senegal, Ivory Coast, Kenya and Nigeria; and members of Africa’s diaspora now contribute $60bn ($40m) annually to their home countries: more than the continent receives in foreign aid. </p> \n<p>Africa certainly needs partners in a globalised world, but it may be time to light a bonfire of vanities for the celebrity-missionaries who seek to save us from ourselves.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>Dr Adekeye Adebajo is executive director of the Centre for Conflict Resolution, Cape Town, South Africa<br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Development","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c613a4220654330cd67d01a3a54fc3c1e4476b0c/0_119_2693_1616/2693.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1616,"width":2693,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stephen Hird/REUTERS","altText":"Bob Geldof performs at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London, in July 2005","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Stephen Hird/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T06:00:06Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T06:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Adekeye Adebajo","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/adekeye-adebajo"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Global development","Africa","Ethiopia","Bob Geldof","World news","Live Aid","Music","Culture","Band Aid 30","Live 8"],"tags":[{"id":"global-development/global-development","webTitle":"Global development"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"world/ethiopia","webTitle":"Ethiopia"},{"id":"world/bob-geldof","webTitle":"Bob Geldof"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"music/live-aid","webTitle":"Live Aid"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"music/band-aid-30","webTitle":"Band Aid 30"},{"id":"music/live8","webTitle":"Live 8"}],"section":{"id":"global-development"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Adekeye Adebajo","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/adekeye-adebajo"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"global-development"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/commentisfree/2015/jul/13/celebrity-save-africa-stereotypes-bob-geldof-live-aid","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4at74","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/global-development/commentisfree/2015/jul/13/celebrity-save-africa-stereotypes-bob-geldof-live-aid","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/commentisfree/2015/jul/13/celebrity-save-africa-stereotypes-bob-geldof-live-aid"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c613a4220654330cd67d01a3a54fc3c1e4476b0c/0_119_2693_1616/2693.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1616,"width":2693,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bob Geldof performs at the Live 8 concert in Hyde Park, London, in July 2005, timed to coincide with the G8 summit at Gleneagles.

The real problem, however, is that microwave ovens live too long</p>","byline":"Charles Arthur","body":"<p>Visited anyone recently and tried to use their microwave oven? Of all the familiar devices in a house, the microwave has long been the laggard in usability. The “science oven”, as it is so wonderfully described in the 1970s-set film <em>American Hustle</em>, pre-dates the digital era (the first came out in 1967); and the advent of programmes and digital buttons hasn’t helped much since. So when you buy one, or go to someone’s house and use theirs, you will almost certainly be confronted by an unfamiliar interface. How powerful is it? Do I have to set the heat or time first? If I have to press digital buttons to set the heating time, will it interpret them as hours? If I need to set a heating time of more than an hour, do I enter the minutes, or is there an “hour” setting?</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, since the “science oven” came along, we’ve got used to smartphones and tablets whose interfaces have undergone a flurry of interbreeding. Even in rival mobile interfaces, you expect to find apps offered as an array of icons; to have notifications about events in a sliding layer at the top; and get easy access to key functions such as Wi-Fi and Bluetooth from any screen. If microwave interfaces had standardised to the same extent, we’d be able to operate almost any on sight. Instead, they still can’t tell when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIGPvPRzEaQ\" title=\"\">you’ve put metal in them</a>.</p> \n<p>The extent of the variation was pointed out in a 2013 post that recently resurfaced in which blogger <a href=\"http://timandjeni.com/blog/why-do-most-microwaves-have-such-a-terrible-user-interface/\" title=\"\">Timothy Ellis wondered about the awfulness of the interfaces</a>. He looked at an LG model with 31 buttons, and a Jenn-Air one with 34 buttons, “when all I want to do is heat up food for a specified time”. On the Jenn-Air, he noted: “The vast majority of the time, I use exactly two of these buttons: ‘add 30 sec’ (which also starts the heat) and ‘Stop/Cancel’.” So 94% of the buttons are wasting space.</p> \n<p>In some ways, microwave interfaces have gone backwards. Older models had two dials: power and time. They were intuitive: more clockwise, more power/time. Then digital timers arrived, as did tapping a button to enter time, rather than turn a dial. This favoured the cool factor over usability: a dial provides its own feedback and is easily grasped (literally and figuratively) by old and young.</p> \n<p>The infatuation with digital became another part of the problem. A <a href=\"http://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/28006/why-do-microwave-oven-uis-fail\" title=\"\">discussion on Stack Exchange</a> on the topic points to a book by Alan Cooper, who says that if you mix a computer with another thing, the result is still a computer. This leads to “feature creep”: Microsoft Office has a bazillion more options for formatting pages than you want, because someone somewhere might use it occasionally, so things such as <a href=\"http://eng.faq.panasonic.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/10689/~/what-is-chaos-defrost%3F\" title=\"\">chaos defrost</a> become a selling point. In fact, “chaos defrost” can cut defrost time by up to 60%. Our microwave has it. But we bought it based on price and volume, not “features”.</p> \n<p>In the end, I think there’s a simple reason why these interfaces have not merged more rapidly: life-spans. It’s not unusual for these machines to last 10 or 15 years, their interfaces frozen in time, while designers think of smarter ideas. The “30 seconds” top-power button is becoming increasingly common, but it’ll probably be 10 years before you can go into someone’s kitchen and be confident of seeing it on the microwave. Sometimes, even great user interface ideas are held back by simple problems: the products just don’t wear out fast enough for new stuff to come through.</p> \n<p>If you’ve ever complained about your smartphone’s short life, look at it this way – at least you’re not trying to operate it with an interface from 2005.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436200264309/Selection-of-convenience--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Remove the wrapping and simply pop them in the microwave … once you've grasped how it works.

No longer.</p> \n<p>When Novak Djokovic pounded a cross-court winner past Roger Federer on Sunday afternoon to seal his third Wimbledon championship and ninth grand slam title, the four-way hegemony that has long defined the tour never appeared more like a spot in the rear view mirror. There is the Big One, and there is everyone else.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/federer-praises-djokovic-after-final-defeat\">Roger Federer generous in defeat by Novak Djokovic in Wimbledon final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Djokovic had entered the showdown between the top two seeds with an 8-8 record in grand slam finals, lending it a pivotal feel with respect to his legacy despite an extraordinary run of form this season that included a 47-3 match record and five titles. He would have been the world No1 by more than 3,000 rankings points even if he had lost Sunday’s final, but the questions over his mental fortitude that have persisted through the years – never more than after last month’s shock defeat by Stan Wawrinka in the French Open final – would have redoubled.</p> \n<p>Instead Djokovic proved that when he is at his best, there is simply no stopping him. He crunched 46 winners and committed just 16 unforced errors, pounding groundstrokes with metronomic efficiency that pinned Federer to the worn-out baselines through exhausting rallies, punctuating points with winners into the corners and grace notes of deft net play.</p> \n<p>Federer’s only choice was to counter Djokovic’s artillery – weapons-grade forehand, stout defence, superior endurance in the baseline rallies – with variety. The seven-times Wimbledon champion tried it all – varying topspin and slice within the points, blending serve-and-volley with traditional baseline exchanges – with the improvisational flair of a chess grandmaster.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457476148__\n</div> \n<p>The sentimental favourite was never in question despite conditions that fluctuated wildly. The crowd rallied behind the Swiss when he fell behind in his service games and buzzed in anticipation when he staked even the slightest foothold in Djokovic’s. The roar of 15,000 fans exploded when he saved seven set points in a second-set tiebreaker to avoid going two sets down. When he was broken at 2-2 in the fourth set – a sequence that ultimately decided that match – a subdued hush fell over Centre Court as ominous as the grey sky above. Djokovic does not want to be the cowboy in the black hat, but he showed that he will if he must.</p> \n<p>“I expected that coming into the match,” Djokovic said. “I think it’s normal because Roger is a champion on and off the court. He’s a very likeable guy. He’s somebody that’s played on this level for so many years. Not judging by the results, but his character, his personality. He’s done all the right things to get that support. More or less anywhere I play against Roger it’s the same. I have to accept it, and I have to work to earn that support. One day.”</p> \n<p>Whatever doubts lingered over Djokovic’s nerve, it was Federer who looked anxious during the decisive games of the fourth set with a series of uncharacteristic errors while the world No1 rolled through his service games, at one point winning 11 straight points on his serve after holding from 30-0 down in the opening game. When Federer led 30-0 with Djokovic serving at 4-3, the champion piped in a pair of 121mph aces, then closed out the game with a service winner – and one hand on the trophy.</p> \n<p>Posterity may read it as the scalp of a lion in winter, Djokovic bagging a second straight Wimbledon title at the expense of a 33-year-old father of four. But make no mistake, this was vintage-era Federer: the balletic footwork, liquid-whip forehand, effortless serve all working in concert.</p> \n<p>While his stamina has fallen off marginally from his stratospheric peak – as an average first-serve speed that faded over the course of the match would suggest – the legitimate world No2 showed well in his record 10th final at the All England Club. Just not well enough to defeat an opponent who at the moment holds the entire tour in his thrall.</p> \n<p>At 28, Djokovic’s move from the fringe toward the forefront of the debate over who is the greatest ever seems only a matter of time. Who on the horizon stands in his way? Andy Murray, two major titles in hand, is no doubt a worthy rival. But he has won just eight of their 27 meetings, including losing eight in a row since the Scot’s epochal win in the 2013 Wimbledon final.</p> \n<p>Djokovic has performed just as well or better against the next wave – Grigor Dimitrov (five wins, one loss), Kei Nishikori (5-2), Milos Raonic (5-0) – and has yet to lose to the surprise US Open champion Marin Cilic in 13 attempts. Should he remain injury-free, there is no reason he cannot make a serious run at catching up all before him on the all-time major leaderboard: Federer (17), Rafael Nadal (14), Pete Sampras (14), Roy Emerson (12), Rod Laver (11), Bjorn Borg (11) and Bill Tilden (10).</p> \n<p>“I’m 28,” he said. “I feel good. I don’t feel old. I have hopefully many more years in front of me. I’m going to try to push my own limits and see how far I can go really with titles and with myself playing on this high level.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436774033532/21a61bd1-19a5-49c6-82cd-39a172b4230a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins for the Guardian","altText":"Novak Djokovic kisses the trophy after his victory over Roger Federer.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T07:00:14Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T07:54:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":16,"contributors":[{"name":"Bryan Armen Graham","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/bryan-armen-graham"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Novak Djokovic","Wimbledon 2015","Roger Federer","Tennis","Wimbledon","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/novak-djokovic","webTitle":"Novak Djokovic"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/roger-federer","webTitle":"Roger Federer"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Bryan Armen Graham","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/bryan-armen-graham"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457476148","source":"SNTV","durationInSeconds":54,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/13/150713Wimbledon_FromGAus-16x9.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/13/150713Wimbledon_FromGAus/150713Wimbledon_FromGAus.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436749923453/novak-djokovic-001.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":640,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reaction after Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer to win te men's singles final at Wimbledon on Sunday. 13 July 2015 Photograph: SNTV","credit":"SNTV","altText":"novak djokovic","cleanCaption":"Reaction after Novak Djokovic beat Roger Federer to win te men's singles final at Wimbledon on Sunday. 13 July 2015 Photograph: SNTV"}}],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/wimbledon-novak-djokovic-roger-federer-mens-singles-final","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4atbp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/wimbledon-novak-djokovic-roger-federer-mens-singles-final","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/wimbledon-novak-djokovic-roger-federer-mens-singles-final"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436774033532/21a61bd1-19a5-49c6-82cd-39a172b4230a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Novak Djokovic kisses the trophy after his victory over Roger Federer.

Wrong, as BBC3’s new doc carefully shows</p>","byline":"Filipa Jodelka","body":"<p>I think my interest in Big Brother has finally flatlined. By now, and having presented every possible variation of “women with severe personality disorders”, “relatable fatties” and “wacky guys in hats”, the show seems less a slick machine giving people their 15 minutes of fame and more like a compulsory internment camp that all citizens must pass through. It wasn’t always like this, but fairytales don’t exist any more, unless you count the distant chance of winning big on the scratchies and spending your days in a secondhand Lambo, doing doughnuts on the lawns of your enemies shouting “SUCK IT YOU DICKHEADS!” from the window for ever and ever, and Snapchatting the whole thing.</p> \n<p>Jane Park, who won &pound;1,000,000 at the age of 17, is one of the youngest people in the country to become a lottery millionaire. Jane chose to take full advantage of this new and unique opportunity and ticked “yes” on all publicity. And so, after her win, a BBC Scotland crew followed her for a year, the fascinating results of which are now being shown nationwide on BBC3 In <strong>Teenage Millionaire</strong>.</p> \n<p>The best thing about Jane, and there’s a lot to choose from, is that coming from the Niddrie estate in Edinburgh she never once lets fatuous tripe like “money doesn’t buy happiness” leave her gob. Jane knows full well that money buys happiness, because Jane’s No 1 priority – after procuring roughly 97% of Topshop’s inventory, a tiny chihuahua puppy called Princess and an immaculate, new-build house – was sorting her loved ones out. As the year rolls by, this desire is manifested in mountains of Christmas presents and frequent holidays to Spain. Jane is the kind of girl to sort TripAdvisor reviews by their happy hour offers and “OAPs doing Tom Jones on karaoke” ranking. On a birthday trip to Benidorm for mama Park, Jane nonchalantly explains that she isn’t impressed by five-star resorts. “Watching sunsets?” she scoffs, pulling a face like a bulldog having trouble digesting lunch. Whether such behaviour is evidence of her inherent realness or someone trying to retain an important part of her identity, I’ll let you judge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtGIY3y7LQ0\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dtGIY3y7LQ0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Either way, I love Jane for idly sticking two fingers up at the idea of a spa break in Rhodes or other emblems of “sophistication” being the only thing to aspire to. I love her twice as hard for depriving a certain type of viewer of the chaotic chavs-on-tour spectacle they might have been expecting by taking entirely normal holidays and considering sound financial options. The neat conclusion to undeserving wealth, in the British mind, is the newly rich spaffing their money on one too many signet rings and losing everything. There’s a bitter streak running through all of us, so it’s no surprise that the programme is heavy on people muttering things like: “It’s mad isn’t it? Seventeen and winning a million pounds” from the sidelines. (“It’s fucking brilliant,” Jane replies drily.)</p> \n<p>Personally, I’m delighted she got lucky. For a start, she suits the zero-frigs lifestyle to a tee. She takes a job as a Magaluf shot girl in order to make her million go further. But that million also gives her the freedom to observe that the job is “shit”, and quit. Most people, I suspect, would be hard-pressed to conceptualise what a million quid truly is. Jane, though, is clever enough to know that the figure pitches unnervingly between “flipping loads” and “might not last a lifetime”. In a meeting with a financial advisor which has clearly eroded Jane’s abundant natural vitality, she’s told a lot of stuff about investing her remaining money. Stocks and shares, Jane says, have been explained to her thousands of times, but she doesn’t really care to commit to the precise details to memory. She doesn’t care for someone else making her decisions, either; so when she gets bored of reading Pick Me Up in the various rooms of her brand new home, she moves back in with her mum and rents it out for a very tidy monthly sum.</p> \n<p>I think Jane will be all right. Besides, she says: “If I was to spend it all, then YOLO. I don’t care!”</p> \n<p><strong><em>Monday, 9pm, BBC3</em></strong></p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436369162333/Jane-Park-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jane Park.

said the future of the BBC warranted a “proper public debate, not one conducted by a small elite”. Yet just five months later, Fairhead agreed a five-year funding settlement for the BBC that had been hammered out in secret and in the space of less than a week.</p> \n<p>Last Monday’s surprise announcement that the BBC had agreed to pay for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/06/osborne-slashes-bbc-budget-pay-over-75s-tv-licences\">free television licences for people aged over 75</a> has been roundly criticised: the former acting chair of the trust, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/07/bbc-attack-public-future-licence-fee\">Diane Coyle, called it “unconstitutional”</a> and a “massive attack on the BBC’s independence”.</p> \n<p>By last Friday, faced with a firestorm of criticism, Fairhead agreed to her first newspaper interview since starting her controversial tenure last September. Although “unhappy” and “disappointed” about the process, she described the agreement as “a good deal, given the circumstances”.</p> \n<p>These circumstances, which began with a surprise phone call from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/18/john-whittingdale-culture-secretary-bbc-rupert-murdoch\">culture secretary John Whittingdale</a> to both Fairhead and BBC director general Tony Hall on Monday June 29, could have far-reaching consequences for the BBC. In the call, Whittingdale relayed the “government’s decision” that the BBC should take on the &pound;750m burden of the free TV licences. Faced with what looked like a fait accompli, Fairhead says she worked in “close contact” with Hall in the “frenetic” following week “fighting on behalf of licence fee payers to make sure that the mitigations were such that we could create a strong, sustainable BBC in the long term. That is what we did over the course of the week.”</p> \n<p>These “mitigations”, a word Fairhead uses a lot along with “process”, include the government’s offer to modernise the licence fee to include catchup television, phase in the bill for the over-75s over a longer period and, most importantly, its “assurance” that the licence fee will rise in line with inflation.</p> \n<p>The level of uncertainty over the BBC’s claim that the financial impact will be flat, or even a little up, was thrown into relief when Whittingdale suggested that the index link will only kick in “if” the BBC remains the same after the charter review period which ends in December 2016, a point echoed in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/09/bbc-cuts-government-forced-to-publish-licence-fee-deal-letter\">official letters published on Thursday</a>.</p> \n<p>Fairhead denies that the culture secretary is threatening further significant changes to the BBC following the launch of his green paper in the coming week. “I have been assured by the chancellor and the secretary of state that only a very fundamental change in the BBC would change that position,” she says.</p> \n<p>In a statement that perhaps shows the gulf between us more than anything, she says: “The word of a chancellor and a secretary of state you should be able to trust.”</p> \n<p>Although the BBC’s own calculations suggest the deal will eventually be revenue-neutral, the Office for Budgetary Responsibility has said it faces a 20% funding cut over the next five years. Fairhead suggests these forecasts can’t compare “apples and pears” partly because the OBR is discounting the BBC’s “self-help” measures such as cutting costs and increasing revenues outside the licence fee.</p> \n<p>Will the BBC need to make further cuts then? “Nobody should be under any illusion that the BBC is off the hook in terms of efficiency savings,” she says. “The BBC will avoid cutting services as much as possible, but there will be changes in scope.”</p> \n<p>“Scope” is a dreadful charter review word that points to how much the BBC does. Whittingdale has openly expressed doubts over it showing popular entertainment shows such as Strictly Come Dancing, while in her examples of great programming Fairhead singles out sport and children’s television and Brian Cox. So what about Strictly?</p> \n<p>“You don’t want a situation when it’s just market failure,” she says firmly. “You need a range of programmes like Strictly come Dancing.”</p> \n<p>With plans to turn the BBC TV news channel online-only said to be under review, Fairhead’s talk of making the BBC fit for a changing market suggests it may not be the only one. Although unhappy about the process, the trust and Fairhead came to the conclusion that a democratically elected government could choose to switch its subsidies at will. According to this account, the seeds of the problem were sown at the turn of the century when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/1999/nov/10/4\">Labour’s Gordon Brown decided </a>to give the over-75s free TV licences. “The BBC needs to be very wary of accepting any direct government funding in the future unless there are clear protections,” she says.</p> \n<p>Isn’t a government decision to support the elderly with state funds slightly different from dumping huge costs on the BBC, though? “This was a continuation of that trend which I urge ministers to reform,” says Fairhead. “The BBC needs to keep control of its funding. There is a risk of a chilling effect if the government can use licence fee payers’ money to fund government projects.” The lack of clarity of state and licence fee funding was further exacerbated in 2010 when the previous trust and BBC management picked up the bill for the World Service, broadband rollout and S4C, she adds.</p> \n<p>However much she trusts the government, Fairhead, who has previously denied that she is politically active, is calling for change. In its response to the forthcoming green paper, the trust will demand that protections are enshrined in law that prevent any significant raid on licence fee money in future negotiations without public and parliamentary consultation.</p> \n<p>When Osborne tried the same last-minute raid on the licence fee in 2010, the then chair<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2010/oct/20/bbc-trust-licence-fee-spending-review\"> Sir Michael Lyons threatened to resign</a>, prompting Chris Bryant, the shadow culture secretary, to urge Fairhead to do the same on Friday.</p> \n<p>Fairhead, married to a Conservative councillor, calls <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/10/lame-duck-bbc-trust-chair-should-quit-labour-chris-bryant\">the idea of resigning</a> “a total dereliction of duty”. It is the second time a Labour MP has called for her resignation; the first was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/live/2015/mar/09/ed-balls-speech-on-tory-spending-cuts-politics-live-blog\">Margaret Hodge for her position at HSBC</a> during the tax avoidance scandal.</p> \n<p>Bryant also believes she delivered a mortal wound to the BBC Trust and made herself a “lame duck” when in her other public speech she said the trust itself was not fit for purpose. Again, Fairhead rejects the suggestion: “I do not agree that it has weakened the position of the trust because as we’ve seen from this discussion the trust was involved and was representing the views of the licence fee payers.</p> \n<p>“Over charter review we will fight to make sure that the public have a very, very strong voice in the shape and scope of the BBC.”</p> \n<p>Both Fairhead and Whittingdale, when he chaired the culture, media and sport select committee, have backed a unitary board and an external regulator. Would she consider standing for the job?</p> \n<p>“It’s not for me to decide. My role is to get the best possible structure for the BBC to remain independent and strong. The only thing I’m really focused on is getting the right structure for the BBC. This is not about me, it’s about the BBC.”</p> \n<h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> \n<p><strong>Age </strong>54</p> \n<p><strong>Education </strong>Yarm grammar school, Stockton-on-Tees, St Catharine’s College, Cambridge (law)</p> \n<p><strong>Career 1983</strong> associate consultant, Bain &amp; Co <strong>1988</strong> analyst, Morgan Stanley <strong>1989 </strong>manager, Bain &amp; Co<strong> 1991</strong> consultant, British Aerospace <strong>1995</strong> vice-president, UK Aerospace Services <strong>1996</strong> vice-president of strategy, ICI <strong>2001 </strong>deputy director of finance, Pearson <strong>2004</strong> non-executive director, HSBC<strong> 2006 </strong>chief executive, FT Group <strong>2013</strong> chair, BBC Trust</p> \n<p><em>This article was amended on 12 July 2015.

His name was Abu Mohammed, he was 60 years old. I was 15. They told us we were their sex slaves.” The upturned faces of the students at Saltley Academy in Birmingham are shocked into perfect stillness, as 16-year-old Munira, a Yazidi Iraqi, describes how she was kidnapped and repeatedly raped by members of Islamic State.<br /></p> \n<p>As stories of British citizens leaving the UK to join Isis continue to emerge, Saltley – which a year ago found itself engulfed in the “Trojan horse” storm – has taken part in the launch of a new anti-radicalisation campaign that aims to combat the organisation’s propaganda.<br /></p> \n<p>You could have heard a pin drop in the school’s library as a select group of students heard the stories of three young Yazidi women who had travelled from refugee camps they now call home to speak about the reality of life under Isis.<br /></p> \n<p>The women – wearing headscarves in order to protect their identity – had a message for any girl who may be considering the life of a jihadi bride. “I want [young people] not to believe what they see on Facebook,” said 21-year-old Bushra. “There is no life with Daesh [Isis] apart from rape and killing.”<br /></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.openyoureyes.net/\">Open Your Eyes</a> campaign was launched by Birmingham and Bradford-based anti-extremism charity <a href=\"http://www.upstandingneighbourhoods.org/\">Upstanding Neighbourhoods</a> with the support of the <a href=\"http://www.amarfoundation.org/\">Amar Foundation</a>. It aims to take on Isis’ message using the same peer-to-peer social media contact that has been used as such a ruthlessly efficient recruitment tool by the extremist group.<br /></p> \n<p>“You only need to look around to see why their work is needed so urgently,” said Henna Rai from Upstanding Neighbourhoods. “Isis’ propaganda machine is so vast that there needs to be a counter-narrative.”<br /></p> \n<p>Open Your Eyes hopes to recruit 10,000 young people to reach out to those who may be drawn to Isis, as well as providing a platform for victims to tell their own stories.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ba4d9f05d10759deb029b1262ab064e99dcdd8d6\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ba4d9f05d10759deb029b1262ab064e99dcdd8d6/42_209_3621_2173/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former Isis captive.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘There is no life with Daesh apart from rape and killing,’ was the message imparted by one 21-year-old woman, a former Isis captive.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is, says Rai, proof of the efforts being made by members of the Muslim community to combat the Isis message which, she argues, is going largely unappreciated. “The narrative coming out of government is that the community is not doing enough but they haven’t made any effort to find out who is doing what. We are doing what we can to combat extremism and radicalisation but the recognition and the funding just isn’t there.”<br /></p> \n<p>Amena Saeed Hassan, a Yazidi Iraqi MP, who, with the Amar Foundation, helped rescue the girls and bring them to the UK, also emphasises the importance of the work. “Daesh has nothing to do with any religion or morals,” she says. “It carries out evil crimes against innocents, killing the elderly, men, and babies, taking turns in raping girls they hold prisoner hundreds of times a day. Anyone who has any decent morals and manners wouldn’t join Daesh but would instead help in freeing their victims.”</p> \n<p>At Saltley, there is a conspicuous effort to promote “British values”. A large St George’s cross has been imprinted on to the wall of the majority Muslim school with the words: “I’m St George. I’m here to defend: Tolerance, The Rule of Law, Freedom of Expression, Community, Equality, on behalf of everyone.”<br /></p> \n<p>But the school’s new head, Peter Weir, is keen to emphasise that the school’s past has nothing to do with current events. “I didn’t see this as, ‘we have an issue to deal with’,” he says. “I saw it as a great educational opportunity.”<br /></p> \n<p>Saltley hit the headlines in 2013 after its former head, Balwant Bains, resigned, saying he had been forced out by the school’s governors, in a saga that was linked to the so-called Trojan horse affair, an alleged plot to “take over” state schools and run them along strict Islamist lines. The governors later <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2014/jun/20/saltley-school-governors-resign-ofsted-trojan-horse\">resigned en masse in protest</a> at the way they said the school had been treated by Ofsted and Birmingham council.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aabbc5b68319eb0ef9f7c649d283640c39a8c10e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/aabbc5b68319eb0ef9f7c649d283640c39a8c10e/833_0_1855_2782/667.jpg\" alt=\"Speaker from the Open Your Eyes campaign\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Open Your Eyes campaign aims to recruit 10,000 young people and provide a platform for victims to tell their own stories.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Weir now sees part of his role as “myth-busting” at the school, which he says has never had segregated classes, and has always taught sex education, music and art. “My real concern with Trojan horse is the impact it has had on the community,” he says. “We do worry about how people view the areas in which Trojan horse was said to have happened, because I don’t believe it’s a true representation of the community. I think it’s extremely unfortunate.”<br /></p> \n<p>Hearing firsthand the stories of brutality has made pupils at the school more likely to speak out about extremism, says 15-year-old student Zishaan Hussain, who says Isis have “ruined the reputation of Islam and Muslims” and given a false impression of his religion. <br /></p> \n<p>He now wants to help counter the propaganda from the group. “What we’ve seen and heard today is just atrocious,” he says. “It does exactly what they said – it opens your eyes.” <br /></p> \n<h2>Case studies</h2> \n<p><strong>Munira, 16<br /></strong></p> \n<p>Munira was just 15 when she was torn away from her family as Isis fighters invaded her village. “They separated me from my baby sisters, they were only five months and four, and my eight-year-old brother,” she says. “I was devastated, particularly about the baby. I was very sacred, I wanted to die.” She was taken by a much older Isis soldier, a 60-year-old man called Abu Mohammed who kept her imprisoned in a remote house. “However hard I screamed, yelled and cried there was no one to help us. When he raped me he told me ‘you are slaves, you are our slaves of war’.” </p> \n<p>Munira was sold on between men several times, and repeatedly raped. “I was in captivity for three months and 20 days,” she says, eyes downcast. “I used to think I would rather be dead than living through this.” She escaped by jumping out of a second floor window and has been reunited with her parents in a refugee camp. Her younger sisters remain in the hands of Isis. “I am living in the camp now with my family, waiting. There is nowhere else to go. I don’t have hope for anything any more,” she says. “I want my family and all the Yazidis to be taken away now, because this will happen again and again and again unless we move away. No Yazidi can feel safe at all.”</p> \n<p><strong>Bushra, 21</strong></p> \n<p>When Isis tore up Bushra’s village and she and her family fled for the mountains, a young man who had been a friend of her brothers told them to go home and that they would not be hurt. When her brother refused, the man put a gun to his head. Bushra, then 18, was taken to a strange city and held captive with her 14-year-old sister. After being told they were to be married, her friend from the village went into the bathroom and slit her wrists. “They knew I was closest to her; they made me go into the bathroom,” she says. “She was covered in blood and I couldn’t look at her. They wrapped her in a blanket and threw her in the street like a piece of rubbish.” </p> \n<p>Finally, she and her sister were chosen by the same young man who had once been a friend of the family. “I thought it would be better to kill my sister and myself,” she says. “I put a scarf around our necks, but I was too scared. I couldn’t go through with it.” One night, as she was being raped in his house by another soldier, she could hear her sister being raped by the former friend in the next room. “I could hear her screams filling my ears but I couldn’t do anything to help her,” she says. Bushra and her sister escaped; they now live in a refugee camp but nine members of her family are still missing. “I want the whole world to hear our story and do something about it, to help free the Yazidi people who are still held captive,” she says. “I wish they would give us asylum, because we can no longer live in Iraq.”</p> \n<p><strong>Noor, 22</strong></p> \n<p>Noor was 18 when Isis came into her village, killed all of the men and took the younger women – including her and her 14-year-old niece – away on buses. They took her to a warehouse filled with Yazidi girls and women. “A woman told us that every day Daesh men would come and have their pick of the girls, they took them, raped them, sold them on.” She was chosen by a leader. “He went to fight. And when he came back he dipped his big toe into a jar of honey and forced it into my mouth. After that he raped me.” </p> \n<p>One day, Noor tried to escape out of a window, but was caught. “He opened the door and allowed the six guards into the room,” she says. “He told the six guards to rape me. All of them, all kinds of ways, everything. I was made to do disgusting things. For two whole days I couldn’t move any part of my body.” She was sold, repeatedly to other men before finally managing to escape. “You can’t imagine what it was like. I want them to be punished. I have no hope for the future, as long as there are women and girls being held by Daesh. I can’t think about it.”</p> \n<p><br /><em>* Names have been changed and images disguised to protect identities of the women involved. </em></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8b4788159fcb1359bac058a4b70b29f52a78f84a/0_76_4000_2401/4000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2401,"width":4000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Linda Nylind for the Guardian","altText":"Students at Saltley Academy, Birmingham","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/ba4d9f05d10759deb029b1262ab064e99dcdd8d6/42_209_3621_2173/3621.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2173,"width":3621,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘There is no life with Daesh apart from rape and killing,’ was the message imparted by one 21-year-old woman, a former Isis captive.
