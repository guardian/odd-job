She repeatedly ventures into the crowd, much to the consternation of the bouncers. She puts a flower garland on her head, proffered by a fan. She encourages audience members to clamber on their partners’ shoulders. She asks the audience if they want to get high: this being Glastonbury, the answer is a resounding yes. She dedicates a cover of the Foo Fighters’ Times Like These to the band’s leader, “who was so incredibly supportive and kind to us”. She talks about ley lines. She reminisces about the days when she played in an outlying tea tent at the festival, “but I had a feeling everything was beautiful”. She throws shapes, barefoot and clad in a white trouser suit, backlit by orange lights: there are moments when she throws shapes with such abandon that we seem perilously close to the world of interpretative dance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f794315271347b34af9e5237882d68db9395f8ce\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f794315271347b34af9e5237882d68db9395f8ce/0_0_3659_2388/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Florence + the Machine Glastonbury 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"653\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Do you want to get high?’ she asks the audience. ‘Yes!’ they reply.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the obviously the kind of behaviour that wobbles perilously along the line that separates the grandiose gesture from ridiculousness. It’s in Welch’s favour that a headlining slot at Glastonbury potentiates the grandiose gesture. The more am-dram aspects of her performance, that might seem baffling in a smaller venue, succeed in reaching to the back of the vast crowd: likewise her voice, a strident and rather testing listen in a more intimate environment. </p> \n<p>The audience, understandably, lap it up: there’s a grand tradition, stretching back to the mid-90s, when Pulp filled in at short notice for the Stone Roses, of artists suddenly promoted to the headline slot winning the crowd’s affection, and so it proves here.</p> \n<p>It helps that Welch has a store of undeniably great songs to draw upon, many of them from her most recent album, How Big How Blue How Beautiful. In the context of the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury, there’s something infectious about her enthusiasm: her cover of Candi Staton’s You Got The Love provokes a mass singalong. She looks like a woman enjoying her unexpected moment, and it’s hard to begrudge her. <br /></p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3b14d736d25955a96a9f1ac457e2ae2105a5e9a3/186_704_2958_1774/2958.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1774,"width":2958,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Florence + the Machine","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Oli Scarff/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f794315271347b34af9e5237882d68db9395f8ce/0_0_3659_2388/3659.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2388,"width":3659,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Do you want to get high?’ she asks the audience. ‘Yes!’ they reply.

And the truth was so extraordinary that you almost couldn’t make it up …","byline":"Veronica Lee","body":"<p>Families are funny things, as the comedian Mark Steel would be the first to tell you. This famously leftwing performer – scourge of Conservative politicians in his live shows and his column in the Independent – is adopted and has recently unearthed a remarkable story about his birth parents, which he has turned into a stand-up show.</p> \n<p>But some of the details are so unlikely – he has discovered he is connected to global capitalists, international playboys and the British royal family – that audiences might doubt the story’s veracity. “I was doing a run-through the other night and stopped in the middle and said to the audience, ‘Surely now you’re all thinking, ‘He’s just fucking making it up. It’s like something out of a Jeffrey Archer novel,’” says Mark.</p> \n<p>His story starts straightforwardly enough. Mark was a few days old when he was adopted by a working-class couple in Swanley, Kent. His father, Ernie, was an insurance man who went door-to-door collecting weekly payments and his mother, Doreen, was a housewife who occasionally earned extra money by working in a factory or as a lollipop lady.</p> \n<p>An only child, Mark was close to his parents – Doreen is 90 now, his father died decades ago – but wouldn’t describe his childhood as happy. “It was mixed, I suppose. I mean, it wasn’t Josef Fritzl, but I much prefer being grown up.”</p> \n<p>Not for the first time, I notice that Mark speaks with a curious air of detachment about his life and, like many comedians, is expert at deflecting personal questions by using humour, in his case bone-dry.</p> \n<p>When did he first learn about the circumstances of his birth? “I knew I was adopted, strangely, before I knew where babies came from. I didn’t feel different or special, and I don’t ever remember giving the slightest damn about it. I knew because my very lovely auntie Gwen would tell the story of how she got talking to a blonde girl, Frances, who had moved into a flat in the same house in London. She was 19.</p> \n<p>“She was in a bit of a state because she was pregnant. Her parents didn’t know and she’d run away from home. It was 1959, so this wasn’t easy to deal with. So my auntie Gwen said to her, ‘Well, I’ve got a solution. Have the baby and give it to my brother.’ So this girl had me in 1960 and I was handed over to Doreen and Ernie.”</p> \n<p>Only it wasn’t quite so straightforward, as Mark discovered decades later when, as with many adopted people, becoming a parent himself prompted thoughts about finding his birth mother. “I don’t know why I did it really,” he says, “but I can honestly say it wasn’t because I was searching for myself. I thought maybe she might like to know how I had turned out.”</p> \n<p>Armed with the adoption papers, in 1996 he began what became an intermittent search for Frances. In 2009, after some leads came to nothing, he asked a professional researcher to help. She discovered that Frances’s family had moved in the 1970s from London back to their native Scotland, where Frances now owned a delicatessen. She, herself, however, was living in Rimini. “I thought, that’s exciting. I might be Italian.”</p> \n<p>The researcher wrote to Frances but six months went by and nothing came back, so she rang her. “Frances got very angry that she had called but then said she wanted to ask three questions. I thought, have you confused this with the plot of Indiana Jones? She asked: what does he do, does he have any children and what are his politics?</p> \n<p>“That is an extraordinary question, isn’t it? Of all the things to ask when the child you haven’t seen for 50 years turns up and your only thought is, I hope he doesn’t vote Liberal Democrat.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14998f31b761fdf0299bdfa86d96efa62c414f02\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435154415099/933f04ea-abd1-4d5a-b8f8-ebbbc140b371-356x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Steel, aged seven\" width=\"356\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Steel, aged seven</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Frances blurted out the name of Mark’s birth father before hanging up on the researcher, who recognised his surname as Sephardic Jewish. It turned out that his family, like many Jews, had fled the Nasser regime in Egypt in the mid-1950s, and settled in London.</p> \n<p>His father, 21 at the time – educated, dashing and moving in exalted circles – met Frances, a working-class girl whose father was a plumber, at a party. Mark was later to discover that she would disappear from home for days on end to go partying “up west” (the West End of London) and knew the Beatles. He has since seen a picture of her when she was about 25. “She’s wearing a Russian fur hat and a mini-skirt – the personification of mid-60s cool. She looked stunning. I suspect that explains a lot.”</p> \n<p>Frances was adamant that she wanted no contact with Mark. “I thought, that’s OK, but it’s a bit bloody rude isn’t it? Someone’s gone to all that trouble to find you, wouldn’t you be flattered and say come in, I’ll put the kettle on? I guess the only way I can understand it was that she kept saying [in 1960] ‘I want to keep this baby,’ and there were parents, social workers and all sorts saying she couldn’t, so when she eventually realised she couldn’t, she said ‘Fuck it, I’m putting it completely out of my mind’ – and was angry when it resurfaced.</p> \n<p>“But where I do think she was out of order is that she had no idea of how I had dealt with being adopted; for all she knew I had spent my life on a psychiatrist’s couch rocking backwards and forwards and saying, ‘Why was I rejected?’, and I was an alcoholic or a smack addict as my way of coping.</p> \n<p>“I would rather she had said, ‘I’d love to meet you, come to Rimini, bring the kids and we’ll all have a cup of tea, and I’m glad it turned out all right for you – but, sorry, Swanley is such a shithole.’ But she was adamant about not meeting me and I just have to accept that.”</p> \n<p>Frances died a year later, but in the meantime, on a whim, he had visited the delicatessen she owned in a small Scottish village. He was directed to her sister’s home nearby. She welcomed him in and he saw some leaflets for the Socialist party there. “I asked about them and she told me her husband was in Edinburgh that day marching against the cuts – it turns out the whole family are leftwing activists.”</p> \n<p>He has since met Frances’s other three siblings, who believe she might have eventually relented about meeting Mark had she lived.</p> \n<p>Frances married an Italian but never had more children, a fact that Mark has mulled over. “I think it would be better if she had because not having any more suggests she may have been affected by having me, which is a shame.”</p> \n<p>Mark might have given up the search – and not uncovered what would become great material for a show – if it hadn’t been for his wife, Natasha.</p> \n<p>“I wasn’t that bothered to pursue it but when I told Natasha she was on the internet within five minutes. My curiosity got the better of me, particularly when she discovered he was a backgammon champion. It’s funny, because when I was a teenager my parents gave me a travel backgammon set and it was around the same time he was playing high-roller tournaments.</p> \n<p>“Then we found out he was a multi-millionaire trader on Wall Street for several years. Members of the royal family used to visit his house in London and he hung out with millionaires, like John Aspinall and James Goldsmith, at the Clermont Club [a high-stakes private gambling club]. Just last night I discovered that five years ago he bought a house for $12m.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keAfx78i83U\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/keAfx78i83U?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Mark Steel live\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mark emailed him (now living in the United States) and he responded. “He said he remembered Frances vividly but it was all a bit of a shock because he had made all the arrangements to have me dispensed with. But she took the money and didn’t go through with it, bless her.”</p> \n<p>Mark adds sardonically: “I offered to repay it if he was bothered …”</p> \n<p>They later met in London, in his father’s old haunt, Mayfair. Mark liked him. “He was very dry, with a very Jewish sense of humour. In fact, I have to stop myself overdoing his Jewishness in the show because it’s so tempting.”</p> \n<p>Was he pleased to discover his Egyptian Jewish roots? “Well, it explains my colouring – but because it goes through the mother I’m almost but not quite chosen,” he says with a smile. “But then I’m used to disappointment, coming from the cultural wasteland of Swanley.”</p> \n<p>While Mark was delighted to discover Frances’s family’s leftwing politics – and how important his political leanings obviously were to her – he didn’t discuss the issue with his birth father. “Natasha did, though. They got into a bit of a tussle about global capitalism.”</p> \n<p>Father and son parted on good terms, however, and have remained in touch via email; Mark has “no urgent desire” to meet his two half-siblings, though.</p> \n<p>There has been a lot of laughter in our conversation, but Mark has hardly talked about his feelings, I say. “I’m not really interested in how I feel and I really don’t think anyone else is,” he responds. “An enormous amount of anguish has gone on, but not to me. To Frances, who would have been abandoned by her family had she kept me and who I now know delayed signing the adoption papers for 11 months, to the young father who wanted me aborted and to Doreen, who for the first year of my life didn’t know if she could keep me.”</p> \n<p>Mark and I have previously discussed the disproportionate number of comedians who are adopted – Stewart Lee and Rhona Cameron among them. He said then that however happy their childhoods were, perhaps having a sense of otherness – or, for some, detachment – helped them observe better how human beings tick.</p> \n<p>So was writing the show cathartic? “Writing anything is cathartic in some way, but I think this was driven by curiosity more than anything. And I think it’s funny – otherwise I wouldn’t do it. What I uncovered is so absurd, given my politics, that I just had to write it.”</p> \n<p>Doreen has given her consent for the show to be performed in public – “Oh blimey, she was a one, that Frances” – while Mark’s son, 19, and daughter, 14, are “just not that interested” in their dad’s new antecedents. What about his birth father? “I suspect he would rather I didn’t do it but he isn’t going to stand in my way.”</p> \n<p>He says he had a revelation about inherited traits when he found a story about his father in a magazine gossip column. He and some friends were on a yacht in the Mediterranean when someone fell into the water, and he dived in to rescue him. Several years later, the man bumped into Mark’s father and said: “Aren’t you the former backgammon champion?” Quick as a flash, he said: “No, I’m the man who saved your life, you cunt.”</p> \n<p>Mark laughs and says: “Natasha said I must be his son; his response was funny, feisty and sweary – which, she says, describes me perfectly. I never knew there was a sweary gene, but I’ll take it.”</p> \n<p>Did Mark learn anything about himself in the process of writing the show. “I started off convinced that we’re formed by our environment and genetic makeup accounts for very little, but now I know that doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. I think I’m a strange hybrid of Scottish Trotsky politics and Jewish humour, with a bit of Swanley thrown in.”</p> \n<p><em>Some names have been changed</em></p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Who Do I Think I Am?, Mark Steel’s show based on this story, is at Assembly George Square Studios, Edinburgh, 5-30&nbsp;August (</em><a href=\"https://www.assemblyfestival.com/event/96/\" title=\"\"><em>assemblyfestival.com</em></a><em>)</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435056093289/mark-steel-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mark Steel … 'What I uncovered is so absurd, given my politics, that I just had to write it down.'

But still, I think, it’s nice to be here, all together, on a random Sunday.</p> \n<p>“Your father is staring into space,” my wife says. “Who’s going to volunteer to talk to him?”</p> \n<p>“I will,” the middle one says.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435143924660/Tim-Dowling-column-illo-2-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling column illo 27/6/15","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435144086225/8077b3f9-4d30-4903-b24e-409b94c1a1d1-987x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":987,"orientation":"portrait","credit":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling illo June 27","cleanCredit":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T05:00:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T05:00:09Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":36,"contributors":[{"name":"Tim Dowling","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733750190/TimDowling.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/timdowling"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Life and style","Parents and parenting","Father's Day","Marriage"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fathers-day","webTitle":"Father's Day"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/marriage","webTitle":"Marriage"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tim Dowling","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/timdowling"}}],"series":{"title":"Tim Dowling's Weekend column","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/timdowlingsweekendcolumn"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fathers-day-tim-dowling-family-outing","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a2jm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fathers-day-tim-dowling-family-outing","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fathers-day-tim-dowling-family-outing"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Tim Dowling"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435143924660/Tim-Dowling-column-illo-2-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling column illo 27/6/15","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"The art of tarts / Recipes to make the most of your fruit","rawTitle":"Recipes to make the most of your fruit","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard","title":"The art of tarts: recipes to make the most of your fruit","trailText":"<strong>Ruby bakes: </strong>Ruby pairs peach with pepper for a sweet, spicy bake, then strawberries are piled high atop vanilla custard and sprinkled with pine nuts","standFirst":"<p>Ruby pairs peach with pepper for a sweet, spicy bake, then strawberries are piled high atop vanilla custard and sprinkled with pine nuts</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>There aren’t many things better than a mouthful of perfectly ripe peach – fuzzy-skinned and fragrant, bruising in your grip – or handfuls of jewel-red strawberries, tugged straight from their trailing stems. When fruit is right, it’s wrong to play around with it. But with summer fruit season in full swing, I find myself (always an overzealous shopper when the fruit’s there and ripe) with a glut piled so high in the fruit bowl that every so often a peach will roll drunkenly out with a thud. At these times, there’s nothing for it but to make fruit tarts,; and put the bruised bounty to good use.</p> \n<h2><strong>Peach and black pepper frangipane tart</strong></h2> \n<p>Peach and almond are made for one another, but they can verge on cloying if a third ingredient doesn’t perk them up. Here, it’s black pepper that adds that spark – lending a little heat which, along with the brightness of the orange zest, sets the sweet frangipane and fruit into sharp relief.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br /><strong>For the pastry</strong><br />135g plain flour<br />75g butter<br />50g ground almonds<br />30g caster sugar<br />A pinch of salt<br />1 large egg<br />Mascarpone, to serve</p> \n<p><br /><strong> For the filling</strong><br />75g unsalted butter, softened<br />50g caster sugar<br />50g runny honey<br />1&frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />Zest of 1 orange<br />100g ground almonds<br />1 large egg, plus 1 large egg yolk<br />50g plain flour<br />1&frac12; tsp coarse black pepper, plus extra for sprinkling<br />&frac34; tsp baking powder<br />A generous pinch of salt<br />2-3 large peaches, skins left on, cut into slim segments</p> \n<p>1 Rub the flour and butter together in a large bowl. Keep working the ingredients using your fingertips until no visible chunks of butter remain. Stir in the ground almonds, caster sugar and salt. Whisk the egg lightly, then add half of it to the flour mixture, cutting it into the dry ingredients. Continue adding until the dough begins to form in clumps. You shouldn’t need more than &frac34; of the egg. Once all the flour has been moistened, press the dough into a ball, flatten slightly and wrap in clingfilm. Refrigerate for 20 minutes or so, during which time the dough will become less sticky.</p> \n<p>2 Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface until it’s 26-27cm in diameter – big enough to line the base and sides of a 23cm-round tart or flan tin. You can also use a 20cm round loose-bottomed cake tin, if that’s all you have – just bake the filled tart for slightly longer to cook the slightly deeper filling. Line the tin with the pastry, prick all over the base with a fork and place in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes (this’ll reduce the risk of the pastry shrinking as it bakes). Meanwhile, set the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.</p> \n<p>3 Beat the butter and sugar together until light and creamy, then stir in the honey, vanilla extract, orange zest, ground almonds, egg and egg yolk. Combine the flour, pepper, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl before adding to the almond mixture and folding gently until smooth.</p> \n<p>4 Spoon the filling into the chilled pastry case, then arrange the peach slices neatly on top in concentric circles and grind plenty of black pepper on top. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven before reducing the temperature to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and cooking for a further 25 minutes. The pastry should be crisp, the filling slightly risen and springy, and the peaches perfectly tender. Leave the tart to cool to room temperature in its tin. Serve barely warm, with sweetened mascarpone.</p> \n<h2><strong>Strawberry vanilla custard tarts with pine nut crust</strong></h2> \n<p>The modest handful of pine nuts in this recipe round out what might otherwise have been an otherwise bland of a plain pastry case, while also making it richer, and crumblier, than ever.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 6</strong><br /><strong>For the pastry</strong><br />60g pine nuts<br />150g plain flour<br />75g unsalted butter<br />40g caster sugar<br />30ml milk</p> \n<p><br /><strong> For the filling</strong><br />175ml milk<br />2 large yolks<br />50g caster sugar<br />2&frac12; tsp cornflour<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />50ml double cream<br />250g ripe strawberries<br />2-3 tbsp strawberry jam</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, then roast the pine nuts for 7-10 minutes, checking them regularly, until they’ve darkened a shade and are beginning to look oily. Turn the oven off for the moment. Set aside 10g of the toasted nuts in a small bowl – you’ll use these to top the tarts later – and empty the bulk of the kernels into a food processor or coffee grinder. Pulse them until they’re finely ground, slightly greasy and starting to clump together.</p> \n<p>2 Put the flour in a large bowl and rub the ground pine nut mix into it with your fingers. Cube the butter and add it to the bowl, rubbing it into the dry ingredients until there are no visible chunks of butter left. Stir in the sugar, then add the milk, cutting it in until a dough forms in small clumps. If it’s too dry to hold together when you squeeze it, add a drop more milk. Gather the dough into a ball, pat it flat and wrap in clingfilm. Place in the fridge to chill for 20 minutes or so.</p> \n<p>3 Lightly dust the work surface and roll out the chilled pastry until it’s 3-5mm thick. Cut rounds out using a circular pastry cutter – one big enough to make circles of pastry to line the base and sides of the holes ofa standard muffin/cupcake tin. Gently press the pastry into the tin holes, taking care not to stretch it. Chill the lined tin in the fridge for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.</p> \n<p>4 Once the pastry cases have chilled, trim off any excess and line each with a small square of baking parchment (it can help to scrunch the parchment then smooth it out again before doing this, to help it mould to the contours of the pastry). Fill each parchment-lined tart with baking weights – whether the ceramic sort, or just makeshift ones such as dried chickpeas, rice or barley – and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the weighted parchment parcels and return to the oven to cook for a further 5 minutes uncovered, then leave to cool.</p> \n<p>5 Heat the milk for the custard until scalding. While the milk warms, whisk the egg yolks, sugar, cornflour and vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl. Slowly pour the scalding milk into this yolk mixture, whisking constantly as you go. Decant the mixture back into the pan and set over a low heat. Stir the custard over the heat for 5 minutes or so, until it’s very thick and gloopy. Cover the surface with clingfilm to stop a skin forming, then leave to cool to room temperature. Beat the cooled custard to smooth it before adding the cream and whisking for a minute. The custard should hold soft peaks.</p> \n<p>6 Hull and halve the strawberries. Fill each tart case with a generous dollop of the custard, then top with the strawberry pieces – I find four half-strawberries per tart is about the right amount, clustered together into a dome shape. Warm the strawberry jam, strain it and brush a little over each of the tarts to glaze. Chop the remaining toasted pine nuts and sprinkle them over the tarts. Serve straight away.T</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228754665/68ac0eda-a1f9-4c9b-9e5c-43427555669a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"A peach and almond tart with a twist of black pepper for piquancy, and the classic pairing of strawberry and vanilla in an extra-crumbly pine-nut tart case.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T04:59:06Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T04:59:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":5,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style","Fruit"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fruit","webTitle":"Fruit"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a5c2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228710181/d9af8e4d-669f-4522-9723-b41d06ddad6b-2060x1247.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1247,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A peach and almond tart with a twist of black pepper for piquancy, and the classic pairing of strawberry and vanilla in an extra-crumbly pine-nut tart case.

He is older than our daughter, but not by much. He is just walking, not yet talking – somewhere around a year, I’d guess. You are much younger than I am, a teenage mum, perhaps 15 years old. I must be twice your age. I couldn’t have considered being a mum at your age. But you are a mum, like me. And you care about your son, who is unwell and in hospital. I see you you playing with him, cuddling him.</p> \n<p>We’ve had a few talks since we’ve been on the ward. I teach girls your age. I enjoy talking to young people. I enjoy talking to other mums.</p> \n<p>We had a lot in common at that moment. Concerns and worries for the beautiful, tiny people we had had to bring to hospital.</p> \n<p>That is why I am sorry that I didn’t say anything. I should have backed up&nbsp;a fellow mum. I should have spoken&nbsp;up.</p> \n<p>I should have told the doctor to take you to an office or private room. I should have told him that a curtain drawn in a busy ward does not afford you any privacy. I should have told him I could hear the questions he was asking you. The questions that probed deeper into your life than the conversations we’d had about baby milestones and children’s centres. I could hear how his questions judged your choices. Judged your circumstances. Judged&nbsp;you.</p> \n<p>He may be a doctor. His job may be to conduct child protection interviews. But surely that should mean he thinks about your dignity. You should be the child protected. You <em>and</em> your son.</p> \n<p>I should have told him that I work with young people who have those interviews and that it is not OK to conduct them where members of the public can hear. It is not OK to excavate someone’s life in a public place, regardless of their situation. You deserved more.</p> \n<p>Instead I sat by awkwardly. I should have politely, but pointedly, told someone that I should not have access to that information about you. Instead I tried to look the other way; an uncomfortable eavesdropper.</p> \n<p>If I were in your position, I would have spoken up. I would have known that I could. I would not have accepted the authority of the white coat to expose my life to strangers. But those things are part of the reason that I am not in your position: my confidence, my education, my privilege.</p> \n<p>When you did not stand up for yourself, I did not stand up for you either. I let those in power treat you with so little respect. I let them devalue you, and the tiny little man you obviously loved so much.</p> \n<p>I am sorry I did not speak. I am sorry I listened. I am sorry that it was only in my head that I argued with that doctor in the white coat, for his lack of respect for your little family unit.</p> \n<p>I did write a letter. I sent it to the hospital. I’ve copied it to our local MP. I hope I’ve given you the voice you deserve. I hope that it helps other people to avoid the situation into which you were put. I wish I had spoken at the time, but the letter is a start – and next time, I will try to be the person I should be and speak <em>out.</em></p> \n<p>I hope that your son has recovered, as my daughter has. I hope that you are both well and enjoying life. I hope that he grows up to be a kind-hearted and friendly person like you seemed to be. I hope you are both content.</p> \n<p><em>The mum in the bed opposite</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T05:45:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T05:45:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Life and style","NHS","Hospitals","Doctors","Nursing","Health","Health policy","Children","Teenage pregnancy"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/nhs","webTitle":"NHS"},{"id":"society/hospitals","webTitle":"Hospitals"},{"id":"society/doctors","webTitle":"Doctors"},{"id":"society/nursing","webTitle":"Nursing"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"politics/health","webTitle":"Health policy"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"society/teenage-pregnancy","webTitle":"Teenage pregnancy"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"A letter to ...","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/aletterto"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/a-letter-to-the-teenage-mother-i-wish-id-defended-in-hospital","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avpb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/a-letter-to-the-teenage-mother-i-wish-id-defended-in-hospital","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/a-letter-to-the-teenage-mother-i-wish-id-defended-in-hospital"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":2,"kicker":{"title":"A letter to ..."},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[]},{"title":"Asif Kapadia on Amy / ‘The drinking, the bulimia, the drugs – nobody stopped it’","rawTitle":"‘The drinking, the bulimia, the drugs – nobody stopped it’","item":{"type":"article","id":"film/2015/jun/27/asif-kapadia-amy-winehouse-doc","title":"Asif Kapadia on Amy: ‘The drinking, the bulimia, the drugs – nobody stopped it’","trailText":"The Senna director fought hard to tell Amy Winehouse’s true story in his hugely hyped biopic and the result is a film that makes everyone feel complicit","standFirst":"<p>The Senna director fought hard to tell Amy Winehouse’s true story in his hugely hyped biopic and the result is a film that makes everyone feel complicit</p>","byline":"Paul MacInnes","body":"<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece\">Amy review: Asif Kapadia’s Amy Winehouse film is a tragic masterpiece</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Talking to Asif Kapadia can feel like talking to an obsessive; someone so fascinated by one thing that they have not only consumed all they could about their subject, but sworn to preserve the truth about them, too. That subject is Amy Winehouse. That truth is the complicated conjunction of circumstance and agency that led the singer to die from alcohol intoxication at the age of 27.</p> \n<p>“There’s a point in the process where you can start correcting your interviewees because you know the story now. I know it,” he says. “I know when someone’s telling me something true and when they’re making it up. I know when they’re putting themselves in her life. Or, I’ll start saying to people who say they met Amy: ‘I don’t think you really met Amy. The person you describe, that’s not Amy, by that point she’d changed and I don’t know what you’re talking about.’”</p> \n<p>A 43-year-old Londoner, Kapadia is the man behind Amy, a documentary that chronicles Winehouse’s tragic decline from bright-eyed prodigy to doomed tabloid obsession. Assembled from 100 interviews and incorporating 20 months of editing in a process that took three years in total, the film presents what feels like a true version of events. It is also incredibly moving.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A97-pQJD6Hw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A97-pQJD6Hw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The film has already been the subject of controversy, particularly with Winehouse’s father, Mitch, who told the film-makers they were “a disgrace” and believes the film is “trying to portray me in the worst possible light”. He also claims that interviews he gave for the film were edited, specifically those regarding what is now perceived as a turning point in Amy’s life – an attempt to send her to rehab in 2005 to deal with her drinking. The attempt failed and became the material for Amy’s biggest song. The film claims, like the song, that Amy didn’t go to rehab only on the say-so of her father. Mitch says he only thought Amy shouldn’t go to rehab “at that time”. He claims that those three words were edited from his interview.</p> \n<p>“He says that quite a lot, I think,” sighs Kapadia, who doesn’t use Mitch’s name once during our interview. “I interviewed him twice. The first time he didn’t say ‘at the time’. But the story is in the present. The lyrics of her song don’t say ‘at the time’: ‘Daddy says I’m fine, at the time,’ it doesn’t say that. When Amy writes something down [in song] it’s based on a real experience. That whole incident happened exactly the way [it’s described in the song]. Everyone involved admits that’s exactly how it happened.”</p> \n<p>Kapadia came to fame as the director of Senna, another study of a talented but tragic figure, the racing driver Ayrton Senna. The film used an innovative style Kapadia sometimes likes to call “true fiction”. Constructed almost entirely from archive footage, the story was told without any guiding voiceover, a weirdly unheard-of break with convention in the documentary format. Senna was also edited to feel like a drama, every moment put in service to the story. As it unfolded, the film grew from a chronicle of a sporting life into a study in ambition, bravery and – again – obsession. It went on to become a touchstone for other film-makers and a driver of the boom in cinematic documentary. For a while, conversations across the country began: ‘I’m not into motor racing but...”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f751cb58163138bed1d67121dc3fe779f0e057b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435224747937/5fed2594-3afc-4602-aaef-a1c1a3ada4bd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Asif Kapadia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asif Kapadia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The success of Senna led directly into Amy, thanks in part to Nick Shymansky, who had been having just that conversation with his new wife. It was the summer of 2011, it was raining, so the couple had ducked into a west London cinema. They loved the film they saw, despite not loving motor racing, and the format also inspired an idea in Shymansky. He had been Amy Winehouse’s first manager and was very much of the mind that someone should tell her story. Then, a few weeks later, Amy died.</p> \n<p>By 2012, Kapadia had been approached by Universal, Winehouse’s label, and invited to make a “warts and all” documentary, with full access to her back catalogue. Getting people to open up about her life, however, was to prove a different challenge. “There was no go-to person who knew Amy’s story, that’s what I found very early on,” he says. “There’s no definitive book. She just seemed to have a lot of people in different compartments. That’s what I started to find with the people I spoke to. And no one liked each other, they were all arguing, there was a lot of tension around her, always.” The first door that opened was with Nick. “When I called him, he said it was too soon, to leave her alone, let her rest in peace. But he told me the story [about Senna]. He said: ‘I’ll meet you, but I’m not interested.’”</p> \n<p>The pair eventually met in a Soho editing suite. On the wall, Kapadia and his editor Chris King had assembled a collage that resembled something from CSI or Homeland; a massive, interlocking mural telling the story of Amy’s life as they knew it. It struck Nick as being more effort than anyone had previously made in understanding what had happened to her. And so he began to talk.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a94b1102cf4d4c0ca81d01f37c4e24e4908ab7f2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435158363817/d2d6ab2a-aec2-4149-8c55-2eb9ca46ae35-460x354.jpeg\" alt=\"Back in white: a young Winehouse plays at home.\" width=\"460\" height=\"354\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Back in white: a young Winehouse plays at home.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I had no idea what this film was...” says Kapadia. “I had no thesis, I had no plan. I had the idea of doing a documentary but it’s all controlled, because I know what the beginning and the middle and the end is but if it changes I’m going to go with it and find a way to rewrite it. This was my research. But Nick just started to talk and talk. He spoke for five hours without thinking about it. He then said that wasn’t the half of it and we talked again. I probably recorded 15 hours but we would speak non-stop off the record and on email. No one had ever heard of this guy, but he had this huge story. Then he opened his laptop and said, ‘I’ve got these videos that I shot,’ and there’s all of the opening of the film.”</p> \n<p>The first section of Amy shows her as a teenager. Someone at once both precocious and diffident, she is eager to please but also to subvert. Shymansky’s footage was shot on a Mini DV camera and usually involves him cajoling Amy into playing up. She doesn’t want to perform, she hides her face behind a pillow, she’s trying to sleep. But when she’s eventually persuaded to play, she looks down the camera and you feel the charisma burn its way right through you.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/14/amy-winehouse-manager-nick-shymansky-interview\">Amy Winehouse's manager Nick Shymansky: ‘She’d be so sweet and funny. But there were warning signs…’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As Amy’s story develops, so the audience watching her grows larger. From Shymansky talking one-to-one to the global audience that pored over YouTube footage of Amy’s final, chaotic concert in Sarajevo, Serbia. Amy, says Kapadia, was born at the wrong time, caught on the cusp of an analogue and a digital world where notions of privacy were changing rapidly. “So there’s Nick talking to her and she’s looking straight into the camera. She’s talking to us, obviously, we become Nick. Then it goes on to TV cameras and we’re the audience. Then it gets darker and darker and it’s the paparazzi footage, and then there’s a point in St Lucia [in 2011] where she literally points at the camera and we’re caught out, we look away. I thought that was the most interesting thing, how the audience changed from Nick saying, ‘Go on give us a little flash it’s only us’ in the car to the paps going, ‘Come on, cheer up...’”</p> \n<p>The idea of Amy as the object of our attention is central to the film. It’s difficult to watch without feeling in some way guilty, responsible in however small a way, for helping to push a vulnerable person into a spiral that ultimately claimed her life. Kapadia says many Londoners drifted in and out of Amy’s world, drinking in the boozy culture of Camden Town, assuming a vicarious glamour, then going home (this includes Kapadia himself: “I keep on expecting to pop up in the background”, he says).</p> \n<p>Then there’s the journalists, like me, who spent the years of 2007-9 writing up every drunken fight she got involved in, every bizarre late-night trip to the newsagents. After watching Amy, the first thing I did was to Google my name and hers looking to see if I’d indulged in the mockery that is caught in the film; Graham Norton explaining to Jackie Chan in 2008, “Amy Winehouse, now she’s a mad person.” I found that I had not, that I was mocking the mockery. “A number of journalists have said that,” Kapadia smiles. “They say: ‘It’s fine, I was just commenting on everyone else.’ No one’s sure, and not just journalists. It’s interesting, isn’t it, because everyone did it. Everyone’s seen [the concert in] Serbia. How did we see Serbia? We looked it up, we shared it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58ac0172271a4e56a9a5a156ac864ac7f4a7fca3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435235415379/e6569ee2-a007-4228-a947-fb42b3f780e8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The calm before the storm… a young Amy Winehouse.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The calm before the storm… a young Amy Winehouse.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Amy is a film that makes you feel culpable, but it also stirs up waves of sympathy, of a desire to protect her and, also, an anger at those in her life who – you feel – could have done so much more to save her. This extends to pretty much everyone with whom she had a professional relationship (oh yes, and Blake Fielder-Civil). “It brought out the worst of a lot of people in her life,” says Kapadia. “If one looks carefully, there are lots of people who make lots of decisions or who were aware of one thing – whether it was the drinking, the bulimia, or the drugs – and nobody stopped it. That’s what the film is really about. It’s pretty heavy. You can’t quite imagine what it’s like when they’re in the film. To go through it all again, it’s really tough. There’s certain people who just can’t watch the second half.</p> \n<p>“But the second half is where most of the audience come on board,” he continues. “It’s not just about her any more, it’s about us. It’s about the city, it’s about the media, it’s about everything, people who have taken this in, enjoying, laughing at her. There’s a line I get a lot now when a certain person keeps saying stuff about me: ‘Well, it’s all right, isn’t it? All publicity is good publicity.’ Well, I’m not sure it is...”</p> \n<p><em><strong>Amy is in cinemas from 3 July <br /></strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3dd7be1aad86aff9bffe45d454f6f09ac223e272\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435235547732/bfcfc298-438b-4f13-8a66-562ed0c48ffa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Amy at 20\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amy at 20.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435149753860/09debd4a-5bde-4d8b-a829-8564368eef0f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Amy Winehouse.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435224749250/5fed2594-3afc-4602-aaef-a1c1a3ada4bd-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Asif Kapadia.
