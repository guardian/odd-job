Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited. Dirty rhythm, indeed! <strong><em>RLD</em></strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uO59tfQ2TbA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uO59tfQ2TbA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Mood: </strong>Discovering your favourite brand of sausage roll has just been “woops” at Asda</p> \n<p><strong>If you like this try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnIeRkCqD-E\">Rihanna – Bitch Better Have My Money</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rClUOdS5Zyw\">Jason Derulo – Want To Want Me</a></p> \n<h2>Laura Marling - Gurdjieff’s Daughter</h2> \n<p>The summer is such an amazing time. Sun (for at least a couple of weeks), trips to the outdoor swimming pool, endless reminiscing about that summer in 1995 when it was actually hot. Pogs! But now and then it’s not all jokes, and you might want some sage advice from a pal on how to keep it all together when the excitement gets a bit <em>too</em> much. Enter Laura Marling with her whimsical belter that pairs aforementioned advice with a kind-of country Bob Dylan voice and a strangely catchy chorus. The video will make you want to move to LA and hang out with cool friends like Marika Hackman as well. <em><strong>LB</strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hnKz9rlna4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hnKz9rlna4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Mood: </strong>Running through a field (shoeless) while trying to forget you’ve gone over your overdraft limit.

How the hell are you supposed to do a crow pose on the dancefloor? Yoga ditches Mon&aacute;e skippy funk and sounds like something Mike Will Made It and Calvin Harris hatched on an ashram retreat, all low-end wobbles and a euphoric, electro-charged chorus. But it’s not really about downward dogs, is it? Her new protege, Jidenna, gets a neat guest rap but otherwise it’s Queen Mon&aacute;e in a crown singing about flexing how she wants to, being her “own private dancer” and slipping words never before heard in club tunes into club tunes. Basically, it should win everything for the line “You cannot police me so get off my areola”. And you can dance to it however you like. <em><strong>KH</strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0OkB6p_FZAw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0OkB6p_FZAw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Mood: </strong>The girls night out equivalent of Beyonc&eacute;’s 7/11 girls night in</p> \n<p><strong>If you like this try</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Kg9xRooTVk\">Nicki Minaj &amp; Beyonc&eacute; – Feeling Myself</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV2uebhnqOw\">Britney Spears ft Iggy Azalea – Pretty Girls</a></p> \n<h2><p>Yung - Blanket</p></h2> \n<p>OK, so Danish punk might seem an unlikely source for summer vibez, but hear me out: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/mar/02/danish-punk-iceage-yung\">Yung are a snotty lot from the arty, anti-nuclear Scandi-city of Aarhus</a> who usually deal in stiff Joy Division-style post-punk, but here they’ve gone all nostalgic. Blanket is three minutes of warm and giddy fuzz concerning a half-remembered beach trip, which builds to the most euphoric refrain Japandroids never wrote. “I still remember that freckled faaaaace,” howls singer Mikkel Holm, and for a moment you’re right there reminiscing with him. <em><strong>GM</strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/tough-love/yung-blanket-1\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F205261368&amp;show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Mood</strong>: Kicking sand about on the beach while catching the distant call of an orca pod</p> \n<p><strong>If you liked this try</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4m6Ptx4CV6k\">Japandroids – Younger Us</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q76GCw8qQVA\">H&uuml;sker D&uuml; – Celebrated Summer</a></p> \n<h2>Major Lazer and DJ Snake – Lean On</h2> \n<p>There’s no better way to cool down after a blistering summer day than with Major Lazer and DJ Snake’s perfect chill-out track, Lean On. A powerhouse dance ditty without being overpowering, Lean On has many of the hallmarks for song of the summer status – from sultry lyrics you can sing along to provided by Danish singer M&Oslash; to a catchy hook. The genius of Lean On is similar to its success on the charts which caught many by surprise. After reaching the No 1 spot in a majority of the world, Lean On may have peaked too soon to be considered song of the summer, but perhaps it’ll find a way to break through. It’s done so before. <strong><em>RLD</em></strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqeW9_5kURI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YqeW9_5kURI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Mood: </strong>Beast mode</p> \n<p><strong>If you like this try: </strong>Sitting down for a while</p> \n<h2>Rihanna – Bitch Better Have My Money</h2> \n<p>One of the biggest differences between the UK and the US is the way people communicate. Instead of the slightly roundabout, ambiguous, veiled instructions we excel at in Britain, in America people like to go the route one approach. Just like Rihanna, who proves she wouldn’t be someone you’d want to borrow money from. Ever. Forget dodging her phone calls and walking a different route to the gym in order to avoid confrontations, she wants her moolah back and will turn your mum’s house into the final scene from Scarface if it doesn’t happen, pronto. This track raises the question: what happened to the acoustic, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=swRgOrKhP8M\">almost folkie RiRi of months past</a>? Loan shark Rihanna probably killed her when she was late on repayments.

Portland’s Unknown Mortal Orchestra have then written the most modern of disco mantras, deepened by the revelation that the blurry lyrics are actually about UMO Ruban Nielson and his wife’s polyamorous relationship with a girl he met on tour, and waiting to hear from her once she moved away. Beyond its cosmic longing, though, what Can’t Keep Checking My Phone has is lithe, lip-curling, falsetto-funk groove (yeah, I said it, <em>groove</em>). It’s giving someone in a wraparound bandana the eye at a festival. It’s tripping in the woods and rolling around on a Pendleton blanket. It’s Get Lucky, if Get Lucky was made by three acid-spangled guys with illuminati tattoos and tribal necklaces with a thing for Syd Barrett records. In other words, it’s brilliant. <em><strong>KH</strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdCCLxS1uK8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/DdCCLxS1uK8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Mood: </strong>Groovy drunk dialling</p> \n<p><strong>If you like this try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toU0_qZtOOA\">Tame Impala – Let It Happen</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mngHer_-wG4\">Toro Y Moi – Buffalo</a></p> \n<h2>Busy Signal – Whatsapp</h2> \n<p>Phone-based songs are clearly a thing in summer 2015 and dancehall’s own telecommunications king provides his own with a reference to the social media app du jour. There are quite a few competitors for summer anthems from the dancehall fraternity this year with the Jamie xx, Popcaan and Young Thug track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IkUKFdacHvo\">I Know There’s Gonna Be (Good Times)</a>, plus Vybz Kartel’s Grand Theft Auto inspired <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blIe9mZjTH4\">Fast Life</a> (which is like the anti-Wiz Khalifa) providing alternatives, but the sheer nonsense nature of Whatsapp sees Busy Signal edge it. Never has someone made lyrics about “hot spots” and “all night wining” sound so utterly wholesome, and it follows his similarly mobile-happy track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl1CsAdfaLk\">Text Message</a>, during which he berates a potential partner’s terrible spelling. Whatsapp is that happy it makes Unknown Mortal Orchestra’s ridiculously joyous song about a polyamorous relationship sound like a Throbbing Gristle track. <em><strong>LB</strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_H42cXlANOw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_H42cXlANOw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Mood</strong>: Just received this <a href=\"http://vine.co/v/OUljvzWBBiU\">Vine</a> via Whatsapp</p> \n<p><strong>If you like this try</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrfhAQjGGeY\">Konshens – Physically Fit</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmaYD4x_CTA\">Popcaan &amp; Freddie Gibbs – Born Bad</a></p> \n<h2>Shamir – Call It Off</h2> \n<p>Ever since Pharrell, Robin Thicke and Daft Punk collectively bludgeoned our eardrums into submission with the endless airplay of Get Lucky and Blurred Lines in 2013, I’ve flinched at the mere mention of the words “summer anthem”. Luckily, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/11/shamir-bailey-ratchet-on-the-regular\">Shamir</a>’s swooped in to undo the damage. The 20-year-old pop artist appeared seemingly out of nowhere last year – though is actually from Las Vegas suburbia – and released this candy-coloured, effervescently joyous single in April. His shimmery falsetto, an undulating synth hook and a thudding house beat combine to turn Call It Off into the perfect post-breakup soundtrack to newfound, unbridled freedom (and the word “call” in the title keeps this tenuous “phone theme” alive). <em><strong>TM</strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10Kc7RK2rOs\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/10Kc7RK2rOs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Mood: </strong>Finding a sweaty, unexpected second wind in a festival tent at 6am</p> \n<p><strong>If you like this try: </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nZStMpEDio\">Disclosure – Bang That</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7dGgf0ivEjs\">Roisin Murphy – Exploitation (Single Edit)</a></p> \n<h2><strong>Iggy Azalea ft Britney – Pretty Girls</strong></h2> \n<p>Pretty Girls defies its name by barging its way through the summer like a bitter, boozed-up bachelorette.

As camp and crass it is catchy, the song is a homage to the superpowers of the superficial. “Is it true that men are from Mars?” sings Brit during her highly Auto-Tuned cameo. “Is that why they be acting bizarre?” Go home pop music, you’re drunk. <em><strong>HG</strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uV2uebhnqOw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uV2uebhnqOw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Mood:</strong> Feeling sassy in the club, right before feeling sicky in the toilets</p> \n<p><strong>If you liked this try:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqtunQ4yd30\">Ty Dolla $ign ft Charli XCX and Tinashe – Drop That Kitty</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCGOUnyYTOw\">KStewart – Keeping You Up</a></p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6f65a2d48806a9f1cd339258b10e2be2584fdd5e/0_0_620_372/620.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty/Rex/Wireimage","altText":"Composite of Nicki Minaj, Shamir and Jonelle Monae","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty/Rex/Wireimage"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432241142011/69e64edf-020e-417d-a8cf-01abba92ab6d-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Private caller ignorer: Unknown Mortal Orchestra.

(The nickname “Full Metal Bitch” is truly the stuff of dreams.) In fact, for most of the film, it seemed the two would coexist as friends as opposed to romantic interests, but by the end, it seemed like Cruise’s character was more than willing to overlook that 20-year age gap.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://deadline.com/2015/04/sarah-wright-cast-in-tom-cruises-mena-barkhad-abdi-joins-the-wolf-who-cried-boy-1201405321/\">Kind of like what he’ll be doing alongside 31-year-old Sarah Wright Olsen</a> in the upcoming Mena.</p> \n<h2>6.

In 2006 (at 43) Depp romanced 21-year-old Keira Knightley in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest. And in 2011, he co-starred with 25-year-old Amber Heard, now his wife, in The Rum Diary. However, in 2012, 48-year-old Depp hooked up on screen with 24-year-old Bella Heathcote in Dark Shadows.

They may look like the best way to change policies, amend discriminatory practices or even determine the fate of a nation. It is for people to decide, politicians argue.</p> \n<p>But they are not always the right way to go, especially when it comes to gay rights or in fact, any minority issues. </p> \n<p>Friday’s referendum on gay marriage in Ireland has captured the world’s attention. If passed, it will make Ireland the first country to formally recognise same-sex marriage through popular vote. </p> \n<p>Win or lose, however, it is a dangerous practice and can set a precedent for other nations where public opinion might not be so enlightened or tolerant.<br /></p> \n<p>The idea that the majority can legitimise the right of a minority is fundamentally flawed. In the words of Ayn Rand, the Russian-American novelist, “individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities.”<br /></p> \n<p>There are plenty of examples on how popular votes could have catastrophic impacts in societies if they were to be sought on minority matters. The obvious example is the issue of marriage between white and non-white people in the US. </p> \n<p>Long before the American people would approve such marriages, it was judges who struck down discriminatory laws in various parts of America. If the majority had been asked whether white people could marry black people, it would have taken decades longer for them be able to do so. In 1967 when the US supreme court deemed anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, the American people were not ready for that decision.</p> \n<p>“If you grew up in the 1960s and 70s, it was quite possible to know adults then who said things like ‘I’m all for civil rights. But marriage between Negroes and whites? I don’t know.’ You might have been utterly baffled, but there it was,” wrote <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/21/wedding-bells\">Margaret Talbot in a 2012 issue of the New Yorker </a>magazine. </p> \n<p>She continued: “In 1968, the year after the supreme court struck down Virginia’s anti-miscegenation law, in Loving v Virginia, 72% of Americans disapproved of marriage between whites and non-whites, and only 20% approved.” In fact, it was not until 2000 that the US state of Alabama officially legalised inter-racial marriage. </p> \n<p>The majority is resistant, by nature, towards a minority. If it wasn’t for strict laws protecting minorities in the UK, for instance, what will guarantee that a Muslim female student would be to tolerated to wear hijab in school because of her religious affiliation? The majority would probably have never accepted that. In Iran, where Jews are in a minority, Jewish students would probably have had to go to school on Saturdays which is Sabbath, a religious holiday, if the state had not intervened.</p> \n<p>Many countries are looking closely on how Irish people will vote on Friday. There are nations who want to follow suit. Whereas Europeans, Irish people included, may be ready to approve same-sex marriages, people in the Middle East or Africa are not. It will be dangerous to encourage them to go to the polls on such matters. </p> \n<p>Ireland may well vote yes in the referendum as polls suggest, if they are to be believed. However exciting it might sound to LGBT advocates, Ireland’s referendum is only indicative of what people there think. What it does not do is legitimise or delegitime gay people’s right to marry. <br /></p> \n<p>As Rachel Maddow, the televison host of the MSNBC said: “Here’s the thing about rights – they’re not actually supposed to be voted on. That’s why there’re called rights.”</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fa11e940a385aea9d1368a4266ff84d8468dce33/48_0_3377_2027/3377.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2027,"width":3377,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Cathal Mcnaughton/Reuters","altText":"A restaurant displays a poster supporting the Yes vote, in the Caple Street area of Dublin in Ireland May 18, 2015.

So fuck you, Mad Men, you phoney grey-flannel-suit, male-chauvinist, no-talent, Wasp, white-shirted, racist, antisemitic Republican SOBs!”<br /></p> \n<p>His view of the initial episodes was pretty much universal among the 50 or so advertising folk from 1960s Madison Avenue I interviewed for my book, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2011/aug/07/real-mad-men-andrew-cracknell\">The Real Mad Men</a>. But they were a very specific and non-representational group, from the 10% or so of the business that formed the so called “Creative Revolution”. This was a bunch of renegade creative people rebelling against the advertising world as it then was and trying to change it from within. George’s and their problem with Mad Men was, I think, that it was all <em>too</em> real – and it reminded them of everything they hated about the business as they had found it. Their error was… they were blaming the messenger.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/gallery/2012/mar/27/real-mad-men-60s-ads\">The real Mad Men: ads from the heyday of Madison Avenue</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Mad Men wasn’t about them; it was about the overwhelming bulk of the advertising business, a business that behaved in exactly the way the series portrays it. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Attitudes, client behaviour, a dry witty cynicism (I’ve met Roger Sterling types at least 10 times in my career), Peggy’s trajectory, career development – or not – hierarchical behaviour, professional relationships, finance, or scenes like the all-night session to prepare for the breakaway agency – all are almost uncannily spot on. From huge issues, such as the atmosphere around the loss of a major client, to trivial incidents, such as spats between art directors and copywriters, creative contempt for account people – and for everything to do with McCann Erickson – or petty jealousies in creative reviews: everything is spot on.</p> \n<p>Wider historical accuracy, too, is impeccable. Early on, Don discusses a VW ad saying: “I don’t know what I hate about it most – the ad or the car.” It would have been much easier for the writers to have had him praise it – in 2000, it was voted as part of the greatest print campaign ever written. But the series was faithful to the time; Don’s view was the overwhelmingly prevailing attitude, the campaign representing a whole new departure in advertising that was initially deeply misunderstood. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojtMtIyD6dM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojtMtIyD6dM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  “Honesty - it’s a great angle”\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another example was a brief, apparently inconsequential, exchange at a bar between Roger and Don some time in 1962.

It is probably unfair to complain Miliband couldn’t do it</p>","byline":"Steven Poole","body":"<p>One cannot help but admire the bovine hustle with which the Labour party and most of the commentariat converged on the story that it had lost the election not because it had chosen the wrong Miliband, but because it had failed to&nbsp;address voters’ “aspirations”. As an&nbsp;analysis of campaign rhetoric this is&nbsp;obviously false – Ed, after all, had repeatedly banged on about wanting to&nbsp;see “<a href=\"a href=\" %e2%80%9dhttps:=\"\" twitter.com=\"\" d_miliband=\"\" tatus=\"\" 93144755262861312\"\"=\"\" title=\"\">working people succeed</a>”. So&nbsp;what does “aspiration” in political language really mean?</p> \n<p>Aspiration is literally breathing, or breathing into: in the earliest English usages it was the sort of thing that the holy spirit or God did to people. In that sense it is probably unfair to complain that Miliband couldn’t do it too. The sense of wanting something is a metaphorical usage: to aspire to something is to breathe one’s desire towards it. Right now the Conservatives are, at least from one perspective, certainly building an aspirational government – one that gives hope to the common folk that their desires, too, may one day be fulfilled.</p> \n<p>Already last summer, for example, lawyer Jeremy Wright could be <a href=\"http://barristerblogger.com/2014/07/15/jeremy-wright-least-distinguished-attorney-general-two-hundred-years/\" title=\"\">plucked straight from the criminal bar</a> to become attorney general because the old one had been giving inconveniently accurate advice about the law. And now Michael Gove has become minister of justice despite, like his predecessor, having had no legal training whatsoever. That should give encouragement to all the children being miseducated in failing “free schools”, which are so named in&nbsp;contrast to the miserably unfree majority of schools, obliged to employ qualified teachers and teach a broad factual curriculum.</p> \n<p>The Tories also have big aspirations for the nation (an “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2012/oct/10/david-cameron-leader-aspiration-nation\" title=\"\">aspiration nation</a>”, David Cameron called it in 2012). There is that talk of a “seven-day NHS”, as though hospitals currently close on Sundays. (A real cynic might suspect that the promise to do something for which there is no money is setting up an excuse for more privatisation of health services.) Yet while “aspiration” is all well and good for voters, for politicians it is well understood to be defined as&nbsp;a&nbsp;promise you don’t have to keep. A&nbsp;promise you do have to keep is a&nbsp;“pledge”. Shortly after the 2010 election, for example, the Conservative-led coalition pleaded that its promise of a&nbsp;new &pound;200m cancer-drugs fund was&nbsp;merely, um, “<a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-1306203/200m-cancer-drugs-pledge-aspiration.html\" title=\"\">aspirational</a>” and so&nbsp;wouldn’t in fact come to pass.</p> \n<p>“Aspirational” – which used to be&nbsp;more or less synonymous with “inspirational” – is thus revealed in modern political language to be much closer to its marketing or fashion-industry sense. An “aspirational” advert is one featuring a lifestyle-modelling character that the viewer wants to be but isn’t and probably won’t ever be. An “aspirational” handbag is one sold at such an eye-watering price that most people will not in fact be able to buy it. Consumers who still “aspire” to own something by the brand will theoretically then spend less money on some proportionately even more overpriced gewgaw such as a purse or keyring.</p> \n<p>Perhaps this devilish bait-and-switch enables us to understand better what political talk of “aspirations” for the masses really mean. Labour leadership hopeful Andy Burnham recently defined “aspiration” as “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/13/andy-burnham-labour-leadership-launch-calls-for-aspirations-of-1997\" title=\"\">giving every single person the dream of a better life</a>”. Perhaps inadvertently, he thus implied that just the dream will do. What the Conservatives understand very well is&nbsp;that the promise of getting richer is a&nbsp;useful device to lure poor voters, and then can safely be forgotten about for the next five years while you set about making them even poorer.</p> \n<p>As we find ourselves, then, living in&nbsp;this brave new world of “blue-collar conservatism” –&nbsp;a pleasant image that puts me in mind of Bruce Springsteen suddenly declaring his support for Sarah Palin – the key is “sticking to the plan” that didn’t work as promised last time, and enforcing moderate speech on all citizens through the exciting new threat of an “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QVfwa-rDls\" title=\"\">extremism disruption order</a>”. The extremism of the new government itself, on the other hand, may continue serenely undisrupted. Even if its intention to scrap the Human Rights Act, among other illiberal menaces, amounts to a lengthy aspiration disruption order served on the British public at large.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4d66e8455805ddde099f551e1e1c9ab3a93e0086/0_85_1920_1151/1920.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1151,"width":1920,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Handout","altText":"Artwork by Stephen Millar, Creative Exchange Artists.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Handout"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T08:00:08Z","lastModified":"2015-05-22T08:09:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":22,"contributors":[{"name":"Steven Poole","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stevenpoole"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Reference and languages","Books","Culture","Language"],"tags":[{"id":"books/referenceandlanguages","webTitle":"Reference and languages"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"science/language","webTitle":"Language"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Steven Poole","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stevenpoole"}}],"series":{"title":"Steven Poole on words","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/series/steven-poole-on-words"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/22/aspiration-nation-the-many-meanings-of-a-political-buzzword","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/495y5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/may/22/aspiration-nation-the-many-meanings-of-a-political-buzzword","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/22/aspiration-nation-the-many-meanings-of-a-political-buzzword"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432229563802/686ba47a-4e07-4f3b-90aa-ec321c55bae6-2060x1395.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1395,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Artwork by Stephen Millar, Creative Exchange Artists.","credit":"Illustration: h/o","altText":"Artwork by Stephen Millar.","cleanCaption":"Artwork by Stephen Millar, Creative Exchange Artists."}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Aspiration nation?"},"byline":{"title":"Steven Poole"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Global warming / 'Stable' Antarctic ice sheet may be collapsing","rawTitle":"'Stable' Antarctic ice sheet may be collapsing","item":{"type":"article","id":"environment/2015/may/21/stable-antarctic-ice-sheet-may-have-started-collapsing-scientists-say","title":"'Stable' Antarctic ice sheet may have started collapsing, scientists say","trailText":"Southern Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet losing ice 8,500 times the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza every year, satellite data shows","standFirst":"<p>Southern Antarctic Peninsula ice sheet losing ice 8,500 times the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza every year, satellite data shows</p>","byline":"Karl Mathiesen","body":"<p>A vast slab of Antarctic ice that was previously stable may have started to collapse, according to new analysis of satellite data.</p> \n<p>Research <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaa5727\">published in the journal Science</a> on Thursday found the Southern Antarctic Peninsula (SAP) ice sheet is losing ice into the ocean at a rate of 56 gigatons each year – about 8,500 times the mass of the Great Pyramid of Giza. This adds around 0.16mm per year to the global sea level.</p> \n<p>The sheet’s thickness has remained stable since satellite observations began in 1992. But Professor Jonathan Bamber of Bristol university, who co-authored the study, said that around 2009 it very suddenly began to thin by an average of 42cm each year. Some areas had fallen by up to 4m.<br /></p> \n<p>“It hasn’t been going up, it hasn’t been going down – until 2009. Then it just seemed to pass some kind of critical threshold and went over a cliff and it’s been losing mass at a pretty much constant, rather large, rate,” said Bamber.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7d41f68faa8b6128d0c5811fab45e4a84cd1b6d2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432226572878/8a78506c-4e28-47e7-b47c-da0cf05a3fd3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Southern Antarctic Peninsula Ice loss\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Detail of the southern Antarctic Peninsula, showing ice loss recorded by the CryoSat satellite in 2014.

Less snow can pile up on top of the sheet, the snow can become more compacted or the rate at which the ice is lost into the sea via glaciers can increase. The latter effect, to which the study attributes much of the observed thinning, can destabilise the sheet and cause it to collapse.</p> \n<p>Bamber said the findings were particularly concerning because the SAP ice sheet sits on land that slopes downward away from the sea. This allows currents of relatively warm water to push inland, undermining and further destabilising the sheet. </p> \n<p>“This part of Antarctica is believed to be inherently unstable. So what that means is you only need to give it a nudge and it will go into a different state. And it looks like its been nudged into a different state where it looks like it’s going to a considerable amount of mass for considerable amounts of time – years to decades,” he said.</p> \n<p>Bamber said further modelling of the sheet would be able to confirm whether or not the sheet had entered into a centuries-long irreversible collapse. The sheet contains enough water to raise the world’s oceans by 20cm – more than the rise caused by climate change over the whole 20th century.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXVWGGmNRiI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dXVWGGmNRiI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Land sloping inland allows warm water to undermine ice sheets.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The SAP ice sheet is bordered by the ice sheets of West Antarctica and the Northern Antarctic Peninsula, both of which have begun catastrophic collapses that could raise sea levels by metres over the coming centuries. The mass currently being shed by the SAP ice sheet is more than half the amount <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2014/may/12/western-antarctic-ice-sheet-collapse-has-already-begun-scientists-warn\">being shed by the giant West Antarctic sheet</a>. </p> \n<p>“If you add [the ice loss from Antarctic ice sheets] to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2014/dec/15/greenland-ice-melt-underestimated-study-says\">what’s happening in Greenland</a> you’re seeing a really worrying increase in mass loss from the ice sheets. It’s not plateauing, it doesn’t look like it’s stabilising. It just seems to be increasing,” said Bamber.</p> \n<p>But Andrew Shepherd, a professor of Earth observation at Leeds University, said the study had overestimated the effect of ice loss from below. He said a large reduction in snowfall and compacting of the snow could account for much of the thinning.</p> \n<p>“I think the new estimates of ice loss computed from them are far too high, because the glaciers in this sector just haven’t speeded up that much. It could be that a bigger chunk of the thinning is down to snowfall fluctuations than the authors have accounted for, and so I would be cautious about the new numbers until more information is to hand,” he said.</p> \n<p>“It’s very hard to see how we could have got the snowfall estimate wrong,” said Bamber. He said the study had used two sets of satellite data that measured different aspects of the ice – meaning the error would have to be replicated across both sets of results. “They are totally independent and they both give us the same result. That gave us a lot of confidence.”</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432226334634/53161ffd-95b7-420d-8d4a-c1f09f05c650-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"CPOM/Leed/ESA","altText":"Antarctica’s ice loss","cleanCredit":"Photograph: CPOM/Leed/ESA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432226573591/1e7a8f26-4c6e-4430-a986-8ba4e2d48a4c-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Detail of the southern Antarctic Peninsula, showing ice loss recorded by the CryoSat satellite in 2014.

After Katie calls a child a “fat Nazi” in self-defence, she and Louise are forced to go on the run in some sort of objectionable car – probably a Range Rover Evoque. Owing to a series of unspecified previous controversies, they can’t drive through half the counties that would permit a direct route to freedom, and have to navigate a&nbsp;roundabout path via various telly sofas and media platforms. Throughout this inexorably doomed journey they are pursued by a sensitive cop, played by Leslie Grantham.</p> \n<h2><strong>Mastershit</strong></h2> \n<p>With “conflict” and&nbsp;social media typhoonery now the holy grail of all televisual enterprise, it&nbsp;was inevitable the BBC would find itself here for the third part of its highly acclaimed Master trilogy, which also includes Mastermind and MasterChef. Mastershit, AKA the Great British Hate-off, pits Hopkins and Mensch against one another in a&nbsp;series of gruelling rounds designed to crown one or other of them – but most likely Katie – Britain’s Most Controversial.</p> \n<p>These include the minor round, which seeks to establish which of these two over-40-year-olds can be most lavishly unpleasant to someone under the age of 18, and the specialist subject round. Louise’s area of expertise is Jewish history, inspired by the time she declared herself implacably opposed to anyone who used the term Zionist. Even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl\" title=\"\">Theodor Herzl</a>, wondered someone. “Who?” Louise <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/08/18/louise-mensch-theodor-herzl-zionist-twitter_n_5688177.html\" title=\"\">hit back</a>. “If he uses Zionist, then yes. Cheap code word for Jew. Antisemitism. Not having it.” Katie’s <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/katie-hopkins-when-is-enough-enough-10186490.html\" title=\"\">specialist skill</a>, meanwhile, is listening to an interlocutor read&nbsp;out a series of phrases and identifying whether they originated in her published output or the Nuremberg Laws.</p> \n<h2><strong>Hearts of Darkness</strong></h2> \n<p>As any regular readers of this column will know, in the years BD (Before Downton), there was one rule to ITV Sunday-night drama. Anything in the 8pm timeslot had to either have the word “heart” in the title, or be part of what we might respectfully call the Heartbeat universe. The first category included things such as Where the Heart Is and Wild at Heart, while Heartbeat – the overlap in our Venn diagram – spawned 60s hospital drama The Royal. The Royal itself would go on to spawn The Royal Today. Anyway, Hearts of Darkness revives this golden era of broadcasting. Premise? Katie and Louise play palliative care nurses. Drama ensues. It’s set somewhere rural – obviously somewhere with a cliff – which allows for gorgeous aerial shots to make up for any gaping plot holes. Maybe Dover. Yes, it’s a palliative care hospice on the white cliffs of Dover. We’ll thrash out the rest later, but I can tell you now that it features vigilante border patrols and a permanently appalled Pam Ferris.</p> \n<h2><strong>Hopkins &amp; Mensch</strong></h2> \n<p>Or Mensch &amp; Hopkins – their agents can fight about the billing. The key thing is, it’s a buddy cop show in which two strong characters are thrown together and forced to solve&nbsp;a crime. Crucially, of course, these are lady cops, with all the investigative drawbacks that implies – namely, they can’t just crack a case by going to one of their <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tom&amp;defid=1485786\" title=\"\">toms</a> for a tip-off and a freebie. In fact, for the first few episodes, the investigation seems to be going nowhere, mainly because every time they get a suspect into custody, DS Mensch releases them without charge on the basis that she has to go and pick up her kids. But as the series advances, the pair’s working partnership gels to devastating effect, and their mastery of the classic “bad cop, bad&nbsp;cop” routine culminates in an interrogation scene so extreme it will never leave you. Series two is set in The Hague.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432228708185/Thelma-And-Louise-Film----009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Our two heroines are forced to go on the run Thelma and Louise-style.
