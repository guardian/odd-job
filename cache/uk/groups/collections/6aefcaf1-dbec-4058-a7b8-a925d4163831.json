Eschewing medical realism, Cooper simply evokes the malformations of Joseph Merrick’s body. Even his gait, with left knee permanently crooked, suggests a man whose trunk cannot sustain the weight of an outsize head. Cooper, a fine actor, also makes you believe in the romantic sensibility that existed inside Merrick’s distorted frame.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2014/dec/08/the-elephant-man-bradley-cooper-review\">The Elephant Man review – Bradley Cooper is almost unrecognisable</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Much as I admire Cooper’s performance, I still find Pomerance’s play – as I did on its Hampstead theatre premiere in London in 1977 – thin and tendentious. It shows how Merrick, in the Victorian England of the 1880s, was initially exhibited as a fairground freak. Abandoned by his employer and lynched by a mob at Liverpool Street station, he is rescued by a young surgeon, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Frederick_Treves,_1st_Baronet\">Sir Frederick Treves</a>, who takes him under his care at the London Hospital. Fed, clothed and protected, Merrick reveals himself to be a man endowed with an artistic instinct and acute intelligence. But he also becomes an object of curiosity to high society, as well as a source of career-advancing research to Treves, before his untimely death at the age of 27.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eba0f560ef8255ec958df94170e126df2df1b7ba\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433104176082/00c9d32a-1cb0-434f-9ef9-89e3fdc14bbd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bradley Cooper, Patricia Clarkson and Alessandro Nivola in The Elephant Man.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bradley Cooper, Patricia Clarkson and Alessandro Nivola in The Elephant Man.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joan Marcus</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You can read into the story whatever you wish. On one level, it can be seen as a testament to the benefits of Victorian philanthropy. Pomerance, however, is chiefly concerned to use it as an indictment of social hypocrisy. Merrick’s narcissistic visitors treat him as a mirror for their own concerns, Treves is seen as morally little better than a fairground showman, and is driven into a guilt-ridden breakdown by his belief that his attempt to “normalise” Merrick has hastened his death. The conclusions, however, don’t follow from the evidence. It is hard not to feel that Merrick wasn’t better off under protective medical care. It also strikes me as dubious to attack the Victorians for treating him as the gaze and show of the time when we ourselves are invited to see his story as a theatrical spectacle.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Much as I admire Bradley Cooper’s performance, I still find Pomerance’s play thin and tendentious.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Even if the play never gets to grips with Victorian society’s complex attitude to evolution, it is well presented in Scott Ellis’s production. Aside from Cooper’s obvious empathy with Merrick and ability to suggest his unfulfilled longings, there is a strong performance from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/jun/25/patricia-clarkson-interview\">Patricia Clarkson</a> as the Victorian actor Mrs Kendal, who offers the secluded hero a glimpse of female beauty: the scene where she disrobes in front of Merrick is played with great delicacy. Alessandro Nivola also makes what sense he can of Treves’s descent into self-destructive torment. But, although the production is well done and makes you long to see Cooper in challenging classic roles, the play itself constructs its assault on do-gooding Victorian society on the shakiest foundations.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> At <a href=\"http://www.trh.co.uk/whatson/3637/\">Theatre Royal Haymarket</a>, London, until 8 August.

But don’t go saying La Havas has soul</p>","byline":"Harriet Gibsone","body":"<p>There have been three seismic shifts in Lianne La Havas’s life since she started releasing music in 2011. The first was a rekindled romance. The second was a trip to Jamaica, where she experienced a creative epiphany. And the third – and possibly the biggest upheaval of all – was the arrival of a small man famous for wearing purple.</p> \n<p>For two years, she and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/prince\" title=\"\">Prince</a> courted, professionally speaking. He made the first move, covering her song Lost and Found at a gig, inviting her to his Paisley Park complex in Minneapolis and then on to his Art Official Age album, before allowing her to steal the show during a Saturday Night Live performance. They revived their friendship last year when he came to London for his Hit and Run tour. It was quite a celebrity endorsement: one of music’s greatest showmen sipping tea (honey, no milk, in case you were wondering) and holding a press conference in your front room.</p> \n<p>Prince’s flamboyance hasn’t hugely influenced La Havas’s forthcoming second album, Blood, however. Perhaps more infectious was his calmness and sense of mystery. But trying to tease out gossip about him is futile. “His magic, if you will, will always be there,” she says, smiling, as if suppressing some kind of memory. I’m not surprised she is private about him: only a fool would spill the beans. He has, she says, heard (and approved of) one song from Blood: the single Unstoppable. Produced by Paul Epworth, and using an instrumental recorded by the Invisible, it is a luxurious, cosmic ballad written about a relationship with her former bass player, with whom she broke up “and was filled with regret and attempted to repair it”. Its lyrics transcend the pedestrian pangs of love and pain (unless you’re the kind of person who can relate to a satellite “floating through the darkest reaches of space”).</p> \n<p>We are in a pub close to La Havas’s house in north London to talk about the past few years and her sophisticated new sound. Her songs remain smooth, teetering on the fringes of jazz, the type of thing that would segue nicely into <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/rodrigo-y-gabriela\" title=\"\">Rodrigo y Gabriela</a> on Jools Holland’s Hootenanny. Only this time, as well as gloss, there is defiance – a leap from the sweet acoustic stories of her 2012 debut, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/jul/08/lianne-la-havas-love-big-enough-review\" title=\"\">Is Your Love Big Enough?</a>, and earned her Ivor Novello and Mercury prize nominations. There are moments on Blood that recall the artistry and ambition of Jill Scott or <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/lauryn-hill\" title=\"\">Lauryn Hill</a>, comparisons that have led to La Havas being described as a neo or nu-soul artist. These are not labels she welcomes.</p> \n<p>“I eventually want to get rid of genre,” she says. “I don’t think it helps. The music is what it is. The 10 tracks on my album – none of them sound the same to me. Also …” She pauses. “I just think soul gets misused. Whatever you are singing about, you are singing about a real thing. So someone like Bon Iver could be considered a soul artist rather than folk because he plays acoustic guitar. So I would not be happy with ‘neo soul’.”</p> \n<p>These generalisations are, she thinks, based on skin colour alone. “I have a big problem with it.I don’t know how deep I want to go into it now because I have a lot to say on it, but I just don’t believe you should be classed a certain genre because of your skin colour. It seems ludicrous because I don’t think people make stuff sound the way it does because of their colour.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFic-xaLsPs\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YFic-xaLsPs?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>She stops again. “I want to use my words correctly, but I think anyone could make anything if they want – and it shouldn’t be categorised by their race. I feel very strongly about it. I have a particular problem when stuff is called ‘black’. Because I don’t know what that is. I don’t think stuff should be called that because the person who made it is brown. It’s as bad as saying something is white. So that’s all I am going to say.”</p> \n<p>La Havas – real name Lianne Charlotte Barnes – is the only child of a Greek, bus-driving father and a Jamaican postwoman mother. Her parents split when she was two and, because of her mother’s work commitments, she would often stay with her grandparents who lived round the corner from her house in south London. One day, she just never went back home and moved in permanently with her grandmother, grandfather and great grandmother – which may explain why she sometimes speaks like an old soul trapped in a 25-year-old’s body.</p> \n<p>It is also why family and identity are at the core of Blood. The record was largely inspired by a holiday she and her mother went on, to Christiana in Jamaica, where a lot of her extended family still live. “It was very emotional to meet that family at the airport. I&nbsp;hadn’t seen my aunt since I was about five. She used to live with us in London then went back to Jamaica and got married, so I hadn’t seen her for ages. I was like: am I going to recognise her? Is&nbsp;she going to recognise me? But she did, and I did, and I just started crying.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f7075eb0434204e060b3e54a64a59855e20221c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432916115330/a0f2d4b4-df05-454d-9598-7622f9631057-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Lianne La Havas on stage.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lianne La Havas on stage.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gus Stewart/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>During her exploration of the country, La Havas met reggae and dancehall star Stephen McGregor, also known as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4x9x41nCNuw\" title=\"\">Di Genius</a>, son of the veteran reggae artist Freddie McGregor. She went to Kingston for two days and began to feel “strangely at home” in their studio. “It was then I realised that that’s my job and that’s what I do – I go to studios and jam. I felt really relaxed. That caused the need to go back a second time, which was when I had this amazing trip and wrote lots of songs.”</p> \n<p>One appears on the album, a song called Midnight, featuring a climatic, lightbulb-shattering vocal. “I actually didn’t know I could do that. But during the writing process, I thought, ‘What if it goes up an octave?’ I just tried it and was so relaxed there. Also, the humidity helps the singing in a weird way. The trip made me feel more independent.”</p> \n<p>New tracks like Green and Gold and the majestic Grow are testament to this liberation. Beyond the stargazing and the odd moment of existential despair is hope. “I wanted it to be hopeful. I wanted it to be joyous, I guess. I seemed to feel better as I did each part of this album. I was using music to discover what I liked. Womanhood, feeling like an adult, but not being quite mature yet – I wanted to celebrate that.”</p> \n<p>Blood is not without its moments of easy listening. But there is something unusual about her music compared to the rest of the millennials currently selling records. There is no trace of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2013/sep/05/london-grammar-if-you-wait-interview\" title=\"\">London Grammar</a>’s quarter-life crisis, nor is there Sam Smith, Ed Sheeran and Adele’s hankering for long-term commitment, for joint bank accounts, for settling down. Lurking beneath the serenity, La Havas, with her astral love affairs and first-name terms with the most libidinous man alive, is a star. Floating through the darkest reaches of space.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://www.liannelahavas.com/splash/splashpage_6\" title=\"\">Blood is out on Warner on 31 July</a>.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432915358027/ea1836ec-5d81-4698-83f8-2fb078ee857d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andy Hall for the Guardian","altText":"'I want to get rid of genre' … Lianne La Havas.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andy Hall for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432916117032/a0f2d4b4-df05-454d-9598-7622f9631057-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Lianne La Havas on stage.

A rapacious gourmand with insteps and Eraserhead hair, Dear Leader was both pop icon and ruthless dictator: as known for his love of Cognac and squadron of Joy Division babes as he was for the cunning nuclear brinksmanship with which he dissuaded the Bush administration from dispatching him the same way it had dispatched his “failed-state” colleague, Saddam Hussein. </p> \n<p>Now, with Kim’s son Kim Jong-un in charge, the rumour business is booming.

The story went viral, before <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jan/06/story-kim-jong-un-uncle-fed-dogs-made-up\">it was traced back to a Chinese satirist’s blog</a> on Tencent Weibo.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Critical thinking just goes out the window on North Korea</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Chad O’Carroll, NK News</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Only this month, South Korea’s national intelligence agency reported Kim had publicly obliterated another insider,<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/video/2015/may/13/north-korea-defence-hyon-yong-chol-archive-kim-jong-un-video\"> general Hyon Yong-chol</a>, with an anti-aircraft gun. The story was widely circulated before the agency adjusted its claim: Hyon had been “purged” for “dozing off” at official events, but <a href=\"http://%20http//www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/14/south-korea-rows-back-over-north-korea-anti-aircraft-gun-execution-claim\">might still be alive</a>. </p> \n<p>“Critical thinking just goes out the window on North Korea,” observed Chad O’Carroll, founder of the <a href=\"https://www.nknews.org/\">NK News</a> website.

The Toronto Sun’s <a href=\"http://www.torontosun.com/2014/10/10/craziest-rumours-about-north-korea\">craziest rumours about North Korea</a> post alleges that North Korean Olympians who fail to win a medal are sent to the gulags, and Pyongyang officials supported Scottish independence “for the Scotch alone”.</p> \n<p>Stories that discredit these rumours are rarely given the same fanfare or weight. The revelation that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DICmivy5uP8\">the YouTube documentary</a> about the Pyongyang traffic lady is fake is buried in the comments page; Kim Jong-un’s pop-singer girlfriend’s <a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/north-korean-ex-lover-kim-jong-appears-not-executed-article-1.1796085\">appearance on KCNA</a> a year after reports of her grisly murder failed to reach the same million consumers who believed her dead; North Korean gulag survivor Shin Dong-hyuk’s <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/prominent-n-korean-defector-shin-dong-hyuk-admits-parts-of-story-are-inaccurate/2015/01/17/fc69278c-9dd5-11e4-bcfb-059ec7a93ddc_story.html\">recent admission</a> that parts of his bestselling memoir are false did little to dampen belief in its credibility; and in May, Seoul’s Daily NK ran a discreet post contradicting CNN’s widely publicised story about Kim Jong-un’s poisoned aunt, stating Kyong-hui is alive in Pyongyang.<br /></p> \n<p>The truth about North Korea is also a casualty when politics come into play. On 30 December 2014, when independent cyber analysts announced that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/dec/30/sony-hack-researchers-claim-sacked-employees-could-be-to-blame\">disgruntled employees, not Kim Jong-un</a>, were behind the Sony hack, the FBI had already found North Korea guilty. Senator John McCain labeled the hack an “act of war”; Sony released<em> </em>The Interview<em> </em>with President Obama’s blessing<em>; </em>North Korea’s limited internet capabilities were mysteriously “blacked out” in an unattributed strike; and, by 2 January 2015, the US had imposed new sanctions on North Korea and was considering reinstating it as a “state sponsor of terrorism”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63e6406dd772691b307164e8737ef62493251e40\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/63e6406dd772691b307164e8737ef62493251e40/0_0_1202_721/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dead or alive: Kim Jong-un holding a baby with defence minister Hyon Yong-chol circled in the background, who has been reported executed. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dead or alive: Kim Jong-un holding a baby with defence minister Hyon Yong-chol circled in the background, who has been reported executed. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YONHAP/AAP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Why does all this matter?

The country is poor, but not everyone is starving or in chains: an estimated 100,000 North Koreans are imprisoned, with a further 8.3m lacking adequate food and shelter. The remaining 16.6m rely on a growing black market economy and lead “normal” enough lives to go to the movies.</p> \n<p>Vice’s popular claim that North Korea <a href=\"http://www.vice.com/video/north-korean-film-madness-1\">no longer makes films</a> is false: Pyongyang’s five studios produce 20 to 30 rom-coms, thrillers, dramas, animations and documentaries a year. The film stars, directors and writers I met had never heard of Stanley Kubrick, but loved Bend it Like Beckham, The Sound of Music and Avatar<em>.</em> Like their southern cousins, they were resilient, warm and loved telling jokes, mostly about the Russians and Chinese.

The Kims are considered too holy to physically depict on screen. A North Korean actor once had plastic surgery to portray founding founder Kim Il-sung in the drama, Star of Korea, then was permanently reassigned to a behind-the-scenes production role<em>. </em>Reports now assert the actor was sent to the gulags.

Part of my background reading for this, her third book, involved discovering, and falling in love with, her debut, <em>The Bluest Eye</em> (1970), and its successor, <em>Sula</em> (1973). Since then, I have followed most of Morrison’s subsequent fiction, notably <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/beloved.html\" title=\"\"><em>Beloved</em></a> and <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/jazz-8.html\" title=\"\"><em>Jazz</em></a>, but I remain a diehard fan of the novel that established her name. From 1977 on, she only grew in stature as a contemporary writer of extraordinary power and vision, ultimately becoming, in 1993, the first African-American woman to win the Nobel prize for literature.</p> \n<p><em>Song of Solomon</em> blazed that trail. It was the first book by a black American woman writer to be chosen as a main selection of the all-powerful Book of the Month Club, a recognition unknown to the black community since Richard Wright’s <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/native-son.html\" title=\"\"><em>Native Son</em></a> (1940).</p> \n<p><em>Song of Solomon</em> takes off, and finally comes back to earth, with an exhilarating leap of danger. The idea of “fly” and “flight” (as an escape, or challenge) runs through the story of Macon “Milkman” Dead III, who gets his nickname from being breastfed into childhood by his dominant mother.</p> \n<p>“Who am I ?” is a central premise of many classic novels in this series, including <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/dec/30/david-copperfield-dickens-100-best-novels\" title=\"\"><em>David Copperfield</em></a> (No 15) and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/feb/24/100-best-novels-huckleberry-finn-twain\" title=\"\"><em>The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</em></a> (No 23). From the arresting first scene of an insurance agent’s suicidal leap, to the closing pages, when Milkman hurls himself into the air against his best friend and nemesis, Guitar, the novel traces Milkman’s coming of age as an African American in search of a better understanding of his heritage. To achieve this, in a telling reversal of traditional black migration, Milkman makes his way to the warm and nurturing south from the frozen and alienating north.</p> \n<p>The novel is partly set in an unspecified Michigan town, and the unfolding story, replete with buried treasure, violent deaths and slavery tales, moves steadily south to Pennsylvania, where Milkman’s grandfather had died, and finally to Shalimar in Virginia, the home of his slave ancestors. In the words of the song that Milkman sings:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <em>Solomon done fly, Solomon done gone </em> \n <br /> \n <em> Solomon went across the sky, Solomon gone home. </em> \n <br /> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Where, in the first and northern half of the novel, Milkman battles his origins, in the south he embraces them, and by the end is at one with his roots.</p> \n<p><em>Song of Solomon</em> is full of characters, especially Milkman’s mysterious sister, Pilate, whose symbolic lives play an important role in the weaving of Morrison’s narrative. The story loops and swoops, in its evocation of the black American experience in the 20th century, expressing a complex literary surface in a musical and often poetic language that’s infused with the rhythms of African American speech and song. Morrison has acknowledged that <em>Song of Solomon</em> liberated her from traditional models in her writing. In a style she would perfect in novels such as <em>Beloved</em>, Morrison conjures her tale from many voices and stories. The overall effect is a kaleidoscope of many gorgeous colours and patterns, evocative of memory and history, and actualised through the compelling figure of Macon Dead, one of the great characters of contemporary American fiction.</p> \n<h2><strong>A note on the text </strong></h2> \n<p>In her “Forward” to the Vintage edition, Morrison writes that she used to despise “artists’ chatter about muses – ‘voices’ that could speak to them and enable a vision, the source of which they could not otherwise name… I regarded the ‘mystery’ of creativity as a shield erected by artists to avoid articulating, analysing, or even knowing the details of their creative process – for fear it would fade away.”</p> \n<p>She goes on: “Writing <em>Song of Solomon</em> destroyed all that.” She describes how her late father became her “muse”, how his voice was absorbed into her writing, and how the challenge of the novel became the management of “a radical shift in imagination from a female locus to a male one”.</p> \n<p>This use of voices has enabled her, writes Morrison, to break away from what she identifies as “a totalising view”. For Morrison, American literature has become “totalised – as though there is only one version. We are not one indistinguishable block of people who always behave the same way… I try to give some credibility to all sorts of voices, each of which is profoundly different. Because what strikes me about African-American culture is its variety.”</p> \n<p><em>Song of Solomon</em> was Morrison’s first step down a road that would become increasingly original and would lead her to the achievements and mastery of <em>Jazz</em> and <em>Beloved</em>.</p> \n<h2><strong>Three more from Toni Morrison </strong></h2> \n<p><em>The Bluest Eye</em> (1970); <em>Beloved</em> (1987); <em>Jazz</em> (1992).</p> \n<p><em>Song of Solomon is available in Vintage (&pound;8.99). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/song-of-solomon.html\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order it for &pound;7.19</em></a><em> </em></p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432209740465/100-novels-toni-morrison-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Toni Morrison: 'I try to give some credibility to all sorts of voices… What strikes me about African-American culture is its variety.'

I’m nine years into a teaching career and the mental exhaustion at times is overwhelming. But this year has been the worst by far. I’ve been constantly under scrutiny and made to feel like nothing I ever do is good enough. </p> \n<p>Around this time last year, my headteacher announced our classes for the year; once again, I had the class that other teachers spoke of with much disdain and damnation, as if they were almost feral. Having been at the school for two years, I knew that this wasn’t the case – the children just needed a firm set of consistent boundaries and expectations. I was up for the challenge. Looking back, I would not change my students for the world. I would change their parents, however.</p> \n<p>In September, we took the year group on an outward-bound activity day. The weather, rather predictably, took a turn for the worst, with gale-force winds and torrential downpours. Nevertheless, the children had a great time. Back at school the next day, I was asked to call a particular parent who had reported he was unhappy with the trip. Somewhat curious, I called to hear his complaint, which was about the weather. He had already called the activity centre complaining for 45 minutes to them. When I asked what he would like me to do, he stated that I needed to guarantee there would be better conditions when we returned to the centre. I said I had no control over this, but was rather fiercely told it “was not good enough”. I placated him as much as possible then, shaking my head in disbelief, I returned to class thinking little of it. He has since complained about the weather again; this time it was too hot at lunchtime.</p> \n<p>I would like to say that such a ludicrous complaint was a one-off but that would be lying. This was just one of the 30-plus complaints I have received from parents over the year so far. Others include annoyance that a train was delayed on the return journey of a trip, a child not understanding a joke in a play, the school rulers not being transparent, a child being too tired after school (having played in a football tournament all weekend), there being too many girls in my class (16 girls and 14 boys) and my not being aware that one girl got her period on a school day.</p> \n<p>During the earlier part of the year I was taken ill, signed off school for the best part of a term and nearly hospitalised. I had weekly doctor’s appointments, scans and blood tests. Seriously unwell, I was sleeping for up to 18 hours a day, needing naps after completing tasks such as making lunch, having a shower or getting dressed.</p> \n<p>After a month or so, I was advised to do little bursts of activity to build up my energy levels. A few times, such as when getting new prescriptions or groceries, parents from the school saw me (the joys of living locally). From the reaction, you would have thought they’d seen a fugitive on the run. I clearly looked unwell and was obviously in pain, but each time I was asked personal questions about the nature of my illness and when I would be back.</p> \n<p>I felt invaded. Sensitivity and respect fell completely by the wayside. I even received Facebook messages from parents of pupils in other classes. Now that the rumours about teachers’ year groups for next year have started, I have had parents saying they do not want their child in my class if I am going to be ill again.</p> \n<p>I’m not alone either. Other colleagues, in my school and elsewhere, have received complaints ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous, such as the teacher’s name being too hard (or foreign) for the child to say; demands that if girls have to tie their hair back then so should adults; and claims that there wasn’t enough food in a boy’s packed lunch. I have heard tales of shopping being rifled through in supermarket trolleys, screenshots of perfectly innocent years-old Facebook pictures being shared around the playground, and teachers being so harassed on nights out that they have to leave. </p> \n<p>For the most part in my career, I have met very positive parents who are respectful and supportive – this particular cohort of parents were already notorious for grumbling about anything and everything, regardless of whether we had control over it. Nor do I think parents shouldn’t be able to complain – it’s certainly right that they should when necessary. However, throughout this year, I’ve been astonished by the nature of some complaints and I feel that my current class’s parents just see me as the enemy.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/teacher-network/2015/apr/28/five-best-apps-teachers-communicate-parents\">Five of the best apps that help teachers communicate with parents</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I love my job, but it is hard, and sometimes made harder by such behaviours from parents.

He is there in front of their eyes and set out on his course in a very&nbsp;similar context to the one facing the potential Labour leaders. He is none&nbsp;other than the newly elected prime minister.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/27/labour-spain-podemos-winning-streak-inspiring-people\">The British left must learn to speak a&nbsp;new language – Spanish | Owen Jones</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I do not mean they should adopt the policies of David Cameron, but there are lessons to be learned from his leadership, ones that are rarely explored. Indeed I was struck by how little focus there has been on Cameron as a leader when watching a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b05szd2c/election-2015-gresham-college-lecture\" title=\"\">lecture from the constitutional historian, Vernon Bogdanor, on the 2015 election</a>. Of his many thought-provoking observations, Bogdanor notes that Cameron is too easily underestimated. The Tory leader has “seen off” Brown, Miliband, Clegg and Cable while being the first modern serving prime minister to increase his party’s share of the vote.</p> \n<p>We should not get overexcited, and Bogdanor does not. It is equally easy to overestimate Cameron, or rather the strength of Cameron’s position. Cameron’s senior advisers do not do so. While relishing the unexpected opening-up of political space, they know there is unavoidable <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/29/cameron-france-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">trouble ahead over Europe</a>, wonder whether they will have majorities for key legislative items and what will happen to their proposals in the Lords.</p> \n<p>But look back to what Cameron inherited in 2005 when he became the party’s leader. There was still quite a lot of talk about whether the Conservatives could ever win again, hyperbolic speculation now directed towards Labour. Compare such talk when Cameron became leader with the Queen’s speech delivered last week, one&nbsp;crammed with radical proposals rooted firmly on the right and&nbsp;projected&nbsp;as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/27/queens-speech-eu-referendum-bill-human-rights-act-david-cameron\" title=\"\">“one&nbsp;nation” Toryism</a>.</p> \n<p>Like Cameron in 2005, the next Labour leader will face a prime minister who will not fight the general election, and with an electoral mountain to climb. For Labour the parallels are much&nbsp;closer than they are to Blair’s early days. When he became leader in 1994 the Conservatives were in disarray and Blair knew he would be facing an already weakened John Major at the general election.</p> \n<p>Here are some of the underexplored strengths of Cameron’s leadership. At&nbsp;the beginning he deployed a brilliant phrase to suggest change while remaining ideologically in tune with a party on the right. He declared that “there is such a thing as society, but it is not the same as the state”. What appeared to be a rebuke to Margaret Thatcher was in fact a more human way&nbsp;of making the same arguments she had made. Language is extremely important in politics, a weapon. The recalibration of a familiar argument gave Cameron an audience in places that&nbsp;extended beyond his party. Miliband’s talk of “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2012/sep/12/ed-miliband-predistribution\" title=\"\">predistribution</a>”, “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2011/nov/17/miliband-cameron-change-course-economy\" title=\"\">predatory capitalism</a>” or a “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/03/ed-milibands-carved-pledges-could-sink-like-a-stone\" title=\"\">better plan</a>” was not an equivalent weapon.</p> \n<p>While Cameron looked outward well beyond his party, noting a potential ally in Nick Clegg well before the hung parliament in 2010, he ensured some of&nbsp;his leading Tory radicals were pulling&nbsp;the policy levers. The levers were aimed at what one of the pullers described to me as “reheated Thatcherism”. But Cameron would never put it like that in his engaging, emollient public performances.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The levers were aimed at ‘reheated Thatcherism'. But Cameron would never put it like that</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>His radical lever-pullers are often hidden from view. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/oliverletwin\" title=\"\">Oliver Letwin</a> is never allowed to give interviews, but is&nbsp;more influential than ever now. When&nbsp;Michael Gove was causing trouble he was moved fleetingly behind the scenes until the election was safely won and is now back with another big reforming role, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/09/michael-gove-justice-chief-cabinet-conservatives-election\" title=\"\">at the Department of Justice</a>. This is bolder leadership compared with the new Labour era, where “reform” was narrowly and timidly defined.</p> \n<p>During Cameron’s leadership the Conservatives have become more alive as a party, impressively animated by ideas and debate. Cameron appears to be an orthodox Tory but likes having daring thinkers around him, even if they&nbsp;do not last that long.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/20/steve-hilton-privilege-chumocracy-left-elite\" title=\"\">Steve Hilton</a>, who must have given more interviews in the last fortnight than Vernon Bogdanor would have done if there had been a hung parliament, is one example. Hilton is promoting his book fizzing with ideas. In recent years Conservative party conferences have been far livelier than Labour ones, which have been deadened by fearful control freakery. The next Labour leader&nbsp;must not be frightened by internal debate. That does not mean returning to the 1980s, but the other extreme of dead unity over “on message” banalities is just as fatal.</p> \n<p>Equally important is what Cameron didn’t do. In his early years he did not spend his whole time apologising for his government’s handling of the exchange rate mechanism crisis, when he&nbsp;worked for the then chancellor, Norman Lamont. Nor, incidentally, was Margaret Thatcher asked to apologise for the three-day week when she stood for the leadership of the Conservative party in 1975, even&nbsp;though she had been&nbsp;a cabinet minister when the lights went out around the UK.</p> \n<p>The ongoing media focus on whether Labour candidates should “apologise” for their government being responsible for the global economic crash in 2008 is a trap. If Cameron or Thatcher had received similar media treatment, they would not have gone around pathetically saying sorry but found other policies and language to show how they intended to move on.</p> \n<p>Assuming the next Labour leader survives for five years, he or she will be&nbsp;facing a different Tory prime minister&nbsp;at the next general election. In&nbsp;the meantime they should take a few&nbsp;notes on how the current occupant of No&nbsp;10 led an apparently doomed party&nbsp;to power while largely sticking to&nbsp;its ideological course.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Steve Richards presents <a href=\"http://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on-book-tickets/spoken-word/rock-n-roll-politics-the-post-election-special#.VWsf3Wbd79I\" title=\"\">rock’n’roll politics at King’s Place in London on Monday 15 June at 7pm</a></p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433088515584/David-Cameron-in-Berlin-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'The Tory leader has “seen off” Brown, Miliband, Clegg and Cable while being the first modern serving prime minister to increase his party’s share of the vote.'
