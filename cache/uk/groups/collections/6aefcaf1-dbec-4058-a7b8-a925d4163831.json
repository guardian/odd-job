It’s not even that clear, but the hazy sky is as blue as it gets here. Most days, the sky is obscured by a thick blanket of smog. </p> \n<p>Baoding, a city of 10 million people, was named in February as <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-02/02/content_19466412.htm\">China’s most polluted city</a> by the <a href=\"http://english.mep.gov.cn/\">Ministry of Environmental Protection</a>, based on air pollution figures gathered for 2014. By mid-May of this year, the city had only enjoyed 16 days of air quality that could be considered “good” by the official classification.</p> \n<p>“Generally, there is smog on most days,” says Mr Han, aged 66, who has lived in Baoding his whole life. He drives a motorbike that carries a carriage-like trailer, and parks outside the city’s main supermarket to ferry shoppers home for a small fee. “It was much better when I was young – the air was very clean,” he says. “We rarely see blue skies now.”</p> \n<p>Expecting coal stacks and factories pumping out toxic fumes, I instead see farmland whizzing past the window as I approach Baoding on the high-speed train from Beijing. Even when driving around the city, it’s not immediately obvious what causes the pollution. The outskirts are home to one coal power plant that doesn’t appear to be in use, with no sign of workers and not a wisp of smoke from the big chimneys. Like an increasing number of plants in the province, it may well have been closed down as part of increased governmental anti-pollution measures.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It was much better when I was young – the air was very clean.

On these days, the smog clings to the city like a thick grey shroud, and its residents are ghost-like shadows moving through the haze. Visibility for driving is reduced and headlights and traffic lights glow eerily, barely visible. Air is not something you can normally taste but, on high-pollution days, there is a metallic tang that catches in the back of your throat.</p> \n<p>Despite this, many of Baoding’s residents appear hesitant to discuss the city’s new status as China’s most polluted city, and when they do, are often defensive of it. “It’s OK in Baoding,” Mr Zhu tells me, pointing to today’s unusually clear skies. He is manning a food stand outside a small restaurant; over a hot stove, he prepares thick savoury pancakes filled with vegetables. Zhu says that his version of this popular snack food is the best in the city – and although he spends hours outside every day, he is not worried about the pollution, asserting his faith that the central government is doing something to improve the situation.</p> \n<p>According to official figures, on the day I visit Baoding’s air quality is “good” , despite the fact that the level of <a href=\"http://www.airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=aqibasics.particle\">PM2.5 particles</a> – considered dangerous because they lodge deep in the lungs – is at 54 micrograms per cubic metre, more than double the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/\">maximum daily levels recommended by the World Health Organisation</a>.</p> \n<p>Baoding is located in the north-eastern province of Hebei, China’s pollution “ground zero” which is home to seven of the 10 cities that are ranked worst in the country for air pollution. Surrounding Beijing and with its industries centred in coal and steel, Hebei gets the blame for many of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2014/dec/16/beijing-airpocalypse-city-almost-uninhabitable-pollution-china\">the Chinese capital’s headline-grabbing “airpocalypses”</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c4e67b46f9ec4b5138235099e3a3e26bba1b4930\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432140408108/bf1a7763-2249-4b78-847b-c8739422816b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"March 2014: a man looks on as a bulldozer piles up garbage to burn on the outskirts of Baoding.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">March 2014: a man looks on as a bulldozer piles up garbage to burn on the outskirts of Baoding.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: China Stringer Network/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pollution has become a controversial topic in China in recent months. In March, a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/chinas-choice/2015/mar/02/viral-china-pollution-film-is-brave-personal-and-powerful\">hard-hitting documentary, Under the Dome</a>, outlining the gravity of the country’s air pollution problem – which is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2013/dec/12/china-coal-emissions-smog-deaths\">estimated to cause the premature deaths</a> of hundreds of thousands of people each year – went viral online. The hour-long film, directed by journalist Chai Jing, has been compared to Al Gore’s 2006 film on global warming, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2006/sep/17/documentary.algore\">An Inconvenient Truth</a>, and was viewed online more than 200 million times before being censored and removed.</p> \n<p>Duan Chao, a doctor at a traditional Chinese medicine hospital in Baoding, confirms that he sees more patients during bouts of smog. “More people come when the air is not good,” he says. “There are more patients with breathing difficulties, people with coughs.” A traditional medicine called <em>ban lan gen</em> is used to treat respiratory illnesses when the smog is bad. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3194af661f7a1307599d52b706bd98fa6f06639f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432140685744/69d1f563-5b06-4db9-859f-6d3946cf2c3e-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Solar panels on street lights in Baoding.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Solar panels on street lights in Baoding.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Duggan</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Duan says that awareness is rising in Baoding about air pollution. He takes a mask out of his pocket that he carries with him at all times. While a number of people are spotted wearing face masks, they are generally flimsy and loose fitting, or are surgical masks, which offer little or no protection against most pollutants. In main cities like Beijing and Shanghai, specialist face masks are widely on sale and many homes have air purifiers – but in Baoding, none of the people I interviewed had one at home.</p> \n<p>The great irony here is that, in 2010, Baoding was named as a pilot of <a href=\"http://www.china.org.cn/environment/opinions/2009-05/05/content_17722685.htm\">China’s new project to introduce low-carbon zones</a>: an ambitious plan to use renewable energies to illuminate streets and heat residential buildings. As a result, the city has become a <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/baoding-greenest-carbon-positive-city-in-the-world-2011-6?IR=T\">hub for renewable energy companies</a>, including Yingli Solar, one of the world’s largest photovoltaic manufacturers. </p> \n<p>Yingli is based in a massive industrial park less than 20 minutes drive from downtown Baoding. The complex seems to go on for miles, with solar panels lining the streets. A new building is under construction with walls made from solar panels; its slogan repeats Yingli’s mission to provide pollution-improving, affordable solar energy for all. </p> \n<p>At Yingli, Ma Hongha, dressed in blue overalls, heads to start her shift with two of her colleagues. “Many people in Baoding work in this industry,” Ma says, adding that it is important for the city’s economy. She is reluctant to discuss the pollution, but acknowledges it has got worse since she was a child. But, she adds, “Baoding is improving. More solar panels will mean the world will be cleaner.”</p> \n<p>The industrial area is also home to a number of manufacturers of blades for wind turbines, including Zhong Hang Huiteng Wind Power, one of the largest blade makers in the world. On the edge of the industrial park, turbine blades almost the length of a football pitch are loaded on to flatbed trucks for transportation. In total, around 170 companies related to renewable energy are located in Baoding.</p> \n<p>Yet still the mystery of the city’s pollution was unclear to me. The city doesn’t have a high concentration of industrial plants around it; there are a lot of cars on the roads and car dealerships are plentiful, but that couldn’t account for the high levels of pollution. Local residents didn’t seem to know, either, or were reluctant to discuss it, though some blamed the weather and pollution from neighbouring cities.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The great irony is that, in 2010, Baoding was named ​as ​a pilot of China’s project to introduce low-carbon ​zones</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite></cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bb4d54658eccf0a6c0ee447ef954e845b6eb99e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432140804663/1083c8a5-6e59-4717-a9a1-ace4f1808f82-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A wind turbine blade is loaded on to a flatbed truck.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wind turbine blade is loaded on to a flatbed truck.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jennifer Duggan</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was only when I came across local news reports that the cause of the city’s pollution became clearer. According to preliminary findings of an analysis carried out across Hebei, <a href=\"http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2014-03/26/content_17380202.htm\">much of Baoding’s pollution comes from coal-fired steam boiler systems</a> used in more than 100 provincial villages close to the city. These boilers are extremely polluting.<br /></p> \n<p>Tackling air pollution has become a national priority and, last year, premier Li Keqiang <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/mar/05/china-pollution-economic-reform-growth-target\">declared “war” on pollution</a>. With its economy still largely reliant on coal-fired industries such as steel and cement, Hebei province is an important battleground in that war – with its authorities faced with the difficult task of balancing economic growth and environmental welfare.</p> \n<p>Already some parts of Hebei are feeling the impact as plants are closed in an attempt to improve the smog in Beijing. The city’s Communist Party chief, Nie Ruiping, was quoted as saying: “It’s necessary to close some traditional factories to fight air pollution. We cannot sacrifice the environment to make money.” By harnessing the energy of its new industries, perhaps Baoding will not keep its unwanted new title for long. </p>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432282449231/140be3a9-5b8f-4dc6-846f-b746bb3e1e86-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Chimneys rising above the skyline of Baoding, Hebei province, some 140 km south of Beijing early on March 10, 2013.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ed Jones/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432140054471/4a4dafe5-eaab-40f8-927c-eb982fc0b174-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘There is smog on most days’: Mr Han, 66, has lived in Baoding his whole life.

In 2006 (at 43) Depp romanced 21-year-old Keira Knightley in Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest. And in 2011, he co-starred with 25-year-old Amber Heard, now his wife, in The Rum Diary. However, in 2012, 48-year-old Depp hooked up on screen with 24-year-old Bella Heathcote in Dark Shadows.

They may look like the best way to change policies, amend discriminatory practices or even determine the fate of a nation. It is for people to decide, politicians argue.</p> \n<p>But they are not always the right way to go, especially when it comes to gay rights or in fact, any minority issues. </p> \n<p>Friday’s referendum on gay marriage in Ireland has captured the world’s attention. If passed, it will make Ireland the first country to formally recognise same-sex marriage through popular vote. </p> \n<p>Win or lose, however, it is a dangerous practice and can set a precedent for other nations where public opinion might not be so enlightened or tolerant.<br /></p> \n<p>The idea that the majority can legitimise the right of a minority is fundamentally flawed. In the words of Ayn Rand, the Russian-American novelist, “individual rights are not subject to a public vote; a majority has no right to vote away the rights of a minority; the political function of rights is precisely to protect minorities from oppression by majorities.”<br /></p> \n<p>There are plenty of examples on how popular votes could have catastrophic impacts in societies if they were to be sought on minority matters. The obvious example is the issue of marriage between white and non-white people in the US. </p> \n<p>Long before the American people would approve such marriages, it was judges who struck down discriminatory laws in various parts of America. If the majority had been asked whether white people could marry black people, it would have taken decades longer for them be able to do so. In 1967 when the US supreme court deemed anti-miscegenation laws unconstitutional, the American people were not ready for that decision.</p> \n<p>“If you grew up in the 1960s and 70s, it was quite possible to know adults then who said things like ‘I’m all for civil rights. But marriage between Negroes and whites? I don’t know.’ You might have been utterly baffled, but there it was,” wrote <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/05/21/wedding-bells\">Margaret Talbot in a 2012 issue of the New Yorker </a>magazine. </p> \n<p>She continued: “In 1968, the year after the supreme court struck down Virginia’s anti-miscegenation law, in Loving v Virginia, 72% of Americans disapproved of marriage between whites and non-whites, and only 20% approved.” In fact, it was not until 2000 that the US state of Alabama officially legalised inter-racial marriage. </p> \n<p>The majority is resistant, by nature, towards a minority. If it wasn’t for strict laws protecting minorities in the UK, for instance, what will guarantee that a Muslim female student would be to tolerated to wear hijab in school because of her religious affiliation? The majority would probably have never accepted that. In Iran, where Jews are in a minority, Jewish students would probably have had to go to school on Saturdays which is Sabbath, a religious holiday, if the state had not intervened.</p> \n<p>Many countries are looking closely on how Irish people will vote on Friday. There are nations who want to follow suit. Whereas Europeans, Irish people included, may be ready to approve same-sex marriages, people in the Middle East or Africa are not. It will be dangerous to encourage them to go to the polls on such matters. </p> \n<p>Ireland may well vote yes in the referendum as polls suggest, if they are to be believed. However exciting it might sound to LGBT advocates, Ireland’s referendum is only indicative of what people there think. What it does not do is legitimise or delegitime gay people’s right to marry. <br /></p> \n<p>As Rachel Maddow, the televison host of the MSNBC said: “Here’s the thing about rights – they’re not actually supposed to be voted on. That’s why there’re called rights.”</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fa11e940a385aea9d1368a4266ff84d8468dce33/48_0_3377_2027/3377.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2027,"width":3377,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Cathal Mcnaughton/Reuters","altText":"A restaurant displays a poster supporting the Yes vote, in the Caple Street area of Dublin in Ireland May 18, 2015.

So fuck you, Mad Men, you phoney grey-flannel-suit, male-chauvinist, no-talent, Wasp, white-shirted, racist, antisemitic Republican SOBs!”<br /></p> \n<p>His view of the initial episodes was pretty much universal among the 50 or so advertising folk from 1960s Madison Avenue I interviewed for my book, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2011/aug/07/real-mad-men-andrew-cracknell\">The Real Mad Men</a>. But they were a very specific and non-representational group, from the 10% or so of the business that formed the so called “Creative Revolution”. This was a bunch of renegade creative people rebelling against the advertising world as it then was and trying to change it from within. George’s and their problem with Mad Men was, I think, that it was all <em>too</em> real – and it reminded them of everything they hated about the business as they had found it. Their error was… they were blaming the messenger.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/gallery/2012/mar/27/real-mad-men-60s-ads\">The real Mad Men: ads from the heyday of Madison Avenue</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Mad Men wasn’t about them; it was about the overwhelming bulk of the advertising business, a business that behaved in exactly the way the series portrays it. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Attitudes, client behaviour, a dry witty cynicism (I’ve met Roger Sterling types at least 10 times in my career), Peggy’s trajectory, career development – or not – hierarchical behaviour, professional relationships, finance, or scenes like the all-night session to prepare for the breakaway agency – all are almost uncannily spot on. From huge issues, such as the atmosphere around the loss of a major client, to trivial incidents, such as spats between art directors and copywriters, creative contempt for account people – and for everything to do with McCann Erickson – or petty jealousies in creative reviews: everything is spot on.</p> \n<p>Wider historical accuracy, too, is impeccable. Early on, Don discusses a VW ad saying: “I don’t know what I hate about it most – the ad or the car.” It would have been much easier for the writers to have had him praise it – in 2000, it was voted as part of the greatest print campaign ever written. But the series was faithful to the time; Don’s view was the overwhelmingly prevailing attitude, the campaign representing a whole new departure in advertising that was initially deeply misunderstood. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojtMtIyD6dM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojtMtIyD6dM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  “Honesty - it’s a great angle”\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another example was a brief, apparently inconsequential, exchange at a bar between Roger and Don some time in 1962. A propos of nothing in particular, Roger says: “BBDO have just hired their first negro. What do you think of that?” Don thinks for a moment and then says: “I think I wouldn’t want to be that negro.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Apart from being a cracking piece of dialogue, I was utterly thrilled when I found out BBDO <em>had</em> hired their first (well, actually second) African American executive, and it <em>was</em> in 1962. <a href=\"https://bradley.edu/academic/departments/communication/news/story.dot?id=a830bdd8-fe10-4843-9734-350d4c72fba3\">His name is Doug Alligood</a>, and remarkably, at least until two years ago, he’s still there.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>These accuracies, big and small, and the intriguing but again, utterly authentic twists in the agency story, began to warm the initial sceptics. In 2010, Mike Tesch, an art director who worked at Carl Ally at the time said: “I hated it – and now I love it.”<br /></p> \n<p>But for the belligerent Lois, its original sin can never be eradicated. “A soap opera placed in the setting of a glamorous office where stylish fools hump their appreciative, coiffured secretaries, suck up martinis and smoke themselves to death as they produce dumb lifeless advertising …”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>He’s right – and wrong to be angry.

Even though you can’t understand the lyrics in about 25% of it (the nonsensical guy yelling is actually a sample from an obscure 1940s recording of prisoners by folk archivist Alan Lomax), the track’s tropical vibes come courtesy of David Guetta and make it the perfect complement to a day at the beach. While Hey Mama was originally released as part of Guetta’s album Listen in November, it smartly wasn’t given traction as a single until the weather started to heat up. There’s no telling if it’ll have the legs to be considered the song of the summer, but one person who’ll be watching closely is pop songstress Bebe Rexha. While her vocals sound indistinguishable from Minaj’s, Rexha is actually the one belting out the chorus (“Banging the drum like dum-diddy-day, I like the dirty rhythm you play”), but perplexingly went uncredited.

How the hell are you supposed to do a crow pose on the dancefloor?

But it’s not really about downward dogs, is it? Her new protege, Jidenna, gets a neat guest rap but otherwise it’s Queen Mon&aacute;e in a crown singing about flexing how she wants to, being her “own private dancer” and slipping words never before heard in club tunes into club tunes.

A powerhouse dance ditty without being overpowering, Lean On has many of the hallmarks for song of the summer status – from sultry lyrics you can sing along to provided by Danish singer M&Oslash; to a catchy hook. The genius of Lean On is similar to its success on the charts which caught many by surprise. After reaching the No 1 spot in a majority of the world, Lean On may have peaked too soon to be considered song of the summer, but perhaps it’ll find a way to break through.

Forget dodging her phone calls and walking a different route to the gym in order to avoid confrontations, she wants her moolah back and will turn your mum’s house into the final scene from Scarface if it doesn’t happen, pronto.

Portland’s Unknown Mortal Orchestra have then written the most modern of disco mantras, deepened by the revelation that the blurry lyrics are actually about UMO Ruban Nielson and his wife’s polyamorous relationship with a girl he met on tour, and waiting to hear from her once she moved away. Beyond its cosmic longing, though, what Can’t Keep Checking My Phone has is lithe, lip-curling, falsetto-funk groove (yeah, I said it, <em>groove</em>). It’s giving someone in a wraparound bandana the eye at a festival. It’s tripping in the woods and rolling around on a Pendleton blanket. It’s Get Lucky, if Get Lucky was made by three acid-spangled guys with illuminati tattoos and tribal necklaces with a thing for Syd Barrett records.

Never has someone made lyrics about “hot spots” and “all night wining” sound so utterly wholesome, and it follows his similarly mobile-happy track <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gl1CsAdfaLk\">Text Message</a>, during which he berates a potential partner’s terrible spelling.

We try road bikes from Canyon, Rose and Planet X</p>","byline":"Peter Walker","body":"<p>In this era of internet shopping we buy a lot of things without seeing them first. Books, electronic gizmos, even clothes and shoes. But bikes? Can you really decide on a bike – especially a flashy carbon fibre-framed one costing north of &pound;1,000 – without first having a test ride?</p> \n<p>The answer is yes, and a lot of people do. There’s a few reasons. Firstly, if you already own a bike of roughly the same style you can compare the frame dimensions and angles and have a pretty good guess at what might work. Also, the fiddly elements – stem length, saddle adjustment etc – can be amended or swapped without too much fuss. Then, as with most internet shopping, if you get the frame size wrong you can return the whole bike, albeit in a very big box. Finally, the internet is awash with bike reviews, giving an impression of how a particular model feels, its strengths and quirks. </p> \n<p>But most of all, people buy bikes over the internet because it can bring astonishing value for money. A series of web-only bike brands have sprung up over recent years, eschewing the cost of showrooms or retailer mark-ups to offer significantly more bike for your cash. </p> \n<p>Overall, is it worth it? I decided to see by testing out road bikes from three predominantly web-only marques (all do have showrooms, but only one or a handful, so of little use to most customers). </p> \n<p>The plan was to focus on bikes costing about &pound;1,000. However, the limited availability of test machines in my size meant they ended up that bit more posh, a hardship I endured as best I could.</p> \n<p>In each case I tried to act as much as possible as a paying customer, browsing the size guides on the websites and deciding on a frame and stem I thought best. Overall, it worked pretty well. With two of the three bikes the fit was perfect, and with the third I was almost exactly between frame sizes anyway, so even a brief test ride might not have helped.</p> \n<p>These are, on the face of it, broadly similar bikes, all with carbon frames, and featuring components from industry behemoths Shimano or Sram. But they are very different to ride.</p> \n<p>Finally, the usual caveats apply. I’m not arguing that anyone, let alone everyone, “needs” an expensive, high-tech road bike. That 30-year-old steel-framed clunker you rescued from a skip (or, as in my case, a &pound;150 second-hand Dutch bike) might be perfectly fine for everyday needs. But the bikes below are generally used for longer-distance sport or leisure riding. Yes, &pound;1,500 is a lot for a bike, but not so much when compared with, say, a car, or a jet ski. It’s all relative.</p> \n<p>I’m listing the bikes purely in the order I tested them, not as any sort of league table.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en/roadbikes/bike.html?b=3501\">Canyon Endurace CF 8.0</a> - &pound;1,299</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d266145c54c9436ea554b233be540ccd7fcf998\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432227243484/52799b78-80a8-4991-93cf-bebbd7de0973-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Canyon Edurace bike\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Canyon Endurace CF 8.0.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Canyon</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite their anglicised name, Canyon are based in the German city of Koblenz. As with all the bikes tested here, while they’re designed by the company, the frames are manufactured in Asia, in this case Taiwan. Canyon’s top-end bikes are used by two top-level professional teams, Movistar and Katusha, and if you have more than &pound;3,000 burning a hole in your bank account <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en/outlet/original-pro-bikes/list.html\">you can ride an identical machine</a>.</p> \n<p>The model I tried out is a bit less gung ho. The Endurace, as the name suggests, is designed more for long-distance comfort as flat-out sprinting, more specifically the sportive, those often long but generally relaxed one-day events increasingly popular with road bike riders.</p> \n<p>Canyon have a <a href=\"https://www.canyon.com/en/tools/pps.html\">flashy gizmo on their website</a> to gauge your perfect bike size from body measurements you enter. This told me I needed a large frame, which sounded too big for my 5ft 10ins. Guessing the result might have been skewed by the fact my tape measure assistant was my four-year-old son, I instead went for a medium, or 56cm, frame, which was perfect.</p> \n<p>As with many modern carbon bikes, the Endurance frame is shaped in all sorts of clever ways, some parts large and super-stiff so your pedalling power is transmitted efficiently, others slim and reed-like, to make the ride that bit less bone shaking.</p> \n<p>Further increasing the comfort level are 25mm-thick <a href=\"http://www.conti-tyres.co.uk/conticycle/ti_GP4000SII.shtml\">Continental GP 4000s tyres</a> – if there was ever a Nobel prize for bike tyres these would surely win – and a space age-looking split carbon seatpost, which works as a sort of leaf spring.</p> \n<p>Overall, you get a lot of of bike for your &pound;1,300. On to a &pound;900 list price frameset go some <a href=\"http://www.dtswiss.com/Wheels/Road-Wheels/R-24-Spline\">fairly posh DT Swiss wheels</a> and an 11-speed <a href=\"http://cycle.shimano-eu.com/publish/content/global_cycle/en/nl/index/components/road/105_5700.html\">Shimano 105 groupset</a>. Even the tyres would officially set you back &pound;80 a pair.</p> \n<p>The effect is quite magical – one of the most intuitive, trustworthy and comfortable lightweight road bikes you can imagine. I tried the Canyon out on a <a href=\"http://www.srs-events.cc/event1/event-details.htm\">sopping wet, hilly, 70-mile April sportive</a>, on back roads sufficiently covered in muck to leave the new brake pads half-flat by the end. </p> \n<p>Throughout it all the bike didn’t flinch or falter, with every corner handled confidently, every gear change a satisfyingly precise click. Almost as notable was how the bike felt nearer home. Carbon-frame bikes are known for being forgiving, but the Canyon made the rutted, potholed south London roads feel as close to comfortable as you’ll get on such a machine.</p> \n<p>With all this comes some compromise. By most standards the Canyon is super light – a claimed weight without pedals of about 7.5kg – and very nippy. </p> \n<p>But it is built for easier riding. Mine came with a relatively vast 11-32 tooth cassette, encouraging knee-friendly sit-down climbs rather than out-of-the-saddle grinds. And it is slightly if noticeably less responsive than more racy bikes. There is just not quite the same visceral connection between the force from your legs and resultant surge in speed.</p> \n<p>Does that make it less fun? That’s up to you.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.rosebikes.co.uk/bike/rose-x-lite-crs-4000/aid:753947?bikevariantchanged=753995\">Rose X-lite CRS 4000</a> - &pound;2,304</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71ba0ff6721b18fc7f7707395a2b8e54a6dd2195\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432227378761/ac48d891-8a97-4b7d-9fb0-249ac6dfe64b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rose bike\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rose X-Lite CRS-4000.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rose</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When this arrived at the office I got a call from the post room. “There’s a bike box arrived for you,” they said. “I think it’s empty.” A short pause. “Oh, hang on, there is something inside.”</p> \n<p>The mistake was understandable: this machine from another German web behemoth has a measly claimed weight of just over 6.3kg, below the legal minimum for top-end racing.</p> \n<p>To be fair, it is a more expensive bike than I’d intended, as Rose’s tiny UK operation possesses just a handful of test machines. This one was fitted with Shimano’s <a href=\"http://cycle.shimano-eu.com/publish/content/global_cycle/en/nl/index/components/road/dura_ace.html\">Dura Ace components</a>, a good &pound;1,000-worth of pro-level kit. But even the <a href=\"http://www.rosebikes.co.uk/bike/rose-x-lite-crs-3000/aid:753692\">more comparable next model down</a>, fitted with Shimano’s Ultegra and costing &pound;1,668 (Rose’s sterling prices are pegged to euro rates, hence the oddly precise numbers), weighs a mere 6.75kg.</p> \n<p>I opted for a 57cm frame with a 90mm stem, which felt comfortable if a tiny bit stretched. If I was going to buy this bike – can we pause here for a moment while I idly dream of this happening – I might go for the next size down, the 55cm, but it’s marginal.</p> \n<p>Rose don’t have the snob pedigree of Canyon, let alone of the more venerable marques, but they are known for astonishing value, as well as a website that lets you create a bespoke bike from a list of options, built for you at their cavernous facility near the German-Dutch border. </p> \n<p>On to the high-tech frame, itself weighing less than a kilo, is bolted a range of shiny kit: aside from the Dura-Ace components you get <a href=\"http://www.dtswiss.com/Wheels/Road-Wheels/R-20-DICUT\">about &pound;400 of DT Swiss wheels</a>, the same Continental tyres as the Canyon, even about &pound;175 of bling carbon fibre “monolink” seatpost and saddle. Buy a bike with this sort of kit from a high street bike chain and you’ll generally be thinking above &pound;3,000.</p> \n<p>My main try-out for this ultra-light machine was <a href=\"http://www.ukcyclingevents.co.uk/events/wiggle-ups-and-downs-sportive/\">102 hilly miles of a sportive around Surrey</a>, which was, thanks to the Rose, the most astonishing fun. Compared with the Canyon, the Rose is designed more for speed, and that’s just what you get.</p> \n<p>For all sorts of legal reasons, sportives are not officially races, but organisers often classify rider’ times into gold, silver or bronze, depending how fast you finish. The Rose led me to my first-ever gold time, which is not a coincidence.</p> \n<p>That a 6.3kg bike is nippy up hills won’t come as a shock, but it’s also hugely assured and intuitive, and still pretty comfortable. If Rose UK hadn’t needed it back very quickly I’d still be riding it now.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.planetx.co.uk/i/q/CBPXRT90CMP/planet-x-rt-90-comp-road-bike\">Planet X RT-90 Comp</a> - &pound;1,599.99</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e303f43804927b76b6f8bcea54465272dd62678\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432227474225/a75d9c59-f4e2-4d8b-9e32-e56cdcd4012e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Planet X bike\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Planet X RT-90 Comp.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Planet X</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>My plan had been to try out one of the Sheffield company’s venerable <a href=\"http://www.planetx.co.uk/c/q/bikes/road-bikes/pro-carbon\">Pro Carbon machines</a>, but the company’s founder, Dave Loughran, unexpectedly hijacked the email exchange with his press officer to insist I ride their latest, flashy offering. I tried hard to argue against him ... well, actually I said yes straight away. Loughran’s evident keenness to show off his new creation seems typical of Planet X, very much a firm run by, and for, excitable enthusiasts.</p> \n<p>The RT-90 is a cut above the &pound;1,000 <a href=\"http://www.cyclescheme.co.uk/employers/about-the-scheme\">bike to work scheme</a> specials on which Planet X made their name. It is avowedly race-based. In fact, <a href=\"http://www.planetx.co.uk/i/q/CBPXRT90TEAM/planet-x-rt-90-carnac-team-edition-road-bike\">the &pound;2,000 model</a> is the bike raced by two domestic teams kitted out by the firm.</p> \n<p>Using Planet X’s website guide, I plumped for a medium frame with a 90mm stem, and it was pretty much a perfect fit.</p> \n<p>While the Comp usually comes in a somewhat muted black and green look, as pictured above, mine had the <a href=\"http://www.planetx.co.uk/i/q/CBPXRT90TEAM/planet-x-rt-90-carnac-team-edition-road-bike\">same dayglo yellow look of the team model</a> (and slightly different wheels). Wherever I rode, it seemed, I was a beacon, both metaphorically and literally, for would-be overtakers. Being inconspicuous was not an option.</p> \n<p>Just as well, then, that the RT-90 is expressly designed to scoot you along as fast as you can possibly manage. The frame is stiff and responsive to grin-inducing levels. It might not actually make you a stronger rider, but it has a near-magical ability to hypnotise you into believing you are.</p> \n<p>On a <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/301647947\">hilly 60-mile ride through south-east London and into Kent</a> I somehow kept up with a friend who usually a fair bit quicker. As we weaved through the backmarkers of a sportive using the same roads, sprinting up the short climbs, it was about as much fun as you can have on a road bike.</p> \n<p>As a race machine, the bike comes with a fairly narrow 11-25 cassette. Being more of a spinner than a grinder I feared for myself on the steeper inclines. As it turned out, even <a href=\"http://roadcyclinguk.com/sportive/ten-uks-steepest-climbs.html/10#eEsa21pdy2AMd7ey.97\">York’s Hill in Kent</a> with it’s maximum 25% gradient, proved possible.</p> \n<p>Like the other two test machines the RT-90 is exceptionally well kitted out, this time with a <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/sram/road/family/sram-force\">Sram Force groupset</a>, officially costing a good &pound;700 on its own. I felt genuinely sad when I had to pack up the bike to send it back to Sheffield. It’s that much fun.</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432227601225/ca636885-55df-43dc-b378-c914650a6572-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sportive Photo Ltd","altText":"Peter Walker tests Rose bike","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sportive Photo Ltd"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432227244872/5d2a807b-4ecc-44d7-9050-a8cb59c97770-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Canyon Endurace CF 8.0.
