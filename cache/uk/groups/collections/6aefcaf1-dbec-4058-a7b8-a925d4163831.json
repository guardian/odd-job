a record deal</p>","byline":"Agence France-Presse","body":"<p>They joke about knocking on heaven’s door, but a Japanese ‘girl band’ with an average age of 84 have struck a blow for grannies everywhere by becoming pop idols.<br /></p> \n<p>Hailing from the remote, coral-fringed island of Kohama in Okinawa, KBG84 – a play on the name of saccharine teeny boppers AKB48 – admit to being slightly bemused by their success after cutting their first disc and completing a sellout Japan tour.</p> \n<p>“When I first heard someone call us ‘idols’ I thought an idol meant someone who had lived a long life and was at the gates of heaven,” pint-sized diva Tomi Menaka, 92, told AFP in a herb garden overlooking Kohama’s turquoise sea. </p> \n<p>“But in Tokyo they told me it was an entertainer – which was a relief because I thought it meant I was on my way to heaven,” she added, picking up steam as her fellow group members collapsed in fits of giggles. “I hadn’t even been to Tokyo or Osaka. I wanted to go there before I went to heaven.”</p> \n<p>The 33-strong troupe of singers and dancers has released a single called “Come on and Dance, Kohama Island”, with a heart-warming video shot on the tiny honeymoon isle, which has a population of just 600 and lies a mere 150 miles (240 kms) off Taiwan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hai03j7l0NM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hai03j7l0NM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  KBG84 in action\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Normally hunched over a walking stick, Menaka tosses her cane aside like a bona fide rock star when she’s on stage, dancing with joyous abandon to the pling-plang of traditional Okinawan string music given a Tokyo-style pop makeover.</p> \n<p>“I’ve never been as happy as I am when we perform,” she said, wearing a stripy kimono and flame-red headscarf, her gold teeth glistening in the midday sun. </p> \n<p>“Going to Tokyo for the first time, I thought I was so lucky to be born. I got to meet my grandchildren. I’ll never forget it. I was moved to tears.”</p> \n<p>Okinawan islanders have one of the highest life expectancies in the world, their diet containing more vegetables and less sugar than that of mainland Japanese, the staple food the purple-fleshed local sweet potato rather than rice. </p> \n<p>Menaka, a queen bee of the group, which has a minimum age requirement of 80, stays fit by doing housework. But she is not particularly fussy about her diet.</p> \n<p>“I like meat and sweet things,” she cackled, flanked by the group’s eldest member, 97-year-old Haru Yamashiro, who shook her head disapprovingly.<br /></p> \n<p>“I look after my health by cleaning my home, wiping the floors, steaming rice. I stay in the shade when it’s too hot. I don’t want to tan. I have to take care of my skin – I’m still young at heart!”</p> \n<p>While they tweak the nose of old age with their indefatigable girl power, backstage at a KBG84 gig is <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/glastonbury-2015\">a far cry from Glastonbury</a> – walking frames block entrances, and blood pressure monitors and defibrillators are close at hand. </p> \n<p>The brainchild of Kyushu-born musician Kikuo Tsuchida, who has lived on Kohama for over 20 years, the rambunctious seniors recently signed a record deal and have been followed by Japanese documentary crews as they play to audiences, generally from middle-age upwards.</p> \n<p>“We felt like stars in Tokyo,” said 86-year-old Hideko Kedamori. “Everyone in the audience had a big smile, which gave us the energy to sing our hearts out. We’re blessed to have been born in Kohama. Our lyrics are about the island and nature – whales in the sea spouting or dolphins doing somersaults.” </p> \n<p>Life in paradise has barely changed for the geriatric pop queens, who still enjoy long chats over a cup of tea and compare themselves to musketeers.</p> \n<p>“We still sit around gossiping about life,” said Kedamori. “If we fight, we quickly make up again, just like when we were kids. We are all together with the same heart. All for one and one for all.”</p> \n<p>The diminutive Menaka, as usual, has the final word.</p> \n<p>“I want to go back to Tokyo with the grannies and see my grandchildren before I go to heaven,” she said with a toothy grin.</p> \n<p>As her colleagues rolled their eyes and warned it would be impossible to stop her once in full flow, Menaka smiled and stared wistfully out to sea, before adding: “That would be just grand.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/596ab5fcd3497e0f79d866206bcc928e5a528b95/0_42_3701_2221/3701.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2221,"width":3701,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Toru Yamanaka/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"To go with AFP story Japan-lifestyle-music-elderly,FEATURE by Alastair HIMMER\nIn this picture taken on June 22, 2015, an elderly women troupe of singers and dancers from Kohama Island in Okinawa wearing traditional local costumes perform at a herb garden on Kohama Island, Okinawa Prefecture.

But, now he’s starring as an ant-sized superhero, is he about to reinvent himself as a blockbuster superstar?","byline":"Hadley Freeman","body":"<p>It is almost two decades to the day since Paul Rudd first came to public attention and two things about him have remained unchanged since. The first, most obviously, is his face. Save for some faint lines on his forehead, Rudd looks unnervingly similar to how he did in Clueless, which celebrates its 20th anniversary next week and in which he played the love interest Josh.&nbsp;So much so that his lifelong friend Jon Hamm has suggested this is&nbsp;down to <a href=\"http://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a11741/paul-rudd-interview/\" title=\"\">“all that crazy virgin blood he’s drinking”.</a></p> \n<p>The second is his personality: Paul&nbsp;Rudd is just so darn nice. Every interview he has done mentions this and every one of his co-stars says this about him (Amy Poehler recently described him to me in an interview as “Mr Perfect”). Last year, the American comedian Stephen Colbert dropped his carefully honed rightwing blowhard persona on The Colbert Report to talk seriously about how Rudd is “the nicest person on the planet”, describing the time Rudd sang Oops! ... I Did It Again on loop with <a href=\"http://uproxx.com/tv/2014/06/stephen-colberts-chat-with-paul-rudd-is-why-hell-be-a-great-late-show-host/\" title=\"\">Colbert’s six-year-old daughter to keep her entertained</a>.</p> \n<p>“Ah, you know, he was biased. It was&nbsp;just that I was playing with his kids,” Rudd shrugs when I bring this up, as though he is offering proof that he is cheating his way to likability as&nbsp;opposed to further evidence of his&nbsp;niceness.</p> \n<p>Hollywood and audiences also tend to think of him as the ultimate nice guy – the go-to man for the safe boyfriend role. But many of Rudd’s best-known roles have involved him playing embittered cynics, such as in the underrated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SSk0B0dVq4g\" title=\"\">Role Models</a>, which he co-wrote, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYBo5eS5pW8\" title=\"\">The 40-Year-Old Virgin</a>, in which he played an unhinged ex-boyfriend, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qqe5p8S5-ws\" title=\"\">Knocked Up</a> ,as the frustrated husband Pete (“Isn’t it weird when you have a kid and all your dreams and hopes go right out the window?”). Then there are the characters Rudd describes as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDyM1I9bxM4\" title=\"\">“the full-on buffoons”</a>, such as reporter Brian Fantana in Anchorman, who gives names to his testicles and – still my favourite Rudd performance – Andy the obnoxious summer camp counsellor in cult 2001 comedy <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbPGGfPWWWk\" title=\"\">Wet Hot American Summer</a>, which is being revived on Netflix this summer, in which Rudd will co-star alongside original cast members including Poehler and Bradley Cooper. Yet such is Rudd’s shining niceness that his public image as Mr Good Guy, the perfect fantasy boyfriend, has remained unaffected by&nbsp;the roles he&nbsp;plays.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457444446__\n</div> \n<p>By the time I meet up with Rudd, he has been stuck inside an airless London hotel room doing interviews for his performance as the eponymous <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jul/08/ant-man-review-paul-rudd-michael-douglas\" title=\"\">Ant-Man</a>, the latest superhero film in Marvel’s hugely lucrative stable, for more than eight hours, starting at 7am. Yet in his trim suit and dark shirt he couldn’t look less ruffled and more psyched to&nbsp;see me, urging me to partake in refreshments (“No tea? You sure? But you must be so hot!”) and latching immediately on to my transatlantic accent. I’m not surprised that Rudd seizes on my accent – his parents were British Jews from Edgware and Surbiton, and while Rudd was born in New Jersey in 1969 and raised in the US, he was often in Britain as a kid to visit relatives in London’s less glamorous suburbs and Basingstoke.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jul/08/ant-man-review-paul-rudd-michael-douglas\">Ant-Man review: diminishing returns for latest expansion of Marvel universe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I’ve always felt genuinely at home here, just from the little things.

The world is small when you’re small, so that was HUGE,” he says, his eyes growing wide at the memory of all those Wonka-esque sweets, such as Rowntree Fruit Gums for his dad (“Never the pastilles!”), and Smarties and Crunchie bars for his younger sister and him.</p> \n<p>“I’m now getting asked about the&nbsp;comics I read as a kid [because of Ant-Man], but the comics I loved were the Beano and Dandy: Desperate Dan, the Bash Street Kids, Dennis the Menace.

Even in the bromantic comedies with which he has become synonymous, it always feels like Rudd’s character is knowingly self-mocking rather than engaging in the more bullying comedy style of his frequent co-star Seth Rogen. But Rudd puts his self-deprecation down to something more complicated than nationality. His father worked for the airline TWA and the family moved a lot, before settling in Kansas when he was 10.</p> \n<p>“I was always in new schools and had British parents, which was not the norm, and I think there was also … I’m not particularly religious, but I was born Jewish and I always felt like the outsider because I wasn’t Christian or Catholic,” he says. “So I learned early on that I could be accepted if I made people laugh when I turned the joke on&nbsp;myself and, particularly in Kansas, if I made a joke about being Jewish, my friends would laugh really hard, harder than they perhaps should have.”</p> \n<p>Yet he talks about his childhood, Kansas and, in particular, his family with enormous fondness, especially his father, who died six years ago and whom he idolised and references often&nbsp;in our time together. One of the defining memories of his younger years&nbsp;is watching his father crack up on&nbsp;the sofa while watching Monty Python, which planted the seed of him&nbsp;wanting to be a comedian and eventually an actor.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/sep/29/paul-rudd-prince-avalanche-anchorman-2\">Paul Rudd: Hollywood's most lovable man</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Actors talk about a love of craft and contributing to artistic welfare. But, really, I think [the desire to act] came for me from wanting more attention from my parents,” he says. I’d always assumed that the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9gwRjQLKfkA\" title=\"\">dorky dancing</a> that he breaks out in nearly all his films was a homage to Carlton from The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. But Rudd assures me, “There is family footage of me doing that same dance at the age of four, just to make my parents laugh.”</p> \n<p>Is his friendliness part of that desire to please or does that come from growing up in the midwest? “There is something about growing up in the midwest that gives a different kind of sensibility,” he agrees. “But if I’m feeling insecure, the smiles and politeness get upped a notch, and maybe that isn’t totally reflective of how I’m feeling on the inside. But, you know, better to be thought of as a nice person than a dickhead.” He laughs and carefully – and correctly – pours himself a cup of tea.</p> \n<p>While there might be some truth to that, the man is too sweet for it to be just a twitch of insecurity. He doesn’t even wince when he is asked – for what must be the 10 billionth time in his life – about Clueless.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"407497460a06a06349881f7a1fdb123b6a150aeb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436451142145/1ce0ac71-1066-41a3-9f26-61b5236f7b24-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"In Clueless with Alicia Silverstone\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">As the Nietzsche-reading Josh in 1995’s Clueless, with Alicia Silverstone.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Honestly, I’m just happy to be involved with something that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2015/jun/30/clueless-best-fashion-film-twenty-years-cher-horowitz\" title=\"\">struck a&nbsp;chord with as many people as it did</a>. I&nbsp;remember after we’d done the first table read and the whole cast went out to get something to eat and someone said: ‘How cool would it be if this movie is to kids now what those John Hughes movies had been to us?’ So that it turned out to be that way was just a fluke. Even the day it came out, the producer, Scott Rudin, called me and said: ‘Congratulations, we’ve got good reviews – don’t get used to this.’ Smart man,” he says.</p> \n<p>Rudd could easily have been another cute guy in a 90s film whose career faded out of view in the next decade – another Freddie Prinze Jr, say, or, at best, a Josh Charles. That he isn’t is largely thanks to two career developments in the next decade: Friends and Judd Apatow. When Rudd was cast in Friends in 2002, he had been working steadily since the 90s, including making a small&nbsp;but amusing appearance in Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Juliet, but not in anything nearly as seminal as Clueless. But Rudd is largely dismissive of his experience on Friends: “The process [of making a sitcom] seemed really foreign to me, so it’s kind of a strange memory for me. I mainly hung out in the background and talked to Gunther. It was amazing but kind of like being the Jew with English parents in Kansas – that’s the way I felt on Friends. I just didn’t want to get in the way. So as far as having an impact on my career, it was really with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/101940/anchorman\" title=\"\">Anchorman</a> and then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/107816/40-year-old-virgin\" title=\"\">The 40 Year Old Virgin</a> where I took a&nbsp;left turn.”</p> \n<p>These films certainly rejuvenated Rudd’s career, and presumably gave him the leverage to create the brilliant but too shortlived sitcom <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Party_Down\" title=\"\">Party Down</a>. But increasingly they started to look like they were trapping him. For every decent comedy in which he has appeared in the past decade, there have been plenty of meh ones (This is Forty, Our Idiot Brother) and too many terrible ones (Admission, Dinner for Schmucks, How Do You Know).</p> \n<p>“Over the last 10 years, I never made a very concerted effort to mix it up. I&nbsp;just wanted to work on things that I&nbsp;liked. But I think I was feeling some fatigue over that and wanted to try something different,” he says.</p> \n<p>Which brings us to Ant-Man. While superhero movies are now part of Hollywood’s landscape, you would go through a lot of names before getting to Rudd’s when thinking of actors you would expect to add to the superhero roster. As Rudd says himself: “I knew being in this would make people say: ‘What? Really?’” But this is partly why he works in the film – after all, a movie about a man whose special power is that he becomes ant-sized is not calling for a classic macho man (although Rudd did buff up a little for the film, a process he describes, with sweet nerdiness, as “enjoyable – it was fun to have that kind of focus”).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e4518621e27507a36aa5209c85585a82f937ba9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436451254560/fb45826e-c377-4136-a7b0-d78d63322155-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Paul Rudd in Ant-Man\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The birth of a new career?

It’s a visually sparky film, a mercifully far cry from the solemn ponderousness of too many superhero films today. But it’s hard not to wonder if much of the spark came from the film’s original director, Edgar Wright, who co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Cornish, before both were replaced at the eleventh hour by Peyton Reed as director and Rudd and Anchorman’s Adam McKay as scriptwriters. (Reed has said <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/peyton-reed-edgar-wright-ant-man/\" title=\"\">the idea for the film’s best scene, set in a child’s bedroom, came from Wright</a>). Rudd eagerly credits Wright and Cornish with “doing most of the heavy lifting” on the script, but adds that he and McKay “did a pretty substantial re-write, although we wanted to stay true to what those guys had written, but also open it up.”</p> \n<p>Does he know why Wright was let go? “I don’t, er – that’s really between Edgar and Marvel. Yeah,” he says, with a slightly nervous look towards the PR in&nbsp;the room.</p> \n<p>Whatever the truth of the story behind the film, Rudd will appear as Ant-Man in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3498820/\" title=\"\">Captain America: Civil War</a> and may well join the Avengers stable. After nailing teen romances in the 90s and fratty comedies in the earlier 2000s, the third and equally zeitgeisty part to Rudd’s career may well be beginning in superheroes. But for him, he says, the best part is that his son, who is 10, can enjoy his work for the first time (Rudd also has a young daughter and he and his family live in New York City).</p> \n<p>“This is the first film of mine that he’s seen and it makes me proud and nervous at the same time. I took him to the premiere – he’d never been to a premiere, and that was a very moving experience for me. The best thing about anything is sharing it with your kid.”</p> \n<p>Your son must think you’re pretty cool to be a superhero, I say. “Well, if I could now get a job playing with the Kansas City Chiefs or Man City, then I’d be really cool to him,” he says with a self-mocking, dorky-dad grin. Because, as he knows himself, Paul Rudd is too nice to be cool.</p> \n<p><em>Ant-Man goes on worldwide release on 17&nbsp;July.</em></p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436452920505/e50aaf50-51a1-46b3-a238-77f8cef2e053-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Action Press/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Paul Rudd","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Action Press/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436451467637/19c591d8-32d1-4434-9658-a7cc2576b4c3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"With Seth Rogen and Romany Malco in The 40-Year-Old Virgin.

While highly systemised role-playing adventures, such as Mass Effect, allow player individuality through complex character progression systems, open-world titles(Grand Theft Auto V, Far Cry, etc) accompany their backbone narrative missions with dozens of discoverable side-quests and emergent encounters. It’s always a tussle between guiding the player and just letting them go. </p> \n<p>Harvey Smith has been exploring this tension through his whole career. Back in 1993, he was QA lead on System Shock, the innovative first-person action role player that brought player choice and emergence to the fore. Later, at Ion Storm in Texas, he worked with Warren Spector on the revolutionary sci-fi shooter Deus Ex, a dizzyingly complex conspiracy thriller that offered players multiple definable roles and systems.</p> \n<p>Then, in 2008, he joined French-American studio Arkane as co-creative director, and spent three years helping to construct a brand new action adventure based around player choice and freedom. The result was Dishonored – a strange, engrossing assassination adventure set in a gloomy steampunk city overrun with rats, plague and corruption. </p> \n<p>At this year’s E3, publisher Bethesda announced that a sequel is on the way, giving players the choice between two characters: original protagonist Corvo and Emily Kaldwin, the daughter of the empress assassinated at the beginning of the first game. Set 15 years later, and after a fragile peace, Kaldwin has been deposed from her rightful throne, plunging the Empire of Isles into chaos once again – now the two leads have to regain power, taking the action away from the industrial city of Dunwall and toward the more prosperous coastal town of Karnaca.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d18c945c894dc1bafe6cc1561251a6faab91bfaa\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436445370921/1c05ad89-8ddd-422f-89ce-a2a07917f35b-460x276.png\" alt=\"Dishonored\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sequel moves the action from Dunwall to Karnaca, “a once dazzling coastal city that holds the key to restoring Emily to power.”</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bethesda</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So what did the studio want to explore when starting out on a sequel? “Dishonored was a mish-mash,” says Smith. “We wanted to make a first-person immersive game in a fantasy world with some stealth features; it was a homage to games we’d made before or loved. But, halfway through, we were only just figuring out what it was. The map, the calendar, the religion the culture – it felt really good starting the new project just knowing that stuff. On top of that we were thinking, well, our swordfighting could have been a little deeper, our stealth could have been more reliable with better feedback, and our UI was slapped together at the last minute. Just at every level there was something to deepen or extend or think about longer.” </p> \n<p>Smith was also interested in developing the character of Emily as a central, playable entity. In the first game she acts as a reflection of your actions – if you avoid violence, she’s seen painting happy pictures, if you murder everything and everyone, it’s all black crayon monsters. </p> \n<p>“So it felt like, what happened to that little girl?” says Smith. “She was born into privilege, she was marred by this terrible tragedy, and then after that she was raised by Corvo. What would she be like as a 25-year-old adult – as an empress and then an outlaw? It was effortless to find that part. </p> \n<p>“If you play as Emily it’s all new – she has her own set of powers, her own assassinations and animations, so she feels different, she feels like a finesse character. In the video, we show a power called Far Reach [a teleportation abaility] which can be upgraded in different ways, and it changes your flow through the world and your mobility. Just on a video game level, moving through the world feels different. But if you play Corvo, it’s all this classic stuff, it’s the rat swarms, it’s possession, it’s stopping time – he feels more heavy and brutal, he’s an older guy.”</p> \n<p>The beauty of Dishonored – like System Shockand Deus Ex – is the way in which the game’s multiple systems combine to give each player a very individual experience. Various powers, such as possession and limited teleportation, are unlockable as you traverse the dank streets and ruined terraces of Dunwall, and these can be utilised alongside traditional weapons in very different ways. So how does Arkane provide that sense of freedom and still tell a story that everyone gets to experience?</p> \n<p>“We argued about this on Deus Ex,” says Smith. “Some members of the team felt that each building should split, and that in one hallway all the locked doors and encounters and conflicts are all related to sneaking; then there’s a hallway here that’s all related to hacking, and another up here that’s all about fighting. The other half of the team, me included, said ‘no, what we should do is intermix those things so there’s a fluidity as you get to each situation: you can decide, am I going to deal with it this way or that way, or do I need to bypass it because I’m not skilled in that area?’”</p> \n<p>Smith brought the combination approach to Dishonored. Very little is out of bounds to the player – all the powers and runes are accessible. “It’s a hybrid,” he says. “Some teams use an unlock schedule which is much easier because you know, at level three, the guy’s never going to have possession or whatever. We don’t do that. We give you your points and say: spend them how you want. <em>You</em> decide how to put together equipment upgrades and bone charms and powers to make your own little combinations. It’s much more expensive and much harder, but it ensures it’s fluid – your choices and my choices will probably be different.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnsDyv-TtJg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UnsDyv-TtJg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The original Dishonored also allowed multiple routes through each mission location, designed to compliment different game styles. Smith says that’s definitely the case with the sequel too. But it’s not just about creating ludic worlds that engender player choice, it’s about making them seem like functioning living spaces too. “I hate to use the term realism, we look at every place to see if it’s plausible. Does it have a history? How does the guard in this room get to work? We’ve built levels before and then looked at them and said, ‘Really? The guy starts here on the terrace, then has to get to the dock, and he needs to walk a mile and up ten flights of steps? That doesn’t make any sense’. We approach it very plausibly but it’s very interconnected – you see the tower you need to get to, but your path will be different.”</p> \n<p>For Smith, the key is all about making player choice the defining experience of play. If it’s a cosmetic or trivial element that is quickly forgotten or proves irrelevant, it’s not a choice. He talks about the games he’s looking forward to – XCOM 2, Fallouot 4, No Man’s Sky – and sees that element in all of them. “The common thread seems to be, most of the time, you make decisions and you can succeed or fail or have an interesting experience or not based on the decisions you make,” he says. “The more that’s true the more I like it.

After all, they have plenty to smile about – the free houses, the free money, the free adulation, the fact there’s no chance of their kids ever having to worry about student loans, tax credits or the minimum wage. All smiles all the way. But Testino, the world’s most horrible flatterer of wealth and status, makes every smile look phoney. He makes reality itself seem a glib and cynical charade.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f0e9e9cfb4deaed5e69fc32b5267ed4df1d487ea\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f0e9e9cfb4deaed5e69fc32b5267ed4df1d487ea/538_0_4658_6987/667.jpg\" alt=\"Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and his son Prince George  by Mario Testino\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, and his son Prince George pictured after the christening of Princess Charlotte at the Sandringham Estate.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mario Testino/Art Partner via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Their faces lit up by hysterical joy, their hair wispy in the sun, their teeth shining like diamond walls of privilege, and their eyes betraying no signs of thought whatsoever, the Cambridges are robbed of true personality by Testino’s faux-honest glamour shot. Their children are so glossily celebrated that they look like fashion accessories, hired for the day. George, you can tell, is bored and hating this. He gives away the fact that, far from casually encountering Testino’s lens, the royalist antidotes to King Charles are in fact enduring the torture of a prolonged pose.</p> \n<p>They deserve better, and so do we. Testino is a bland and banal photographer whose images lack any shred of emotional depth. Time was that royalty employed actual artists, and royal portraits were more than PR exercises. If all royal families in history had been as sedulously flattered as ours is by Testino there would be no such works of art as Velazquez’s Las Meninas or Goya’s Family of Charles IV, in which royalty are revealed as mortal and fallible human beings.</p> \n<p>Testino’s pictures of Princess Charlotte’s christening – which also include a more formal group portrait with the Queen, Duke of Edinburgh, Charles and Camilla and more – in fact consciously hark back to older traditions on royal portraiture. In the background to the large group picture, painted portraits on the wall remind us that Testino’s photographs are part of a long tradition of British royal portraiture that includes such masters as Gainsborough, Reynolds and Zoffany.</p> \n<p>It is the informality and naturalness of these 18th-century painters that Testino’s royal portraiture pretends to revive. The creamy rococo colours and flamboyant dynamic motions of his royals ape the swagger and gorgeousness of Gainsborough. But in the age of powdered wigs there was more to royal art than mere propaganda.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4f88ffa5dbc841a2b508935a8c1d42a67cdcc9c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e4f88ffa5dbc841a2b508935a8c1d42a67cdcc9c/57_144_3388_2589/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mario Testino Princess Charlotte christening portrait\" width=\"1000\" height=\"764\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Testino’s portrait of the royal family and the Middletons for Princess Charlotte’s christening.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Testino’s superficial insistence on the loveliness of the royal children and their parents makes a poor contrast with a painting by Zoffany in the royal collection that depicts the sons of George III as young children surrounded, as they play, by portraits of royalty that impose duties and discipline on them. Zoffany managed to show the burdens and stresses of royal childhood in a genuinely humanising way. That was 250 years ago. Today, royal portraiture is openly deceitful. Testino famously photographed Diana, but his pictures of her tell nothing about the anguish and the sorrow of her story.</p> \n<p>Children are not jewels. They are forces of nature. Where’s the reality of childhood in these plastic fantastic visual lies executed by a master of fake truth? Why on earth do the royal family need to put out such sickening PR nonsense? It is no way to start a childhood, presented on a platter to the world by a three-star chef of sickly sweet pictorial cuisine.</p> \n<p>The Cambridges have become too valuable to royal publicity to be allowed to be real. They are turning into living lies – the impossibly perfect people with their impossibly perfect children. Please, let them be human. From the widely reviled National Portrait Gallery painting of the Duchess of Cambridge to Testino’s glitz, their image is becoming so banal in its perfections that soon the picture must crack. No one really looks like this, no life is so unblemished. Let’s have some honest royal art instead of waiting to expose the pain that was airbrushed out.

However, they feel noticeably heavier than the (already sturdy) Brooks Glycerins I’d been wearing this spring, and there is also the added leg lift you need in order not to catch the low sole on kerbs.

It worked perfectly and it was hugely freeing to not be wearing a chest strap, nor continually looking at my watch or phone to check stats. It synched with music already on my system, as well as having the option to stream shared playlists. I could simply look ahead and run, only occasionally nudged if an earbud needed slightly adjusting. If a personal trainer or running club is not available, this does a fantastic job of guiding you through varied training without leaving you weighed down by gadgetry. </p> \n<h2>FALKE IMPULSE RUNNING TIGHTS</h2> \n<p>&pound;106; <a href=\"http://www.falke.com/microsites/de/impulse-running/\">falke.com</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c831f0f995d6abdc53bdc5a8af3aef153237360f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449445500/b8003d3a-3d3d-44ae-b8bb-7a59b61e959d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\" The Falke tights claim to activate your connective tissue\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> The Falke tights claim to activate your connective tissue.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The problem here is that Falke promises the earth and charges only slightly less. These are fantastic compression tights, but claim to do significantly more. The packaging speaks effusively of “the first system that can put the positive effect of fascia (connective tissue) activation to good use in a textile”. This system is a strip of rubber nodules lining the front of the thigh and along the iliotibial band to the side, as well as the top of the hip, kneading the skin and fascia as you run. They don’t quite hurt, but certainly make you very mindful of your stride as you’re very aware of them poking you. But I’m not sure they did anything more than treat the same areas to what 20 minutes on a decent foam roller during EastEnders would have. The fabric is fantastic quality and they looked great on, but I can’t imagine recommending them to anyone. </p> \n<h2>TECHNOGYM MYRUN</h2> \n<p>&pound;2,650; <a href=\"http://www.technogym.com/gb/treadmill-myrun-not-foldable.html\">technogym.com</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b79f77f974dc0bf34f773e82c1454f35bd45666\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449499487/1fe8e580-6fde-46d5-87eb-efb1ddf2008f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Technogym Myrun\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> A treadmill that soon becomes part of the furniture.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you’re not in a position to run outdoors, this is a luxury setup. The Myrun is a discreet, relatively quiet treadmill that only looked slightly out of place in a one-bedroom flat. The app is where the treats lie: it synchs via bluetooth to an iPad that slides into a sleek slot. It tracks gait and analyses stride length and inconsistencies, allowing you to improve performance. It synchs with your heart rate monitor and your music and amends speed and elevation much faster than any gym equipment I’ve used. But I struggled with boredom over more than a couple of miles, ending up streaming TV shows rather than monitoring the beautifully designed app. And I question the point in perfecting a treadmill stride when so much of running technique relies on negotiating uneven ground or other runners. </p> \n<h2><br />ADIDAS CLIMACHILL TEE</h2> \n<p>&pound;30; <a href=\"http://www.adidas.co.uk/uncontrol-climachill-tee/AB6463.html\">adidas.co.uk</a><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"818a99ec3795ca7544f3753cae93769498c6da1a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449549711/83bf6167-8918-4b8e-8db6-745a5bf86885-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\" Aluminium dots cool you down\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> The shirt’s aluminium dots cool you down.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This looks like a nice if unexceptional running top, but works significantly better than I anticipated. Worn for a few regular runs I was convinced it was merely sweat and sea breeze making me feel cool, but I took it for a sticky session of hill repeats with my local running club and was raving about it after 45 minutes. The Climachill technology is a combination of mesh-like fabric and - crucially - about 100 small aluminium dots scattered across the top of your back and 16 more under each arm. It feels unnerving at first, but by conducting heat away from the body they create the sensation of having splashed the last few sips of your water bottle down your back, while actually keeping you dry. A remarkable effect for a great price.

A circular, sensor clicks into either an ankle or wrist strap. Worn on the ankle for running, it measures not just speed, elevation and distance, but also cadence (steps per minute), and the impact of your step on the ground - useful for avoiding injury. For beginners, it can be set to “brisk walking” but allows for sprint intervals for runners in more serious training. Instructions and feedback are provided via audio (you’ll need your own earphones), and after exercise it displayslovely clear data on your phone screen. The device can be worn on the wrist for swimming, and data is stored centrally so you can measure all your exercise across the week: perfect for the injured or resting runner.It also synched with Apple’s Health app. Impressive. </p> \n<p><em>Alexandra Heminsley is the author of </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/running-like-a-girl.html\"><em>Running Like a Girl</em></a><em> (Windmill Books)</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449243766/c069f732-e63b-4a2b-9a9c-44db14ff33db-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Karen Robinson for the Observer","altText":"Alexandra Heminsley.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436449322644/697417fd-d867-4334-9d85-4748a9c075c9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" Headphones which help you run to the beat.
