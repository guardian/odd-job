Ben Ferguson. “The first book inspired people to what to be a better version of themselves and isnpried to help other and do great things so this is kinda like of a letdown, it’s like finding that someone you looked up to is a fraud and a phony.

And Go Set A Watchman makes the point emphatically. Scout can’t go home. She isn’t even Scout any more. She’s now Jean Louise. Her childhood is long gone, so is her innocence and now she has to come to terms with the fact that her beloved father isn’t half the man she thought he was. It’s a sad story: often poignant, emotional, deeply felt. </p> \n<p>But any reader hoping to go back the glories of To Kill A Mockingbird is likely to feel some disappointment. It won’t take you to the same places. It isn’t the same. </p> \n<p>It probably isn’t as good, either. </p> \n<p>It’s way past my bed time and I’ve read in rather a hurry. I reserve the right to change my mind - and more simply to later on admit that I’m wrong. But at this stage it seems to me that To Kill A Mockingbird is a better story, better told. Here the plot is flatter and slower and the writing more ponderous. There’s none of the drama of the court case, or the mystery of Boo Radley... There’s hardly any plot at all. It isn’t helped by the long bits of internal monologue from Jean Louise. It feels didactic and laboured where the other is light as air...</p> \n<p>But hell. It’s probably unfair to complain that a book isn’t as good as To Kill A Mockingbird. What is? And while Go Set A Watchman does feel like a first draft at times, and does have a few rough edges, it’s also full of anger, complexity and moral challenges. What’s more, it contains a few fine jokes as well as some pretty weird slapstick. Much of it is appealing. I don’t regret spending time on it. I can think of far worse books to stay up the night reading. I’ll look forward to reading it again, in fact.</p> \n<p>Does it merit such scrutiny? Well, I hope so. <br /></p> \n<p>Would we all be reading it if if weren’t for To Kill A Mockingbird? Probably not.<br /></p> \n<p>But is it an interesting addition to that book and one worth reading for that reason? Most definitely. </p> \n<p>Okay... time for bed! <br /> </p>","postType":"summary"},"blocks":[{"id":"block-55a4bdd0e4b0710add77517b","title":"Did Atticus use the N-Word?","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-14T08:11:59Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-07-14T08:17:35Z","body":"<p>Interesting CNN discussion between lawyer Mark O’Mara, African American academic Marc Lamont Hill and the Conservative political commentator Ben Ferguson.</p> \n<p> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_O%27Mara\">Mark O’Mara</a>:<br /></p> \n<p>“Quite honestly I think this Atticus Finch is the original and true Atticus Finch.

And Go Set A Watchman makes the point emphatically. Scout can’t go home. She isn’t even Scout any more. She’s now Jean Louise. Her childhood is long gone, so is her innocence and now she has to come to terms with the fact that her beloved father isn’t half the man she thought he was. It’s a sad story: often poignant, emotional, deeply felt. </p> \n<p>But any reader hoping to go back the glories of To Kill A Mockingbird is likely to feel some disappointment. It won’t take you to the same places. It isn’t the same. </p> \n<p>It probably isn’t as good, either. </p> \n<p>It’s way past my bed time and I’ve read in rather a hurry. I reserve the right to change my mind - and more simply to later on admit that I’m wrong. But at this stage it seems to me that To Kill A Mockingbird is a better story, better told. Here the plot is flatter and slower and the writing more ponderous. There’s none of the drama of the court case, or the mystery of Boo Radley... There’s hardly any plot at all. It isn’t helped by the long bits of internal monologue from Jean Louise. It feels didactic and laboured where the other is light as air...</p> \n<p>But hell. It’s probably unfair to complain that a book isn’t as good as To Kill A Mockingbird. What is? And while Go Set A Watchman does feel like a first draft at times, and does have a few rough edges, it’s also full of anger, complexity and moral challenges. What’s more, it contains a few fine jokes as well as some pretty weird slapstick. Much of it is appealing. I don’t regret spending time on it. I can think of far worse books to stay up the night reading. I’ll look forward to reading it again, in fact.</p> \n<p>Does it merit such scrutiny? Well, I hope so. <br /></p> \n<p>Would we all be reading it if if weren’t for To Kill A Mockingbird? Probably not.<br /></p> \n<p>But is it an interesting addition to that book and one worth reading for that reason? Most definitely. </p> \n<p>Okay... time for bed! <br /> </p>","postType":"summary"},{"id":"block-55a48085e4b0710add77511e","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-14T03:22:58Z","body":"<p>I’m done! </p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55a48030e4b0710add77511c","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-14T03:21:45Z","body":"<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/samjordison/statuses/620794599209074688\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">On the last chapter.

And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken unto the ground.</p> \n <p>O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have heard of the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared unto you.</p> \n <p>The burden of Dumah.

Where does that leave us? It’s pleasing to note that Harper Lee has quoted the good old King James version. Although those of a proof reading persuasion among you will notice that in the relevant verse there is a comma after “Go”. There isn’t one in the book title. Apparently, an editor told Lee about this discrepancy. “That’s the Lord’s Book,” she is said to have replied. “This is my book. And there is no comma.”</p> \n<p>Did I mention that I like Harper Lee? A lot. I’m also unable to resist the temptation of pointing out how relevant this passage is on the verge of an almost-all-night reading marathon.

Indeed, she said: “Without Mockingbird there would be no Shami Chakrabarti,” she said, “and quite a few people would be happy about that...”</p> \n<p>After that Diane Abbott spent a few minutes talking about Boris’s water-cannons and making a pitch for doing his job, and I started to worry that the discussion would end up nowhere. Luckily, a member of the audience shot in with a brilliant question. “What would you have done to defend the case in To Kill A Mockingbird?” he asked Chakrabarti.</p> \n<p>She was briefly floored. The man in the audience told her a lawyer had asked him this was the question to ask, and she started joking about everyone hating lawyers until they need them and setting off on a new tangent about the uses of the profession... But her questioner wasn’t having any of it. He told her she was answering like a politician, “which is to say, not answering at all”. <br />It was pretty fascinating to see someone used to duelling with some of the meanest polticians in the land lost for words - although she salvaged the situation by resorting to frank honesty. “I’m not sure I could defend it any better,” she said in the end. “The problems of the books and the story is that he raised the most eloquent defence and still didn’t win.” She also pointed out that she is “a recovering lawyer”.<br /></p> \n<p>Abbott then made the smart point that the outcome in To Kill A Mockingbird wasn’t about the ability of the lawyer - it was the social context.

I have since then taught it and read it about that many times, and I confess that it’s my favourite novel of all time. It’s the ONLY novel I’ve read that can truly be described as “charming” and “groundbreaking” in the same sentence. Jean Louise’s descriptions of the town of Maycomb, her childhood desire to “make Boo Radley come out,” her innocent courage in front of the court house the night before the trial, and her love of her father are all elements of the novel that continue to engage the reader on every visit to the novel. It is a beautifully written story of courage. I never tire of meeting up with Scout, Jem, Dill, Cal, Boo Radley, and, of course, one of the greatest heroes in literature, Atticus Finch. I envy anyone who is opening its pages for the first time.” By <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1612736\">walkerk</a></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>&quot;It introduced me to American literature, with which I connected in a way I didn’t with British literature&quot;</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>MichaelRC</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<h2><p>Suddenly I started to become the person I wanted to be</p></h2> \n<p>I read To Kill a Mockingbird at school.

When I explained, she said, ‘You mean like me, Miss?’ But they definitely got the story. They empathised with most of the characters. We did the play that year too and it was a great hit. So much enthusiasm.” By <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1609133\">chicamisr</a></p> \n<h2>Raised in the South, I wholeheartedly related</h2> \n<p>“Raised by parents from the South, I wholeheartedly related to the humor and idioms of this book when reading it for my English class in 8th grade. It was one of the first books that I can remember that sparked my interest in literature and that helped shape my writing style. Now, as an adult and English teacher myself, I seem to better understand its themes of perseverance, empathy, and compassion. The gritty realism of the book demonstrates the prevalent cultural norms of the time, and the steadfast fortitude of Atticus and Mrs. Maudie shows the existence of those who opposed such attitudes. There is also a great balance in Atticus’s character, and it is what makes him one of the greatest American literary heroes.” By <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1609007\">Blake Downs</a></p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436786600133/17a15f8f-8fca-44bf-a69c-ac792e55caf1-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"GuardianWitness","altText":"ghosts","cleanCredit":"Photograph: GuardianWitness"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436787530202/d739e539-0350-433b-b213-258907b491cf-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Photograph: <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1608075\">PullandKick74/GuardianWitness</a>","credit":"GuardianWitness","altText":"TKAM","cleanCaption":"Photograph: <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1608075\">PullandKick74/GuardianWitness</a>"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436787145666/f57c7972-22d3-4cd8-906d-04d9e206b9ba-1020x679.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":679,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"“One copy is not enough – school copy and anniversary edition,” shared by <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55926fbfe4b01076d7bf078a/1609860\">LM Chapman</a>.

Over her breakfast coffee, she watched the last of Georgia’s hills recede and the red earth appear, and with it tin-roofed houses set in the middle of swept yards, and in the yards the inevitable verbena grew, surrounded by whitewashed tires. She grinned when she saw her first TV antenna atop an unpainted Negro house; as they multiplied, her joy rose.<br /></p> \n<p>Jean Louise Finch always made this journey by air, but she decided to go by train from New York to Maycomb Junction on her fifth annual trip home. For one thing, she had the life scared out of her the last time she was on a plane: the pilot elected to fly through a tornado. For another thing, flying home meant her father rising at three in the morning, driving a hundred miles to meet her in Mobile, and doing a full day’s work afterwards: he was seventy-two now and this was no longer fair.</p> \n<p>She was glad she had decided to go by train. Trains had changed since her childhood, and the novelty of the experience amused her: a fat genie of a porter materialized when she pressed a button on a wall; at her bidding a stainless steel washbasin popped out of another wall, and there was a john one could prop one’s feet on. She resolved not to be intimidated by several messages stenciled around her compartment – a roomette, they called it – but when she went to bed the night before, she succeeded in folding herself up into the wall because she had ignored an injunction to PULL THIS LEVER DOWN OVER BRACKETS, a situation remedied by the porter to her embarrassment, as her habit was to sleep only in pajama tops.</p> \n<p>Luckily, he happened to be patrolling the corridor when the trap snapped shut with her in it: “I’ll get you out, Miss,” he called in answer to her poundings from within. “No please,” she said. “Just tell me how to get out.” “I can do it with my back turned,” he said, and did.</p> \n<p>When she awoke that morning the train was switching and chugging in the Atlanta yards, but in obedience to another sign in her compartment she stayed in bed until College Park flashed by. When she dressed, she put on her Maycomb clothes: gray slacks, a black sleeveless blouse, white socks, and loafers. Although it was four hours away, she could hear her aunt’s sniff of disapproval.</p> \n<p>When she was starting on her fourth cup of coffee the Crescent Limited honked like a giant goose at its northbound mate and rumbled across the Chattahoochee into Alabama.</p> \n<p>The Chattahoochee is wide, flat, and muddy. It was low today; a yellow sandbar had reduced its flow to a trickle. Perhaps it sings in the wintertime, she thought: I do not remember a line of that poem. Piping down the valleys wild? No. Did he write to a waterfowl, or was it a waterfall?</p> \n<p>She sternly repressed a tendency to boisterousness when she reflected that Sidney Lanier must have been somewhat like her long-departed cousin, Joshua Singleton St Clair, whose private literary preserves stretched from the Black Belt to Bayou La Batre. Jean Louise’s aunt often held up Cousin Joshua to her as a family example not lightly to be discountenanced: he was a splendid figure of a man, he was a poet, he was cut off in his prime, and Jean Louise would do well to remember that he was a credit to the family. His pictures did the family well – Cousin Joshua looked like a ratty Algernon Swinburne.</p> \n<p>Jean Louise smiled to herself when she remembered her father telling her the rest of it. Cousin Joshua was cut off, all right, not by the hand of God but by Caesar’s hosts. </p> \n<p>When at the University, Cousin Joshua studied too hard and thought too much; in fact, he read himself straight out of the nineteenth century. He affected an Inverness cape and wore jackboots he had a blacksmith make up from his own design. Cousin Joshua was frustrated by the authorities when he fired upon the president of the University, who in his opinion was little more than a sewage disposal expert. This was no doubt true, but an idle excuse for assault with a deadly weapon. After much passing around of money Cousin Joshua was moved across the tracks and placed in state accommodations for the irresponsible, where he remained for the rest of his days. They said he was reasonable in every respect until someone mentioned that president’s name, then his face would become distorted, he would assume a whooping crane attitude and hold it for eight hours or more, and nothing or nobody could make him lower his leg until he forgot about that man. On clear days Cousin Joshua read Greek, and he left a thin volume of verse printed privately by a firm in Tuscaloosa. The poetry was so ahead of its time no one has deciphered it yet, but Jean Louise’s aunt keeps it displayed casually and prominently on a table in the living-room.</p> \n<p>Jean Louise laughed aloud, then looked around to see if anyone had heard her. Her father had a way of undermining his sister’s lectures on the innate superiority of any given Finch: he always told his daughter the rest of it, quietly and solemnly, but Jean Louise sometimes thought she detected an unmistakably profane glint in Atticus Finch’s eyes, or was it merely the light hitting his glasses? She never knew.</p> \n<p>The countryside and the train had subsided to a gentle roll, and she could see nothing but pastureland and black cows from window to horizon. She wondered why she had never thought her country beautiful.</p> \n<p>The station at Montgomery nestled in an elbow of the Alabama, and when she got off the train to stretch her legs, the returning familiar with its drabness, lights, and curious odors rose to meet her. There is something missing, she thought. Hotboxes, that’s it. A man goes along under the train with a crowbar. There is a clank and then <em>s-sss-sss</em>, white smoke comes up and you think you’re inside a chafing dish. These things run on oil now.</p> \n<p>For no reason an ancient fear gnawed her. She had not been in this station for twenty years, but when she was a child and went to the capital with Atticus, she was terrified lest the swaying train plunge down the riverbank and drown them all. But when she boarded again for home, she forgot.</p> \n<p>The train clacketed through pine forests and honked derisively at a gaily painted bell-funneled museum piece sidetracked in a clearing. It bore the sign of a lumber concern, and the Crescent Limited could have swallowed it whole with room to spare. Greenville, Evergreen, Maycomb Junction.</p> \n<p>She had told the conductor not to forget to let her off, and because the conductor was an elderly man, she anticipated his joke: he would rush at Maycomb Junction like a bat out of hell and stop the train a quarter of a mile past the little station, then when he bade her goodbye he would say he was sorry, he almost forgot. Trains changed; conductors never did. Being funny at flag stops with young ladies was a mark of the profession, and Atticus, who could predict the actions of every conductor from New Orleans to Cincinnati, would be waiting accordingly not six steps away from her point of debarkation.</p> \n<p>Home was Maycomb County, a gerrymander some seventy miles long and spreading thirty miles at its widest point, a wilderness dotted with tiny settlements the largest of which was Maycomb, the county seat. Until comparatively recently in its history, Maycomb County was so cut off from the rest of the nation that some of its citizens, unaware of the South’s political predilections over the past ninety years, still voted Republican. No trains went there – Maycomb Junction, a courtesy title, was located in Abbott County, twenty miles away. Bus service was erratic and seemed to go nowhere, but the Federal Government had forced a highway or two through the swamps, thus giving the citizens an opportunity for free egress. But few people took advantage of the roads, and why should they? If you did not want much, there was plenty.</p> \n<p>The county and the town were named for a Colonel Mason Maycomb, a man whose misplaced self-confidence and overweening willfulness brought confusion and confoundment to all who rode with him in the Creek Indian Wars. The territory in which he operated was vaguely hilly in the north and flat in the south, on the fringes of the coastal plain. Colonel Maycomb, convinced that Indians hated to fight on flat land, scoured the northern reaches of the territory looking for them. When his general discovered that Maycomb was meandering in the hills while the Creeks were lurking in every pine thicket in the south, he dispatched a friendly Indian runner to Maycomb with the message, <em>Move south, damn you</em>. Maycomb was convinced this was a Creek plot to trap him (was there not a blue-eyed, red-headed devil leading them?), he made the friendly Indian runner his prisoner, and he moved farther north until his forces became hopelessly lost in the forest primeval, where they sat out the wars in considerable bewilderment.<br /></p> \n<p>After enough years had passed to convince Colonel Maycomb that the message might have been genuine after all, he began a purposeful march to the south, and on the way his troops encountered settlers moving inland, who told them the Indian Wars were about over. The troops and the settlers were friendly enough to become Jean Louise Finch’s ancestors, and Colonel Maycomb pressed on to what is now Mobile to make sure his exploits were given due credit. Recorded history’s version does not coincide with the truth, but these are the facts, because they were passed down by word of mouth through the years, and every Maycombian knows them.<br /></p> \n<p>“…get your bags, Miss,” the porter said. Jean Louise followed him from the lounge car to her compartment. She took two dollars from her billfold: one for routine, one for releasing her last night. The train, of course, rushed like a bat out of hell past the station and came to a stop 440 yards beyond it. The conductor appeared, grinning, and said he was sorry, he almost forgot. Jean Louise grinned back and waited impatiently for the porter to put the yellow step in place. He handed her down and she gave him the two bills.</p> \n<p>Her father was not waiting for her.<br /></p> \n<p>She looked up the track toward the station and saw a tall man standing on the tiny platform. He jumped down and ran to meet her.<br /></p> \n<p>He grabbed her in a bear hug, put her from him, kissed her hard on the mouth, then kissed her gently. “Not here, Hank,” she murmured, much pleased.<br /></p> \n<p>“Hush, girl,” he said, holding her face in place. “I’ll kiss you on the courthouse steps if I want to.”<br /></p> \n<p>The possessor of the right to kiss her on the courthouse steps was Henry Clinton, her lifelong friend, her brother’s comrade, and if he kept on kissing her like that, her husband. Love whom you will but marry your own kind was a dictum amounting to instinct within her. Henry Clinton was Jean Louise’s own kind, and now she did not consider the dictum particularly harsh.<br /></p> \n<p>They walked arm-in-arm down the track to collect her suitcase. “How’s Atticus?” she said.<br /></p> \n<p>“His hands and shoulders are giving him fits today.” <br /></p> \n<p>“He can’t drive when they’re like that, can he?”<br /></p> \n<p>Henry closed the fingers of his right hand halfway and said, “He can’t close them any more than this. Miss Alexandra has to tie his shoes and button his shirts when they’re like that. He can’t even hold a razor.”<br /></p> \n<p>Jean Louise shook her head. She was too old to rail against the inequity of it, but too young to accept her father’s crippling disease without putting up some kind of fight. “Isn’t there anything they can do?”<br /></p> \n<p>“You know there isn’t,” Henry said. “He takes seventy grains of aspirin a day and that’s all.”<br /></p> \n<p>Henry picked up her heavy suitcase, and they walked back toward the car. She wondered how she would behave when her time came to hurt day in and day out. Hardly like Atticus: if you asked him how he was feeling he would tell you, but he never complained; his disposition remained the same, so in order to find out how he was feeling, you had to ask him.<br /></p> \n<p>The only way Henry found out about it was by accident. One day when they were in the records vault at the courthouse running a land title, Atticus hauled out a heavy mortgage book, turned stark white, and dropped it. “What’s the matter?” Henry had said. “Rheumatoid arthritis. Can you pick it up for me?” said Atticus. Henry asked him how long he’d had it; Atticus said six months. Did Jean Louise know it? No. Then he’d better tell her. “If you tell her she’ll be down here trying to nurse me. The only remedy for this is not to let it beat you.” The subject was closed.<br /></p> \n<p>“Want to drive?” said Henry.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6744c2c87508e0cb6c761891de487fd09df538d1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436513668340/7d82d4b8-de7a-4e2a-88c0-ab6935395ede-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Go Set A Watchman\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>“Don’t be silly,” she said. Although she was a respectable driver, she hated to operate anything mechanical more complicated than a safety pin: folding lawn chairs were a source of profound irritation to her; she had never learned to ride a bicycle or use a typewriter; she fished with a pole. Her favorite game was golf because its essential principles consisted of a stick, a small ball, and a state of mind.<br /></p> \n<p>With green envy, she watched Henry’s effortless mastery of the automobile. Cars are his servants, she thought. “Power steering? Automatic transmission?” she said.<br /></p> \n<p>“You bet,” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>“Well, what if everything shuts off and you don’t have any gears to shift. You’d be in trouble then, wouldn’t you?”<br /></p> \n<p>“But everything won’t shut off.”<br /></p> \n<p>“How do you know?”<br /></p> \n<p>“That’s what faith is. Come here.”<br /></p> \n<p>Faith in General Motors. She put her head on his shoulder. “Hank,” she said presently. “What really happened?” <br /></p> \n<p>This was an old joke between them. A pink scar started under his right eye, hit the corner of his nose, and ran diagonally across his upper lip. Behind his lip were six false front teeth not even Jean Louise could induce him to take out and show her. He came home from the war with them. A German, more to express his displeasure at the end of the war than anything else, had bashed him in the face with a rifle butt. Jean Louise had chosen to think this a likely story: what with guns that shot over the horizon, B-17s, V-bombs, and the like, Henry had probably not been within spitting distance of the Germans.<br /></p> \n<p>“Okay, honey,” he said. “We were down in a cellar in Berlin. Everybody had too much to drink and a fight started – you like to hear the believable, don’t you? Now will you marry me?”<br /></p> \n<p>“Not yet.”<br /></p> \n<p>“Why?”<br /></p> \n<p>“I want to be like Dr Schweitzer and play until I’m thirty.”<br /></p> \n<p>“He played all right,” said Henry grimly.<br /></p> \n<p>Jean Louise moved under his arm. “You know what I mean,” she said. <br /></p> \n<p>“Yes.”<br /></p> \n<p>There was no finer young man, said the people of Maycomb, than Henry Clinton. Jean Louise agreed. Henry was from the southern end of the county. His father had left his mother soon after Henry was born, and she worked night and day in her little crossroads store to send Henry through the Maycomb public schools. Henry, from the time he was twelve, boarded across the street from the Finch house, and this in itself put him on a higher plane: he was his own master, free from the authority of cooks, yardmen, and parents. He was also four years her senior, which made a difference then. He teased her; she adored him. When he was fourteen his mother died, leaving him next to nothing. Atticus Finch looked after what little money there was from the sale of the store – her funeral expenses took most of it – he secretly supplemented it with money of his own, and got Henry a job clerking in the Jitney Jungle after school. Henry graduated and went into the Army, and after the war he went to the University and studied law.<br /></p> \n<p>Just about that time, Jean Louise’s brother dropped dead in his tracks one day, and after the nightmare of that was over, Atticus, who had always thought of leaving his practice to his son, looked around for another young man. It was natural for him to engage Henry, and in due course Henry became Atticus’s legman, his eyes, and his hands. Henry had always respected Atticus Finch; soon it melded to affection and Henry regarded him as a father.<br /></p> \n<p>He did not regard Jean Louise as a sister. In the years when he was away at the war and the University, she had turned from an overalled, fractious, gun-slinging creature into a reasonable facsimile of a human being. He began dating her on her annual two-week visits home, and although she still moved like a thirteen-year-old boy and abjured most feminine adornment, he found something so intensely feminine about her that he fell in love. She was easy to look at and easy to be with most of the time, but she was in no sense of the word an easy person. She was afflicted with a restlessness of spirit he could not guess at, but he knew she was the one for him. He would protect her; he would marry her.<br /></p> \n<p>“Tired of New York?” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>“No.”<br /></p> \n<p>“Give me a free hand for these two weeks and I’ll make you tired of it.”<br /></p> \n<p>“Is that an improper suggestion?”<br /></p> \n<p>“Yes.”<br /></p> \n<p>“Go to hell, then.”<br /></p> \n<p>Henry stopped the car. He turned off the ignition switch, slewed around, and looked at her. She knew when he became serious about something: his crew cut bristled like an angry brush, his face colored, its scar reddened.<br /></p> \n<p>“Honey, do you want me to put it like a gentleman? Miss Jean Louise, I have now reached an economic status that can provide for the support of two. I, like Israel of Old, have labored seven years in the vineyards of the University and the pastures of your daddy’s office for you –”<br /></p> \n<p>“I’ll tell Atticus to make it seven more.”<br /></p> \n<p>“Hateful.”<br /></p> \n<p>“Besides,” she said, “it was Jacob anyway. No, they were the same. They always changed their names every third verse. How’s Aunty?”<br /></p> \n<p>“You know good and well she’s been fine for thirty years. Don’t change the subject.”<br /></p> \n<p>Jean Louise’s eyebrows flickered. “Henry,” she said primly, “I’ll have an affair with you but I won’t marry you.”<br /></p> \n<p>It was exactly right.<br /></p> \n<p>“Don’t be such a damn child, Jean Louise!” Henry sputtered, and forgetting the latest dispensations from General Motors, grabbed for a gearshift and stomped at a clutch. These denied him, he wrenched the ignition key violently, pressed some buttons, and the big car glided slowly and smoothly down the highway.<br /></p> \n<p>“Slow pickup, isn’t it?” she said. “No good for city driving.” Henry glared at her. “What do you mean by that?”<br /></p> \n<p>In another minute this would become a quarrel. He was serious. She’d better make him furious, thus silent, so she could think about it.<br /></p> \n<p>“Where’d you get that appalling tie?” she said. <br /></p> \n<p>Now.<br /></p> \n<p>She was almost in love with him. No, that’s impossible, she thought: either you are or you aren’t. Love’s the only thing in this world that is unequivocal. There are different kinds of love, certainly, but it’s a you-do or you-don’t proposition with them all.<br /></p> \n<p>She was a person who, when confronted with an easy way out, always took the hard way. The easy way out of this would be to marry Hank and let him labor for her. After a few years, when the children were waist-high, the man would come along whom she should have married in the first place. There would be searchings of hearts, fevers and frets, long looks at each other on the post office steps, and misery for everybody. The hollering and the high-mindedness over, all that would be left would be another shabby little affair &agrave; la the Birmingham country club set, and a self-constructed private Gehenna with the latest Westinghouse appliances. Hank didn’t deserve that.<br /></p> \n<p>No. For the present she would pursue the stony path of spinsterhood. She set about restoring peace with honor:<br /></p> \n<p>“Honey, I’m sorry, truly sorry,” she said, and she was.<br /></p> \n<p>“That’s okay,” said Henry, and slapped her knee. “It’s just that I could kill you sometimes.”<br /></p> \n<p>“I know I’m hateful.”<br /></p> \n<p>Henry looked at her. “You’re an odd one, sweet. You can’t dissemble.”<br /></p> \n<p>She looked at him. “What are you talking about?”<br /></p> \n<p>“Well, as a general rule, most women, before they’ve got ’em, present to their men smiling, agreeing faces. They hide their thoughts. You now, when you’re feeling hateful, honey, you <em>are</em> hateful.”<br /></p> \n<p>“Isn’t it fairer for a man to be able to see what he’s letting himself in for?”<br /></p> \n<p>“Yes, but don’t you see you’ll never catch a man that way?”<br /></p> \n<p>She bit her tongue on the obvious, and said, “How do I go about being an enchantress?”<br /></p> \n<p>Henry warmed to his subject. At thirty, he was an adviser. Maybe because he was a lawyer. “First,” he said dispassionately, “hold your tongue. Don’t argue with a man, especially when you know you can beat him. Smile a lot. Make him feel big. Tell him how wonderful he is, and wait on him.”<br /></p> \n<p>She smiled brilliantly and said, “Hank, I agree with everything you’ve said. You are the most perspicacious individual I’ve met in years, you are six feet five, and may I light your cigarette? How’s that?”<br /></p> \n<p>“Awful.”<br /></p> \n<p>They were friends again. <br /></p> \n<ul> \n <li>This is an extract from Go Set A Watchman by Harper Lee, published on 14 July by William Heinemann at &pound;18.99.

This apparently simple question has been contested in the months before Tuesday’s much publicised and heavily embargoed release of a manuscript that reportedly came to light only recently.<br /></p> \n<p> Chronologically, Go Set a Watchman is, in Hollywood arithmetic, a sort of Mockingbird 2, depicting the later lives of the Finch family – lawyer Atticus, his daughter, Scout, his son, Jem and their maid, Calpurnia – who appeared in Lee’s 1960 debut book about a racially inflamed rape trial in Alabama. However, in computing terms, Watchman is Mockingbird 1.0 to the Mockingbird 2.0 of the novel that was previously the 89-year-old Lee’s single published work. Some sceptical advance publicity had suggested that the new book was merely an earlier draft of the first one, representing the text before editors and publishers demanded a substantial revision.</p> \n<p> As it turns out, however, Go Set a Watchman is of a very different order from “revised” or “alternative” editions of, for example, The Great Gatsby or Ulysses, which sought to restore or record the supposedly original intentions of F Scott Fitzgerald and James Joyce.</p> \n<p> Whereas To Kill a Mockingbird is narrated in the first-person by Scout as a young girl looking back a few years to events in the early 1930s, Go Set a Watchman is a third-person narrative, in which twentysomething Scout, now favouring her baptismal name of Jean Louise, returns from New York to visit Atticus, 72 and seriously arthritic, in her home town of Maycomb. Apart from their four-word poetic titles (the new novel’s is taken from the biblical book of Isaiah), the texts are largely independent of each other. Mockingbird is structured in 30 chapters divided between two sections; Watchman consists of seven parts including 19 chapters. </p> \n<p> A few passages exactly overlap between the two books, principally scene-setters describing Maycomb, Alabamian history and local folklore such as the comical legal consequences of the intermarriage of the Cunningham and Coningham clans. A handful of paragraphs alluding to the Robinson rape case in the 1930s (though with one crucial detail changed) were expanded to hundreds of pages in To Kill a Mockingbird. Encountering these seed sentences, it is hard not to feel some awe at the literary midwives who spotted, in the original conception, the greater literary sibling that existed in embryo. If the text now published had been the one released in 1960, it would almost certainly not have achieved the same greatness.</p> \n<p> This is not so much due to literary inferiority, but because Go Set a Watchman is a much less likable and school-teachable book. It belongs to the genre in which prodigals return to find their homeland painfully altered; disillusioned by the “Atomic Age”, Scout has notably lost the sassy swagger that makes her childish I-voice in Mockingbird so compelling.</p> \n<p> Advance publicity has billed the second Lee as a chance to reunite with the “much loved” characters of Scout and Atticus. This promise proves barely half true. When the homecomer frets that no one in Maycomb remembers the “juvenile desperado, hellraiser extraordinary” that she was, it is tempting to yell back that we have never forgotten her, although wincing when she approvingly notes the smell of “clean Negro”, with all that term implies. (Unlike its predecessor, this text seems to have been printed much as submitted.)</p> \n<p> With regard to Scout’s father, though, some lovers of the classic version may feel moved to ask if they can now file an emergency rewrite of their school or university essays. While one of the book’s two great shocks – the failure of a major figure to survive into the 1950s – is emotionally jolting, the other shatters the traditional reading of Atticus as a saintly widowed single father whose views on race were decades ahead of his countrymen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jul/11/harper-lee-my-little-sister-alice-finch-lee\">Harper Lee: my little sister</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> This liberal hero, who was ostracised as a “nigger lover” in Mockingbird – both books present uncensored the racist hate speech of their eras – is found behaving, in the 1950s, in a way that admirers of print and film (played by Gregory Peck) versions of his earlier life will find painful and shocking. To the horror also of his daughter, the anti-racist lawyer now attends public meetings to oppose the supreme court’s attempts to impose integrated education and equal voting rights in the south. For many readers, large stretches of Watchman will be like discovering an alternative version of The Catcher in the Rye in which JD Salinger casts the story of the adolescent Holden Caulfield as the dream of a paedophile Republican senator.</p> \n<p> The shift in Atticus’s attitudes proves to be nuanced and rooted in the deep political complexities of the south – which New York editors may reasonably have thought too obscure for a broader audience – but their excision significantly altered the story. While there can be no doubt that the editorial attention given to Mockingbird made the narrative more gripping – the new publication has no equivalent climax to the courtroom drama of the Robinson trial – it can also be accused of having liberally (in two senses) sanitised the contents.</p> \n<p> If the racial politics of Watchman may prove unsettling to contemporary book buyers, time has been kinder to another ideological strain. Scout was appealingly established as a proto-feminist by the moment in Mockingbird when she is schooled in the manners of a lady and replies that she is “not particularly” interested in becoming one; the new book movingly expands on her continuing adult refusal to submit to conventional domestic expectations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/ng-interactive/2015/jul/10/go-set-a-watchman-read-the-first-chapter\">Go Set A Watchman: read the first chapter - interactive</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> The to-and-fro ahead of the original publication also seems to have steered the writer away from stretches of modernist linguistic playfulness, such as a powerful parody of Lincoln’s Gettysburg address, and a tremendous scene in which a party thrown to welcome Scout home – known as “a coffee” – is represented by a fugue of fragments of banal local chatter.</p> \n<p> </p> \n<p> Regardless of whether the new book is regarded as Mockingbird 2 or Mockingbird 1.0, it is, in most respects, a new work, and a pleasure, revelation and genuine literary event, akin to the discovery of extra sections from T S Eliot’s The Waste Land or a missing act from Hamlet hinting that the prince may have killed his father.</p> \n<p> Teachers of American literature have been handed a fascinating potential course comparing and contrasting the pair, while there is clearly opportunity for a new movie of To Kill a Mockingbird combining the two genres most beloved by modern Hollywood – remake and sequel – within a structure of interlocking flashbacks that are the most fashionable form of movie narrative.</p> \n<p> Until then, Go Set a Watchman shakes the settled view of both an author and her novel. And, unless another surprise for readers lies somewhere in her files, this publication intensifies the regret that Harper Lee published so little.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Go Set a Watchman is published by William Heinemann on 14 July at &pound;18.99.

A strike from a dust particle the size of a grain of rice could destroy the spacecraft, but the risk of such a disaster is low, at around one in 10,000.<br /></p> \n<p>The New Horizons spacecraft has spent more than nine years on its 4.8bn kilometre journey to Pluto, the last world in the solar system to be visited by a spacecraft.

Seven months later, astronomers at the International Astronomical Union voted to downgrade the icy body to a dwarf planet, because it does not dominate its region of space in the way the other major planets do.<br /></p> \n<p>The spacecraft will take scores of photographs as it speeds past Pluto and its five known moons, Charon, Hydra, Nix, STyx and Kerberos. The images will give the first close-up view of the mountains and valleys of the unknown world, and its tenuous atmosphere seen as the sun rises and sets behind it. Instruments on New Horizons might even find evidence that it snows on the tiny world.<br /></p> \n<p>Nasa officials expect the first images from the flyby to be released on Wednesday night. The snapshots from onboard cameras will capture details up to 100 metres across, a vast improvement on those taken on approach, which pick out features about 15 kilometres across. </p> \n<p>But scientists are in for a long wait to learn everything New Horizons sees. The probe will collect so much information as it passes Pluto that it will take 16 months to send it all back to Earth.<br /></p> \n<p>The mission marks the end of the US space agency’s bid to explore every planet in the solar system, starting with Venus in 1962.

payment system hits UK stores as an alternative to credit card – but is it worth signing up?","standFirst":"<p>Apple’s new contactless iPhone payment system hits UK stores as an alternative to credit card – but is it worth signing up?</p>","byline":"Samuel Gibbs","body":"<p>A new contactless payment system that lets people use their iPhones to tap-and-pay in high street shops has been launched in the UK. Apple Pay will let iPhone 6, 6 Plus and Apple Watch owners pay for items costing up to &pound;20 by just touching their gadgets to a payment terminal, much like contactless credit cards.</p> \n<p>The UK launch marks the first expansion of Apple’s contactless payment system beyond the US, where it rolled out <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/08/us-retailers-slow-apple-pay\">last October</a>. Contactless payments have become increasingly popular in the UK with major banks offering cards that can just be tapped to pay, eliminating the need to type in a pin.</p> \n<p>Apple will hope its system proves popular by reducing the number of items people need to carry, and by offering the extra security of using fingerprint recognition.</p> \n<h2>How does it work?</h2> \n<p>Apple Pay is effectively a digital wallet. It lets users use their credit and debit cards through Apple’s Passbook app. There are two ways to use it: in a physical high street store and online.</p> \n<p>Only people with the latest generation of iPhones, or an Apple Watch, will be able to use it in stores. Apple Pay uses near-field communications (NFC) found in the iPhone 6, 6 Plus or Apple Watch in a similar manner to contactless cards.<br /></p> \n<p>Unlike contactless cards, Apple Pay includes an extra security measure known as tokenisation, which ensures that the card details stored on a phone are never passed to the retailer. Instead, the payee receives a one-use “token” allowing them to debit the payment only once.</p> \n<p>The payments are secured and verified by the owner’s fingerprint using Apple’s Touch ID system. This might make it slower sometimes when authentication is required compared to using a contactless card but the security-conscious may appreciate the extra check. </p> \n<h2>Which cards can I use?</h2> \n<p>The first wave of banks to support the payment system in the UK include NatWest, Nationwide Building Society, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander and Ulster Bank and MBNA. First Direct and HSBC will join later in July while Apple promises a second wave in the autumn, including Bank of Scotland, Halifax, Lloyds Bank, M&amp;S Bank and TSB Bank.</p> \n<p>A notable absentee is Barclays, which is apparently still working some things out, likely around Apple’s cut of each transaction.</p> \n<h2>Where can I use it?</h2> \n<p>A variety of banks, credit card companies and retailers have lined up to support Apple Pay. Most retailers that already accept contactless payments via credit and debit cards will support the new pay system.</p> \n<p>Notable companies and services include Waitrose, Co-op, Lidl, Spar, Boots, Marks and Spencer, Post Office, BP, Costa Coffee, Starbucks, LePain Quotidien, Wagamama, Nandos, KFC, Pret A Manger, Subway, McDonald’s, the Trainline, Transport for London and Liberty.</p> \n<p>For online payments the list includes Addison Lee, Argos, British Airways, Domino’s, easyJet, Hailo, hungryhouse, Just Eat, lastminute.com, Miss Selfridge, Ocado, Topshop and Zara.<br /></p> \n<p>When used to pay online, Apple Pay will operate similar to the way PayPal works on Samsung smartphones, using a fingerprint to authenticate payments without having to enter credit card details on supporting sites.</p> \n<h2>Is there a limit?<br /></h2> \n<p>Most payments will be limited to the &pound;20 cap that is currently in force for contactless payments using credit or debit cards. That limit will rise to &pound;30 in September.</p> \n<p>But Apple Pay will be able to support larger payment amounts using updated terminals in shops that verify the user’s payment credentials using Touch ID instead of having to enter a pin.</p> \n<p>How quickly support for larger payments rolls out has yet to be confirmed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/02/apple-pay-mobile-payment-system-scammers\">Apple Pay: a new frontier for scammers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>What’s the competition doing?</h2> \n<p>Unlike the US, the UK has had robust support for contactless payments through credit and debit cards. Contactless payments were up 255% in 2014, while 58m contactless cards were in circulation.</p> \n<p>Companies such as PayPal, services operated through mobile phone operators such as EE’s Cash on Tap and smartphone manufacturers such as Samsung and Google also have their own payment solutions, but have struggled to gain traction.</p> \n<p>The launch of Apple Pay is likely to improve support and awareness of smartphone payments, but whether users will be convinced to pull out their smartphone instead of their credit card remains to be seen.</p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/08/us-retailers-slow-apple-pay\">US slow to take bite of Apple Pay</a></strong></p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436794693243/ab50475d-48f5-4961-9b5f-ed6b92895b80-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Justin Sullivan/Getty Images","altText":"Apple Pay","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T06:33:23Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T07:49:11Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":41,"contributors":[{"name":"Samuel Gibbs","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/samuel-gibbs"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Apple","iPhone","Apple Watch","iPhone 6","Technology","Smartphones","Mobile phones","Contactless payments","Money","Consumer affairs","Banks and building societies"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/apple","webTitle":"Apple"},{"id":"technology/iphone","webTitle":"iPhone"},{"id":"technology/apple-watch","webTitle":"Apple Watch"},{"id":"technology/iphone-6","webTitle":"iPhone 6"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"technology/smartphones","webTitle":"Smartphones"},{"id":"technology/mobilephones","webTitle":"Mobile phones"},{"id":"money/contactless-payments","webTitle":"Contactless payments"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"money/consumer-affairs","webTitle":"Consumer affairs"},{"id":"money/banks","webTitle":"Banks and building societies"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Samuel Gibbs","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/samuel-gibbs"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jul/14/apple-pay-launches-uk-how-to-use","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ajxv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/jul/14/apple-pay-launches-uk-how-to-use","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/14/apple-pay-launches-uk-how-to-use"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436794693243/ab50475d-48f5-4961-9b5f-ed6b92895b80-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Apple’s smartphone payments finally come to the UK after launching in the US in October 2014.

The 89-year-old walks with a stick, but insists she needs no help to climb the steep, bannister-less flight of stairs to my flat. White-haired and smartly dressed in a purple cardigan and black trousers, she has agreed to come round for a cup of tea and an eclair, but is scathing about the health secretary’s suggestions that people should live with their elderly relatives to combat loneliness. “They might be all right with me, but I wouldn’t be all right with them,” she says firmly. “I want to be independent and I don’t think it’s fair on them.”</p> \n<p>Since the death of her husband, Cyril, Frances has lived alone in the flat they shared in north London. The couple were married for 60 years and were very close, taking weekly trips to concerts at the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/extra/southbank-centre\">Southbank Centre</a> and going to the theatre. “We were very happy together, and that’s why we didn’t bother with anyone else,” she says. Frances worked in Boots and then the Post Office, so had many acquaintances but allowed old friendships to slip away and when, at the end of his life, her husband was diagnosed with <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/society/alzheimers\">Alzheimer’s</a>, she spent her days caring for him.</p> \n<p>Since his death, more than a year ago, Frances says the days have seemed so long and lonely she finds even getting out of bed a struggle. “We still have his ashes at home and some days I say to him, ‘It’s all your fault!’” she tells me, smiling. She has three sons – one of whom spends a couple of nights a week with her, and another who comes every Saturday to take her shopping – as well as six grandchildren: “I don’t let them know I am lonely because they would be unhappy.” She says it is having someone to do nothing with that she misses, but thinks living with relatives would be too stressful. “We don’t have the same views so why upset myself or have a row with them?”</p> \n<p>What does help is having a cup of tea and a chat. I met Frances through the charity <a href=\"http://www.contact-the-elderly.org.uk/\">Contact the Elderly</a>, which hosts a tea party at the home of a volunteer every month.With so few people knowing their neighbours, and families spread across the country, it is a chance for different generations to mix, as well as for older people to feel less isolated. “I look forward to it and I’m sure everyone else does too,” Frances says. It’s a simple idea, but after an hour of talking to Frances it’s not hard to see the attraction. She is engaging company and, despite the initial scrabble to make my flat fit to be seen, meeting her has already brightened my day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"092417eb82f8f5092fc17cbcf71be294d89ba3c8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436811357033/2d933aa0-0fc4-4478-bf6a-a8e03dfdaa92-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"‘It’s clear Jimmy doesn’t need help from Hunt or from me’ … Jimmy Sheehan visits Sam Wollaston.

Jimmy is 74 and lives a few doors down from me in Dollis Hill, north-west London. I know Jimmy for a chat on the pavement – tennis, local gossip, so-and-so at number so-and-so. And actually we have a connection (his half-brother works with my brother), but he’s never been into my house. Until now.</p> \n<p>Born in the city of Cork in the south-west of Ireland, Jimmy was adopted at five and worked on farms until coming to London in 1961, in search of factory work. He met his wife-to-be at Smiths clock factory in Cricklewood. They had a boy and a girl, then got unmarried. His last job was at an electrical factory – they made switches – on the North Circular, before retiring 10 years ago. Jimmy met his real mum, and the kids she had later (Jimmy’s half-brothers and -sisters) when he was 62.</p> \n<p>It’s very clear that Jimmy doesn’t need any help, from Hunt or from me. He is neither isolated nor alone. His daughter, now in her 40s, lives with him, and his son who has kids of his own isn’t far away. Plus he seems to know everyone in the neighbourhood. “Well, they say I’ve got a good personality,” he says. “I don’t know if it’s true or not. I seem to be friendly with everyone on the road.”</p> \n<p>I’d say it was true. He’s very sociable, polite and chivalrous too: he apologises to Sarah the photographer when he calls someone – not her – “a right cow”. Even if he isn’t lonely, I’m very pleased to have had Jimmy over, because he’s excellent company, and I wish I’d asked him in before.</p> \n<p>He can see that Hunt’s idea could be good for some people. “It depends, if they wanted it,” he says. In fact he’s been signed up to such a scheme for years, but as a helper rather than a helpee. Until she recently went into hospital, he’d been doing the shopping for his own neighbour who is 10 years older than he is. “Not all of it, the heavy stuff, the potatoes.”</p> \n<p>See? As Jimmy says, he’s not old.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3a2b234148152cf8d0916efe54c9282aa38d7d4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436804855002/356b7091-5567-4553-998f-ecfcda65bad4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Helen Pidd and Enid take tea and lemon drizzle cake.

You have to be careful’</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Helen Pidd meets Enid, Manchester </strong></p> \n<p>I first met Enid a year and a half ago. I’d just got back from the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/nov/11/crowds-mourn-percival-war-veteran\">funeral of Harold “Coe” Percival, </a>an RAF veteran from Lytham St Annes, near Blackpool, who had died with no friends or family. Hundreds of strangers ended up attending his cremation after the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/nov/09/military-veterans-respond-funeral-appeal-war-hero\">undertakers put out an advert</a> appealing for service personnel to attend, fearing the 99-year-old would be laid to rest alone.</p> \n<p>It was the jolt I needed to offer my services to <a href=\"http://chorltongoodneighbours.org/\">Chorlton Good Neighbours</a>, an intergenerational care group in south Manchester that connects young, able-bodied people with older members of the community. After undergoing a criminal records check and an interview in which I was asked, among other things, if I would be more comfortable with someone who could chat for England versus one who rarely opened their mouth (I chose the former), I was hooked up with Enid, a widowed primary school teacher with a keen interest in current affairs and an even keener interest in my love life.</p> \n<p>Usually <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/dec/13/lexus-nx-300h-f-sport-car-review\">I take Enid shopping to Stretford Mall</a>, but when she had her hip replaced earlier this year I visited her in hospital and at home. Now 85, she had never been to my house, but when I phoned her to see if she fancies taking part in Jeremy Hunt’s experiment she declares herself game.</p> \n<p>Over Earl Grey and lemon drizzle cake baked in her honour, we discuss Hunt’s proposal. She is largely supportive, but warns that many of her contemporaries don’t want visitors and may feel patronised by the offer. “I’d get to know them a little bit before inviting them round,” she counsels. “Ask if they need you to pick up a prescription or a bit of shopping. Then lead up to it. That way the old person gets to know you first.”</p> \n<p>Despite her fascination with crime – she once made me drive by the scene of a stabbing on the way to Tesco’s – she worries that ne’er-do-wells may take advantage of Hunt’s advice. “You can’t trust everybody,” she says. “People are wary. I’m not saying the world is full of baddies, but there are quite a few about. You read about it in the paper, old people being tricked out of their pension or being asked for their pin numbers. You have to be careful, you know.”</p> \n<h2>‘You get odder, don’t you, as you get older’<br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Ian Martin meets Gill, Lancaster </strong></p> \n<p>Could you find a lonely neighbour, the Guardian said, and invite them into your home? No, I said, using that gruff tone reserved for Bulletins From The Real World. Waste of time, mate. We live in a terraced house. In a cul-de-sac. In the north. Bosh. Hoist by my own smugtard. That’s great, said the Guardian: you live in a community where people <em>aren’t</em> isolated. Find someone on your road over 65, have them in for a coffee.</p> \n<p>Who’s lonely here? The older singles have lodgers, or church, or <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/yoga\">yoga </a>… I see Gill, who has lived on her own here for 32 years, in the street. I explain what the deal is – “Haha, imagine anyone being lonely in this street of nosey bastards”. There’s a beat and she says, “Well, I <em>am</em> lonely.” It takes me by surprise. But my stupid brain is saying keep the mood upbeat so I hear myself saying, “Oh, you are? That’s perfect”. Then she has to dash off. I spend the rest of the day quietly mortified. Pillock.</p> \n<p>The next morning she comes over for a two-hour caffeinated chat. Ironically, when I had stopped her she was on her way to a public inquiry about a building development at the edge of a nearby field, currently acres of deep green emptiness punctuated by two wonky, rusted goalposts. The sort of place you exercise a dog or kick a ball around or take your grandson to throw stones in the beck.</p> \n<p>So she’s a community activist. She participates in Lancaster’s <a href=\"http://www.u3a.org.uk/\">University of the Third Age</a> programme. She has friends and acquaintances, fellow allotment holders, neighbours, pets. But weekends are when she feels loneliest, when her friends in couples are doing couple things. She maintains perspective – she doesn’t go long without speaking to anyone, she would just like more contact sometimes. As she says: “I know that if I wasn’t seen for a couple of days, everyone would be going, ‘Is she dead, has the dog eaten her?’” A terrible thought for a vegetarian. Which incidentally must be one reason she’s in such great nick for 66. The same age as John Waters, who <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/oct/12/john-waters-on-hitchhiking-across-the-us\">hitchhiked across the US from Baltimore to San Francisco</a>. We agree that would be a marvellous thing to do, if we were different people.</p> \n<p>We also agree that Hunt is a tosser – a “mad Christian” she calls him – cynically exploiting loneliness for a cost-free “Fourth Sector” initiative. Her occasional loneliness, she thinks, may just be hardwired. “In a way it’s who I am. Been in relationships, never married. You get odder, don’t you, as you get older.” Amen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"913b75f6172d9802b4876be07def7246fd7ea0b1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436805270646/d9e0aaa8-4b49-4379-940a-f4484b0350c8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'I thought, oh right, she thinks I'm the old person' ...

He’s one of Leith’s characters but we’ve never met. When I try to find an older person to invite round to talk life, loneliness, and Jeremy Hunt over a cup of tea, I’m appalled to realise I don’t know a single person over 60 in the city. So I text a couple of neighbours. Both instruct me to call Wallace, who runs a quirky bed and breakfast in an old assembly rooms. More than that, they strongly advise me to become his friend.</p> \n<p>Two days later he arrives at my flat half an hour early. Immaculately turned out in a checked shirt, trousers, and shined shoes, he looks full of stories and cheek. His hair is white, his hands shaky, and his milky blue eyes mischievous. He is 74, though when I refer to him as being in his mid-seventies, he pulls me up: “Could you stop saying that, honeybunch? I’m not going to be 75 until November!” He fusses over my dog – “come here dog-a-log and get your backside scratched” – and tells me he’s had three during his life: “But I can’t have one now in case guests are allergic. Maybe one day, if I decide to be lonely, I’ll get a dog.”</p> \n<p>Wallace was born in 1940 and brought up in “the luxurious part of Glasgow known as Shettleston”. He studied furniture and interior design at <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/education/glasgowschoolofart\">Glasgow School of Art</a> (living on Otago Street where, thirty years later, I also lived), before being headhunted by <a href=\"http://www.pringlescotland.com/gb/\">Pringle of Scotland</a>. He was their design director for 20 years, first in the Borders then in New York, until “the screaming lady Karan” asked him to come on board as her menswear designer. Who? “<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/06/04/fashion/dkny-timeline.html?_r=0\">Donna Karan</a>,” comes the swift reply. Eventually he wound up in Italy, where he opened his first B&amp;B. Seven years ago, the same year I arrived on the street, he returned to Scotland to open <a href=\"http://www.wallacesarthousescotland.com/\">Wallace’s Arthouse</a>.</p> \n<p>“Now I’m thinking, what next?” he tells me. Would he consider settling down? “Are you nuts?” Yet he is thinking of closing the B’n’B in a couple of years. “After that, I’m looking to move into someone’s garden shed. Ideally <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/nicola-sturgeon\">Nicola Sturgeon</a>’s. I have to face up to the fact that physically I’m not going to get stronger. I can’t just wait around until one day I have to go into an old folks’ home.”</p> \n<p>Wallace is in good health, though he has diabetes and a degenerative eye condition. But he is single, without children, and his closest family live near London. Does he worry about his future? “Yes, of course,” he says. “Don’t we all? I’m not an old person who sits around wondering what to do with themselves, though I can understand loneliness.”</p> \n<p>What does he make of Hunt’s notion of combating loneliness among older people by inviting them round for tea and encouraging relatives to live with them? “To be honest, I had it the other way round,” he confesses. “When you called, I thought, oh shit, I never invite any old people over for a cup of tea.” He laughs. “Then I arrived, you made me a cup of tea and I thought, oh, right. She thinks I’m the old person.”</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436811088951/b2fd78af-fd01-4036-9ddf-d5d5b9eee353-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Levene/David Levene","altText":"Teatime for Homa Khaleeli and Frances.

The occasion was a party to celebrate the premiere of the fifth season of Game of Thrones, Sky’s fantasy drama of intrigues and violent strife: guests were offered a tour of the crown jewels and escorted by Beefeaters to the white tower for drinks before watching the show.</p> \n<p>The former culture secretary was <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/corporate2/insidethebbc/managementstructure/biographies/purnell_james\" title=\"\">James Purnell</a>, the 45-year-old ex-Labour politician and now director of strategy and digital at the BBC. The future holder of the post was <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">John Whittingdale</a>, at 55 the backbench Conservative MP for the pleasant Essex town of Maldon (famed for a battle between Saxons and Vikings during the reign of Ethelred the Unready and the production of gourmet salt flakes beloved of the Waitrose classes). At the time, Whittingdale was the chair of the parliamentary select committee on culture, media and sport, which had just published a <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/culture-media-and-sport-committee/inquiries/parliament-2010/future-of-the-bbc/\" title=\"\">report</a> into the future of the BBC that mooted the end of the licence fee that provides &pound;3.7bn of its &pound;4.8bn income. A holder of a handful of shadow ministerial positions in the early 2000s, he had thus far languished unpromoted under David Cameron’s leadership. The two fell amiably into conversation – during the course of which Purnell predicted that Whittingdale would be the next culture secretary. To everyone else’s surprise, Whittingdale’s most of all, he was right. When Cameron shuffled his newly minted majority Conservative government on 11 May, Whittingdale received a summons to No 10 – to be offered, he assumed, a junior ministerial post in some uncongenial department. Instead, the incumbent at the culture ministry, Sajid Javid, was promoted to business, and Whittingdale was offered culture. It was a “bombshell”, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11687504/John-Whittingdale-interview-I-am-not-going-to-war-with-the-BBC.html\" title=\"\">Whittingdale has said</a> – this was his “dream job”.</p> \n<p>Whittingdale and Purnell are now playing lead roles in a struggle that matters to everyone in Britain – and many beyond its shores: the renewal of the BBC’s royal charter, which sets the scope and scale of the corporation, and which must be settled – replacing the agreement forged in 2006 – by the end of 2016. Purnell’s job is to forge the case for maintaining the BBC’s size and reach, and to help fashion a compelling plan for its future. Whittingdale, after his years of scrutinising the corporation, now has the opportunity to put his views into action.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/jul/01/bbc-inform-educate-entertain-order\">The BBC informs, educates and entertains – but in what order? | Charlotte Higgins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A green paper setting out the government’s position will be published this week, and the Tories have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/12/bbc-charter-review-green-paper-licence-fee-chief-funding\" title=\"\">already briefed its most significant proposals to the press</a>. These include a “root and branch” review of the BBC’s mission and operations, guided by a panel of outside experts –<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/12/bbc-charter-review-what-the-panel-members-have-said-in-the-past\" title=\"\"> many of whom are critical of the BBC</a> – that is almost certain to challenge everything from the licence fee to the corporation’s mandate to provide “universal” programming. Soon afterwards, the BBC’s response will be laid out by director general <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/tony-hall\" title=\"\">Tony Hall</a> in a series of speeches over the summer and autumn. A white paper will probably follow early next year, with a settlement expected next summer.</p> \n<p>Some observers are looking forward to a bloody battle. Whittingdale, who worked as an aide to Norman Tebbit in the early 1980s and then as Margaret Thatcher’s political adviser (he was dubbed “Maggie’s toy boy” in a cheeky tabloid headline of the time) has aired views on the BBC that are either dangerously rightwing or crisply radical, according to taste. When Cameron announced his new team – a cabinet elated and liberated by the unexpected election result – the Daily Telegraph’s gleeful headline was: “Tories go to war with the BBC”. The leaked details of the forthcoming green paper suggest a dramatic confrontation over the corporation’s very purpose, centred on competing definitions of “public-service broadcasting”. The green paper will contemplate scrapping the licence fee, propose that the BBC’s news website be diminished to protect commercial rivals, and question the political impartiality of BBC News.</p> \n<p>The situation for the BBC is perilous. Despite the steadying presence of Hall, who became director general in April 2013, the memory of a string of recent disasters is still fresh. Hall’s immediate predecessor, George Entwistle, resigned on 11 November 2012 after just 54 days in the role, following a pair of catastrophes relating to the current affairs show Newsnight. The first concerned the show’s decision not to air an investigation into sexual abuse perpetrated by the late BBC entertainer Jimmy Savile; the second was the mistaken naming on social media of a former Conservative party treasurer, Lord McAlpine, as a paedophile. The extent of Savile’s crimes, committed while he was being promoted into a national star by the BBC, dented trust in the corporation.</p> \n<p>At the same time, lavish severance packages given to departing executives caused a public scandal: one deputy director general had been awarded over &pound;1m “just to walk out of the door”, as a furious Jeremy Paxman succinctly put it to me. One of Hall’s first acts as director general was to cap payoffs at &pound;150,000, but the perfume of extravagance lingers. These and other crises opened up the corporation to vicious attacks from its bitter long-term critics in the press and its commercial rivals.</p> \n<p>On top of that, the body created to oversee the corporation and act on behalf of its audiences, replacing the old system of governors – the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/bbc-trust\" title=\"\">BBC Trust</a> – has been found wanting, and will almost certainly be abolished after only 10 years in place. More serious for the BBC’s income is the strong probability that the government will decriminalise non-payment of the &pound;145.50 licence fee – a move that Cameron has indicated he will make sooner rather than later – which would cost the corporation an estimated &pound;200m per annum as evasion increases, as it surely will, if criminal sanctions end.</p> \n<p>All the while, the BBC is under constant siege by those sections of the press – mostly on the political right – that feel their businesses are threatened by the corporation’s size, or their worldview challenged by what they claim as leftwing bias in the BBC’s news coverage. Since the dispatch of its favourite quarry Ed Miliband into insignificance, the Daily Mail has reserved some of its strongest vitriol for the BBC – including an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/may/27/daily-mail-bbc-lefties-guardian\" title=\"\">outraged news article</a> revealing that the BBC spent &pound;127,643 last year to purchase copies of the “left-leaning” Guardian, and only &pound;40,482 on the Mail, a calculation that conveniently omitted the disparity in cover price between the two papers. Rupert Murdoch’s Sun has also weighed in, as have the Times and the Telegraph, in their own more sober way. (“The BBC’s broadcasting model,” according to one Telegraph editorial, “is as outdated as the vast state-funded monolith that runs it”.) The BBC has always been the butt of criticism from its rivals: the Daily Mail, for instance, has been sniping at the corporation since the 1920s. Accusations of mismanagement and gross inefficiency were rife in the 1980s. Directors general – Hugh Carleton Greene in the 1960s, Alasdair Milne in the 1980s, Greg Dyke in the 2000s – were ousted through combinations of political enmity and editorial calamity. But as it goes into battle to defend the terms of its existence, never, perhaps, have the forces ranged against the BBC been so many and varied.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>The events of the past weeks,</strong> as a newly empowered Conservative administration has flexed its muscles, give an eloquent sense of the danger that the BBC is in, and how little power it has to withstand government incursions. On Wednesday 8 July the chancellor, George Osborne, erased &pound;630m from the BBC’s income <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/06/bbc-pay-cost-free-tv-licences-over-75s-fee-deal\" title=\"\">at the stroke of a pen</a>.</p> \n<p>The attack came suddenly. There was no debate, consultation or anything approaching a public process. On Monday 29 June, Hall received a telephone call from Whittingdale, informing him that Osborne would be requiring the BBC to take on the cost of providing free licence fees for people over 75 – which had been shouldered by the Department for Work and Pensions since 2001, when the then chancellor Gordon Brown introduced them as a pre-election giveaway. It was always a dangerous move for the BBC, since it shunted a portion of its funding out of the realm of the relatively protected licence fee and into the gift of a government department, subject to the turbulent tides of politics.</p> \n<p>For a zealous chancellor fresh into his second term, who has promised further spending cuts and deficit reduction, shrugging off the cost of these licence fees was irresistible: &pound;630m (rising to &pound;750m by 2020) was a considerable sum to lose from Osborne’s balance sheet. Whittingdale, whose select committee had in fact urged against such a move, was a mere messenger: his tidings on 29 June were that there was to be no discussion, simply imposition. Hall responded that to make such a move would be tantamount to dropping an atomic bomb on the BBC. It would result in the nation losing, within as little as three years, huge chunks of services: BBC2, or the whole of local radio.</p> \n<p>The one big card that the BBC could have played was to go public with the intended move, refuse to sign on the dotted line, and attempt to invoke its viewers, users and supporters as allies in open conflict with the government. This was a move it had been prepared to make, but in the view of BBC tacticians, it would have been worthwhile only if the Department for Culture, Media and Sport had the clout and will to weigh in subtly and effectively on the BBC’s side.<strong> </strong>But the department has been enfeebled by cuts since 2010, and, quite apart from his views on the BBC, Whittingdale was the new boy, still learning the government ropes. Relying on the culture department as an intercessor with the most powerful figures in government would, it was decided, put the BBC at risk of being ripped apart.</p> \n<p>And so Hall began negotiations directly with Osborne, bypassing the still green culture secretary. A quickly assembled team within the BBC began calculating potential offsets to the shortfall, figuring out the value of concessions Hall could attempt to wrench from the chancellor. He managed a commitment, conditional on the satisfactory outcome of the charter discussions, to an index-linked rise in the licence fee; an end to the use of the fee to pay for broadband rollout; and the closing of a loophole in licence fee regulations, meaning that those who watch only catchup TV online will now be required to pay.</p> \n<p>This cluster of conversations – in person between Hall and Osborne at the Treasury, and via telephone – took place over a matter of a few days before the budget speech on 8 July. The process, if one could call it that, was nasty, brutal and short.</p> \n<p>The first battle in the BBC war had, then, been fought – a bloody assault that will have serious consequences for the corporation, despite Hall’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/07/tony-hall-licence-fee-deal-bbc-dwp-george-osborne\" title=\"\">insistence that he has achieved</a> a “strong deal”. But there is more to come. Between now and this time next year the future scale and scope of the BBC will hang in the balance.<strong> </strong>On the government side, the question is whether the BBC is doing too much: whether it should be pruned back hard in order to allow more space for other businesses (including newspaper websites); whether parts of it ought to be privatised; and whether, in a world of media abundance, it needs to be a universal service, providing something for everyone. On the BBC side, there will be a desire to create a new governance structure to secure the corporation from precisely such assaults as the one it has just suffered, to present a compelling future plan for the BBC in a maturing digital world, to protect the income from its commercial activities – and, most important of all, to demonstrate that it still holds a precious place at the centre of British national life.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>John Whittingdale has given only one</strong> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/bbc/11687504/John-Whittingdale-interview-I-am-not-going-to-war-with-the-BBC.html\" title=\"\">newspaper interview </a>since his elevation, to the Sunday Telegraph, which he used to deny its sister paper’s headline that his appointment signalled a “war” against the BBC. (As soon as the original story was published, one senior BBC employee told me, calls came in to Broadcasting House from “officials, advisers, ministers, everyone”, to reassure the corporation that open combat was not the intention.) Last year, though, while I was researching a book on the BBC, Whittingdale and I talked at length, and I had the chance to hear his personal views laid out clearly, unfiltered by realpolitik.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/12/rona-fairhead-bbc-trust-licence-fee-resign\">Rona Fairhead: ‘The word of a chancellor you should be able to trust’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On a February morning, we sat in the canteen at Portcullis House – the building that houses MPs’ offices in Westminster – amid the self-important waltz of special advisers, MPs and lobbyists. Whittingdale was pleasant, well-informed, and firm in his opinions. He began by situating the BBC according to his own political compass. “I am a free-market Conservative, and therefore begin with the presumption that generally things operate better if they are in private ownership and operate in a market,” he said. “So the question is, do we need a BBC? And my answer to that has always been yes, because there are things that are in the public interest to have that would probably not be viable on a commercial basis.”</p> \n<p>Public-service broadcasting “doesn’t just mean narrow programmes about Guatemalan hill tribes’ eating habits; it actually does extend into high-quality drama, risky material, arts and culture, news and current affairs at the core, religion, education, children”, he said. But, he continued: “There are some areas where I think the BBC is way outside the definition of what I call public-service broadcasting, shows where quite obviously they are copying a format which is already available in the market, such as The Voice … Is there a public-service argument for Strictly? Debatable. Is there a public-service argument for putting out Strictly at roughly the same time as ITV is running X Factor? No. The one thing in my view the BBC should not be thinking about is ratings, but they do because of the licence fee. That’s the problem.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Public-service broadcasting doesn’t just mean narrow programmes about Guatemalan hill tribes’ eating habits</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>John Whittingdale</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The licence fee created a false logic, he argued. Because it was in effect universally chargeable (being dependent on a household’s owning a television) it demanded that the BBC act universally, that is, to create something for everyone: popular programmes for everyone to enjoy, as well as niche programmes to serve minorities. But universality, Whittingdale contended, was unnecessary in today’s world of proliferating choice – and indeed undesirable, as it disadvantaged commercial broadcasters lacking the BBC’s enormous funding advantage.</p> \n<p>He was against the licence fee for other reasons, too: “It’s very regressive, it’s very expensive to collect, you get these ridiculous letters threatening you with having your fingernails pulled out if you don’t admit that actually you’ve got a television hidden somewhere … and the level of evasion is pretty high, and <a href=\" http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/24/in-court-non-payment-tv-licence-television-desperate-cases\" title=\"\">quite a number of people go to prison</a> for failing to pay the fine.” He referred admiringly to a report that he had commissioned when he was briefly shadow culture secretary in the early 2000s, by a team including <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/david-elstein\" title=\"\">David Elstein</a>, an eloquent critic of the BBC who started as a trainee at the corporation before working for Thames, Sky, Channel 5 and others. That pamphlet, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2004/feb/24/broadcasting.politicsandthemedia\" title=\"\">Beyond the Charter</a> (2004), advocated abolition of the licence fee, a move to subscription for BBC TV and the creation of a Public Broadcasting Authority funded by the Treasury, to which the BBC would be entitled to apply for funding, along with other broadcasters. “I still think it is brilliant, I still think that it stands the test of time,” Whittingdale said of the report. But when it was published, he added, “the political climate wasn’t right, Michael Howard was leading the Tory party, he didn’t want to fight with the BBC, it disappeared.”</p> \n<p>Beyond the Charter also mooted the BBC’s moving away from making TV programmes altogether, an idea of which Whittingdale also approved – except for “news and current affairs” and “arguably I’d keep David Attenborough, because that is such a big specialist field, the natural history unit”. He talked too, about the notion of outsourcing some commissioning to other public-service bodies such as, say, the British Museum or the Royal Shakespeare Company.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"cb3e63ac3dfe707f56b3023fa3f9b31d07b1bacc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436790504089/8e59491f-081f-41dc-a103-8043d9856c88-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"David Attenborough presents The Private Life of Plants in 1993.

His enthusiasm was partly familial: his son, at the time in his final year at Bristol University, regarded it as “still the greatest station on the planet” and had convinced his father of its importance in introducing new bands to a wide audience, in contrast to commercial stations with narrower playlists. (Ben Cooper, the controller of the network had also “very kindly” – not to mention presciently under the circumstances – invited Whittingdale junior to visit Radio 1’s HQ.) Whittingdale senior, a fan of Meat Loaf and Deep Purple, also told me that “I don’t think there’s enough heavy metal on Radio 1”.</p> \n<p>More significantly, he had trenchant views on the manner in which the BBC managed itself, and the size of its workforce, which stands at about 21,000. “The BBC is the most wasteful, bloated organisation on the planet,” he asserted. “Chris Patten [the BBC Trust’s former chairman] used to make jokes about the army of the People’s Republic of China being the organisation that’s the closest he’s encountered to the BBC: it is just huge numbers of people, many of whom don’t appear to be doing anything. And every person I talk to in the BBC tears their hair out about all these people with mad titles. You know, the BBC is full of directors of sustainability and all those other sort of ridiculous titles” – the kind of thing satirised by the BBC’s own <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/15/w1a-bbc-licence-fee-john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">comedy about itself</a>, W1A. The notorious payoffs were a “disaster”; and there were “quite worrying reports of bullying culture which is just being swept under the carpet”. Nor should the BBC be paying vast sums to stars. “I have long taken the view that to some extent the BBC is an incubator, the BBC is there to identify talent, to groom talent, but not necessarily to keep talent. If someone – be it Jonathan Ross or Jeremy Clarkson [this was before the latter’s abrupt departure from Top Gear] becomes so successful that he has to be paid a million pounds or he will go to ITV, then let him go.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The BBC is the most wasteful, bloated organisation on the planet: there are all these people with mad titles</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>John Whittingdale</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I asked him what he would do, in the then unimaginable scenario that he were in charge of charter renewal. He said that he would end the licence fee and pay for the BBC from “straight exchequer funding” (from, for example, income tax). That would mean “it would obviously be subject to the same pressures as every other form of public spending”. (Even more significantly, it would be directly subject to the changing tides of political favour, arguably compromising its independence). He concluded: “My private view has always been that you have a much smaller BBC doing a much more targeted output of clear public-service content.” Given his narrow definition of public-service broadcasting, it sounded very much as if his ideal BBC would not be doing a lot.</p> \n<p>Taken as a whole, Whittingdale’s vision seemed to point to a BBC much diminished, one no longer part of the weft and warp of national life. His was a BBC as, largely, publisher rather than maker (and sometimes not even that). It was a BBC that would be closer to US broadcasters such as NPR or PBS, providing highminded material for the few, rather than collective, popular experience for the many. It was a BBC slimmed down into a space easily crowded by the great titans of commercial broadcasting from the US. It would be a partially gutted BBC, stripped of popular high-budget dramas and widely viewed entertainment shows such as Great British Bake Off or Strictly; nor would it employ stars. By definition, it would be marginal. It would be poorer, for it would lack the great export shows, such as Top Gear and Sherlock, that make it money overseas. It would simply not be the BBC as we know it. And in turn, I could not help feeling, since the BBC is so fundamentally wrapped into the nation’s sense of itself, it would no longer be Britain as we know it.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Since its foundation in 1922,</strong> the BBC’s natural state, like that of the Roman empire, has been one of expansion. Of its rapid growth (from four employees in 1922 to 5,100 in 1939), Malcolm Muggeridge wrote in his book The Thirties: “The BBC came to pass silently, invisibly; like a coral reef, cells busily multiplying, until it was a vast structure …” The BBC grew as the wireless craze of the 1930s took hold; then grew again when television came, and again when colour was introduced, and on and on. And it worked: every time a householder bought a licence in increasingly prosperous postwar Britain, it benefited everyone else, because it went into the great shared broadcasting pot to be distributed back to the populace as a super-abundant supply of information, education and entertainment. As <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/may/15/bbc-director-generals-reith-birt-dyke\" title=\"\">John Reith</a>, the BBC’s founding director general, wrote, broadcasting “is a reversal of the natural law, that the more one takes, the less there is for others … There is no limit to the amount that may be drawn off”.</p> \n<p>The times and technologies have changed, however. We are in a new age of on-demand, of choice and subscription and streaming. We are in an age in which the BBC’s dominance in our lives is shaken not only by Sky and Channel 4 and ITV, but by Netflix and Amazon, Apple and Google. Once, the BBC stood alone, grand and proud like a great edifice on the horizon – I think of old photographs of St Paul’s Cathedral, which, even in my lifetime, humbled the shabbier and smaller edifices around it. Now that horizon is crowded by the new vainglorious towers of capital. What was once vast is now dwarfed. Hall told me last year: “I think we are at the end of a period of, as it were, unbridled expansion of the BBC. We’re now in a period when we have to define much, much more carefully what it is the BBC offers and what is it the BBC can do …” He was contemplating acts of retrenchment, such as the moving of BBC3 – the channel much loved by younger and lower-income viewers – to an online-only service, which the BBC Trust has now ratified. Hall is, perhaps, the Hadrian of the BBC’s emperors, the first non-expansionist who tactically withdrew from troubled territory and concentrated on consolidating his borders. The policy brought stability, but the empire had reached its territorial peak.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/apr/15/bbc-origins-future\">What can the origins of the BBC tell us about its future? | Charlotte Higgins</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What Hall and his colleagues see as consolidation is, nonetheless, utterly opposed to Whittingdale’s vision, which strikes at the principle, carefully husbanded since the 1920s that its service should be universal, providing for all tastes and reaching all people.</p> \n<p>In 1924, Reith wrote in his book Broadcast Over Britain: “It does not matter how many thousands there may be listening; there is always enough for others, when they too wish to join in. It is the perquisite of no particular class or faction ... There is no first and third class. There is nothing in it which is exclusive to those who pay more.” The BBC is still clinging fiercely to the Reithian principle that the corporation exists to do more than to plug the gaps left by commercial broadcasters – that it creates the invisible but strong filaments of shared national memory, emotion and experience that bind every inhabitant of these islands together. That is the vision that the BBC would like to sustain. That is the vision that gives it philosophical licence to provide something for everyone, from 1Xtra to Wolf Hall, and the means and heft to ensure it can.<strong> </strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"413122eca07e63c9ec3da076d9cdeb69bbf0486c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436789826747/5ba79984-4d12-4cda-8e61-b6b8cfcfaa2e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolf Hall is the sort of high-quality programme favoured by Whittingdale.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wolf Hall is the sort of high-quality programme favoured by Whittingdale.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giles Keyte/Giles Keyte/BBC/Company Productions Ltd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I met Hall recently in the House of Lords, where he sits as a crossbencher. Hall took me to the Royal Gallery, a grandiose room dominated by Daniel Maclise’s vast depictions of the Battles of Waterloo and Trafalgar. He is an unflamboyant man, his accent bearing the faintest hint of his native Birkenhead. Directors general of the BBC tend to be defined in relation to their predecessors. If John Birt was process-obsessed and managerial, Greg Dyke was warm and demotic. Mark Thompson was thick-skinned and clever; George Entwistle straightforward but inexperienced. In this pattern Hall has his place as a BBC old-timer (he ran news and current affairs in the 1990s, and inherits something of the strategic aura of his former boss, Birt). But he is also, crucially, someone who has seen life on the outside, spending a decade as chief executive of the Royal Opera House before he was called back to the ailing BBC, Cincinnatus-like, in April 2013. Just as Whittingdale was not expecting to become culture secretary, Hall had ruled out a return to the BBC until events intervened. Safeguarding the BBC is the unlooked-for apogee of the 64-year-old’s career. He will not want to fail.</p> \n<p>I have spoken with Hall many times; on this occasion I sensed that the pace of his professional life had intensified, that the endgame was upon him: his loins were girded for an endless round of speeches and public appearances, of intense private meetings with the government, of planning sessions with his closest colleagues. Of judiciously timed announcements designed to press home certain messages about the BBC – its increased efficiency, its positive impact on the British economy, its creative strengths. All the while he was presiding over the vast citadel of the BBC, pacing the ramparts to guard against crises and scandals that could scupper the best-laid of plans.<strong> </strong></p> \n<p>He marshalled some of his arguments. The Reithian tricolon – “inform, educate and entertain” – he said, was still urgent and valid: paid for by a licence fee, free at the point of delivery, and made cheap, good and possible because of the fact that the whole nation shared in it. The BBC was essentially an Enlightenment force, making knowledge and information available to all. It did not inhibit the growth of the markets in which it operated, Hall argued, but was a catalyst for the creative economy, the fastest-growing part of “UK plc”. The BBC would become “genuinely porous”, an enabler for creative people and organisations around Britain, rather than a closed fortress. Forty-six million Britons use the BBC for 18 hours a week, he reminded me, <a href=\"http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/howwework/accountability/pdf/summary_audience_information_july_sept_2014.pdf\" title=\"\">according to the corporation’s research</a>. It is part of Britain, he said, a fact that is recognised all over the world – it is only in Britain itself that this sometimes appears in doubt. The BBC must remain a programme-maker; it must have its own intellectual property in the globalised media world. “You could fund it by subscription,” he said, “but it wouldn’t be the BBC. I believe utterly in universality.”</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>If Tony Hall is the commander-in-chief</strong> of the BBC’s operation&nbsp;to secure the BBC, James Purnell is his top strategist. He is an unruffled presence, both in temperament and dress, the sort of man whose shirt cuffs are a precise distance from the end of his jacket sleeves and whose mind is similarly ordered. He is the leader of a team of thinkers whose arguments, they hope, will prove unassailable. There is James Heath, the head of policy, who worked for Labour culture secretary Chris Smith in the 1990s and later for ITV; there is Gautam Rangarajam, head of the strategy unit, an intellectually able former radio producer who is a semi-professional choirman in his spare time; and John Shield, director of communications, a man of steely calm who has moved across to the BBC from government. I asked Purnell, in his comfortable little office in Old Broadcasting House, how he intends to close the gap between his and Whittingdale’s positions. Second-guessing what might appear acceptable to the government was a mug’s game, Purnell argued. “The BBC can tie itself up in knots trying to work out what will be convincing to people. Actually it’s a very popular organisation and you should just go out and make the arguments on their merits, with evidence.” He added: “You can squeeze a very ambitious version of the BBC into the argument that it is an organisation that exists to correct market failure. Arguably, it might be more persuasive. But it’s not true. This is clearly a life-enhancing service that meets public goals we have as a society.”</p> \n<p>In the field, Shield is fighting on the flank. “I think the BBC, as an organisation with such an important role in public life, has been, on the whole, remarkably shy in making a case for why it exists, and equally challenging attacks that are made upon it,” he told me from the press office, a room full of furrow-browed workers who by turns parried attacks from the rightwing press and supplied the same papers with stories about beloved television stars. In a departure from previous practice – the BBC has hitherto tended to absorb attacks without commenting publicly – Shield and his team, especially since the election, have become much more assertive, taking to Twitter to issue detailed rebuttals of reporting they regard as unfair or inaccurate. (For example, in the case of the article about how much the BBC spent on the Guardian by comparison to the Mail, the press office tweeted: “Daily Mail says buying 80,679 copies of Guardian is evidence of ‘left leaning bias’ at BBC. Doesn’t mention the fact we bought 78,436 Mails.”)</p> \n<p>There is no fixed pattern for renewing a BBC charter.<strong> </strong>Each round of negotiations has its own character. A charter may last for any period, but usually 10 years, which grants a certain stability. This time around, the government is keen for a five-year charter, allowing for consideration of a replacement for the licence fee. In 1996, John Birt secured a deal with the government “giving us all that we could have wished for” (as he put it in his autobiography, The Harder Path) – a 10-year deal that staved off privatisation, allowed huge commercial expansion, and retained the licence fee. Since his arrival at the corporation in 1987, he had been neutralising the Conservative government’s hostility to a BBC it saw as leftwing, inefficient and disaster-prone. First he reformed BBC news, introducing specialist reporters and tightening editorial controls; then he introduced an internal market, made thousands redundant and prepared for a digital future.</p> \n<p>Birt’s actions were deeply divisive within the corporation, and he was the target of real loathing. In retrospect, every headline about misery inside the BBC probably helped its cause with the government. As the deadline for charter renewal approached, he instituted a dozen “taskforces” of staffers to help build up arguments for the BBC. The young Tony Hall was the chair of one of these groups, who were assisted by the management consultants McKinsey (an expensive luxury, even at reduced rates). Aside from the taskforces, there were lavish three-course lunches for backbench MPs, boxes at the Proms and seats at Wimbledon for “opinion formers”, and consultations, with buffet lunches, for special-interest groups (such as religious representatives), organised by Biddy Baxter, the longtime editor of Blue Peter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1da7475d8b594fe3f6717c15f11c3ba69113638d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436806350069/dc7e9ce5-df5f-4251-bb85-2e22f686da49-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Strictly Come Dancing.

Culture secretary John Whittingdale questions whether the BBC should make such programmes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Levy/BBC/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Persuasion aided by such opulence would be unthinkable now. “It will be all much more Calvinist this time,” said Purnell. There will be much in the way of public rhetoric from&nbsp;Hall and others; and much activity behind closed doors, too. A former employee of the culture department, who has worked on previous charter renewals, described a constant shuttling of proposals and counter-proposals between the BBC&nbsp;and the government; endless lobbying of the secretary of&nbsp;state by interested parties; “a lot of noises off; a lot of screaming and shouting”. Inside government, ministers will have their own deals to make with Whittingdale, promising support in return for his, or their own, pet projects. Special advisers will be calculating the potential political fallout of certain courses of action. The culture department will be “churning out documents on various options”. On previous occasions, the proposed charter renewal agreement has been&nbsp;signed off by the cabinet economic affairs committee, which is currently chaired by Osborne. Whittingdale will need&nbsp;to achieve cabinet unanimity – and the approval of the chancellor and prime minister. But, the former official stressed, there was no fixed pattern, no rules. The government could frame the process as it pleased. It could “take months, or an afternoon”.</p> \n<p>The current BBC fighting force arguably lacks a crucial resource: time. As the former culture department official told me in June: “The longer the process is, the better it can be for the BBC – they can argue their point, get more people on their side, and have more time to scare the public about what might be taken away from them if the BBC is diminished. But this time, the government has all the cards. With an enfeebled department of culture and strong views about the BBC in government, the BBC can be very quickly outwitted.” So events have already proved.</p> \n<p>According to David Elstein, the corporation can expect a much tougher ride with Whittingdale than his equivalents under Thatcher or Major. Whittingdale is, he believes, in a strong position to act on his impulses: he has manifesto commitment to freeze the licence fee, a select committee report in his back pocket advocating its eventual end, and decriminalisation of non-payment of the fee on its way: “He’s already got three aces in his hand and the issue is will he have a full house or will he have four aces. You know, he’s got the winning hand.” The unknown factor, as yet, is how Cameron and Osborne will assess the potential political fallout of appearing to dismantle the BBC as we know it. Despite the best efforts of parts of the press, the BBC remains more popular with Conservative voters than the electorate overall. Margaret Thatcher harboured a deep loathing of the BBC (“leftwing, monopolistic, anti-her”, as Charles Moore, her biographer, put it to me). And yet she lacked the political appetite to raze it. The last Conservative majority government may have opened the door to Rupert Murdoch’s Sky, but they did not, as was widely feared at the time, privatise the BBC or compel it to fund itself through advertising.</p> \n<p>“Our programmes are in the end are our strongest card. And if there were ever a real threat to the BBC, or to Radio 4 – the strongest supporters of the BBC are Conservative voters,” Purnell said. A senior manager at the BBC told me he believed that the Conservatives will still be in power in a decade, which may work in the BBC’s favour. If the Conservatives really wish to take the centre ground, and stay in power for the foreseeable future, then protecting the NHS, schools, the BBC, might be a politically canny thing to do. So runs one calculation.</p> \n<p>Until 1926, the BBC had operated as a company, its board composed of wireless manufacturers. It was John Reith who argued that the broadcaster was more than a business: it was a public service. And so it needed to be run like one, governed in the public interest. With remarkable generosity, the board members accepted this with barely a murmur. They were handed back their original investments at par. As the Economist of 13 March 1926 put it, “there is no question of compensation”. In turn those directors handed over the company to the nation, to be overseen by independent governors acting in the people’s interests. (The same Economist article praised the notion that because no part of the BBC was reliant on direct government funding, it would be protected “against the raids of even the most predatory chancellor of the exchequer” – but the author could be forgiven for then not foreseeing the rococo politicking of figures such as Brown and Osborne.)</p> \n<p>The question for the country now, and its politicians, is whether the BBC’s founding vision still has any currency; whether the BBC can still be something different from a media business and something more than a “content provider”. Can it still be part of the essence of Britishness, existing as a public space through which we may all pass as equals, selling us nothing, simply there for our information, education and entertainment? Can it remain our “guide, philosopher and friend”, as Reith had it? In the end, these are questions that cut to the heart of what British society consists of, and what kind of nation we want to be. It is an argument that the BBC can win or lose; and it is in the newly empowered Conservatives’ gift to decide its fate. All that could possibly stand in the government’s way is the will of the people. Britain will have the BBC it deserves.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Follow the Guardian long read on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\" title=\"\">@gdnlongread</a></p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This New Noise by Charlotte Higgins (Guardian Faber, &pound;12.99).
