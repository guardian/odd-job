In many cities, more visible crimes have fallen: in New York in 1990, the homicide rate peaked with 2,245 murders; last year it saw a record low of 328. But new risks are emerging: terrorism is a serious concern for any major city, and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/cybercrime\">cyber crime</a> is a growing threat – as cities increasingly rely on technology and connectedness, everything from traffic lights to air-traffic control, even sewage systems, could be vulnerable to hackers.</p> \n<p>According to the <a href=\"http://safecities.economist.com/whitepapers/safe-cities-index-white-paper/\">Safe Cities Index</a>, put together by the <a href=\"http://www.eiu.com/home.aspx\">Economist’s Intelligence Unit </a>(EIU), the title of world’s safest goes to the city that is also the most populous: Tokyo. <br /></p> \n<p>The EIU looked at a wide range of factors when putting together the index. It examined digital security, and considered the number of cyber attacks and how they were tackled. It looked at the obvious area of personal safety, but also infrastructure security – sanitation, roads, and management of natural disasters. In the health security category, it looked at quality of healthcare (for instance, how many hospital beds and doctors there were per 1,000 people), but also at issues such as pollution. As the report puts it, “Living in a safe and healthy urban environment can make a real and measurable difference to city inhabitants.” In the index’s top 25 cities, average life expectancy is 81; in the bottom half, it is 75.</p> \n<p>Tokyo scored highly across all categories. The report highlights its low crime rate, and how city planners improved quality of life by banning diesel cars to reduce pollution, and pedestrianising large parts of the centre.</p> \n<p>Before you start packing your bags, however, the conclusions aren’t simple: Tokyo also happens to be considered <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/gallery/2014/mar/25/earthquakes-hurricanes-cyclones-and-tsunamis-10-riskiest-cities-world\">the world’s riskiest city</a>, in part because of the huge number of people who would be harmed in an inevitable future earthquake. Nor does the report actually say which city is safest for <em>you</em>. From an individual’s point of view, as opposed to the municipal officials responsible for the smooth running of a city, isn’t personal safety more important than the threat of cyber crime? In that case, maybe you should look at Singapore instead. And what if health security is your priority, but you’ll take your chances on the streets? Move to Zurich: first for health, 13th for personal safety.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94b0554c01d5dba9b36edfd99c314455852b6156\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432050374825/cb26654d-e115-4dad-bdf5-34ed8873d5ea-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"In 2011 and 2013, Amsterdam was ranked safest for cyclists by urban planning consultancy the Copenhagenize Design Company.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In 2011 and 2013, Amsterdam was ranked safest for cyclists by urban planning consultancy the Copenhagenize Design Company.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David R Frazier Photolibrary/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Tokyo might be one of the safest cities but it also happens to be one of the riskiest</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Other studies have revealed other issues that might be of personal importance. Amsterdam, for instance, is – perhaps unsurprisingly – a good place to be a on a bike. In 2011 and 2013, the Dutch city was ranked <a href=\"http://copenhagenize.eu/index/index.html\">safest for cyclists</a> by urban planning consultancy the Copenhagenize Design Company, using criteria such as bicycle facilities, drivers’ attitudes, and political will to promote cycling. The sheer proliferation of cyclists helps – cycling in the city, notes the report, is “about as mainstream as you can get” – as does cycling infrastructure and a 30kph speed limit.</p> \n<p>There is no exhaustive ranking of the safest cities for women, but <a href=\"http://www.trust.org/spotlight/most-dangerous-transport-systems-for-women/?tab=results\">one survey</a> last year looked specifically at how safe women were on public transport. Up to 500 women were polled in 15 of the world’s capitals, plus New York. They were asked about their experiences of being verbally harassed or assaulted by men, travelling at night, the likelihood that other passengers would come to their aid, and whether they trusted that officials would investigate reports of violence. Of the cities surveyed, New York came out best, with Bogota, Mexico City and Lima faring worst; London was ranked fourth safest.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b801ebe4150a47f295b024e530c0aad3d1da9cf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432050621184/a3f759c6-efaf-4319-911e-c8a9a8fe06a4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"London was ranked fourth safest for women using public transport.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">London was ranked fourth safest for women using public transport.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But is it really possible, or even desirable, to rank cities according to their safety? “We are quite wary of doing that,” says Dr Michele Acuto, principal investigator for UCL’s <a href=\"http://www.cityleadership.net/#!3s-cities/c13sv\">City Leadership Initiative</a>, which is working with the UN on how to improve urban safety. “Rankings pit cities against each other. If you say London is safer than Manchester, it’s a blunt generalisation. You can say London has a lower crime rate than Manchester – that would be correct – but making judgements on safety is perception-based.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/gallery/2014/mar/25/earthquakes-hurricanes-cyclones-and-tsunamis-10-riskiest-cities-world\">Earthquakes, hurricanes, cyclones and tsunamis: the world's 10 riskiest cities</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>How do you make a city safer? Nobody wants to live in a police state. “You have to reduce crime, but it’s also things like improving safety of transport. If you make a city more sustainable, with more bike lanes, for instance, you can redesign it so that it’s also safer for pedestrians.” The wealth gap also has an important effect on a city’s safety: “There is no safer-city agenda that can proceed without a social-equality agenda,” says Acuto.</p> \n<p>And if there’s one factor you might want to consider as a sign of how safe your city is likely to be in future, look to the immigration rate. Studies in the US have shown that, far from what the anti-immigration lobby would have us believe, a city with more immigrants has lower crime rates. <a href=\"http://www.law.yale.edu/documents/pdf/Clinics/Sampson_Immigration_Contexts.pdf\">A study</a> by Robert J Sampson, professor of social sciences at Harvard University, found that first-generation immigrants were 45% less likely – and second-generation immigrants 22% less likely – to commit violence than third-generation Americans. As Sampson <a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/do-immigrants-make-us-safer-96377\">has summed it up</a>: “If you want to be safe, move to an immigrant city.”</p> \n<p></p>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432051875976/ced4b96d-08e1-4481-a29d-26076694876d-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy/Iain Masterton","altText":"Pedestrianisation of streets is considered to be a driver of a city's safety.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy/Iain Masterton"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432051162366/d2edbec0-fbf3-4df5-9aa0-498422ef03b9-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"In many cities, more visible crimes have fallen while terrorism and cyber crime are growing threats.

Along comes Alex James to shatter the illusion</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>First stop: the lido. Trustee Claire Jarvis talks me through the pool’s history, a story full to bursting with community spirit. <a href=\"http://www.chippylido.co.uk/about\" title=\"\">In the 1960s, local people raised the money</a> to build it. When, in 2002, a leisure centre was built in town and the district council decided to close the old lido, the community stepped in again, campaigning to save it. Now it’s a registered charity, run by the community, for the community.</p> \n<p>“All generations come here and mix, spend the whole afternoon, play on the grass and dip in and out – across all ages and every demographic,” says Claire. “It’s our day at the seaside.” (Chipping Norton is about as far as you can get from the actual seaside.) The local MP – also the PM – has been. The local Gypsy community frequent the place. True, Clarkson did once drive a Rolls-Royce into the pool for some TV show he used to be in, but they let him, because he also does the charity auction. On a chilly weekday there’s no one at all in the pool, but I’m getting a picture, on a hot summer day, of a kind of My Big Fat Classless Picnic Paradise, where everyone’s the same in a cossie.</p> \n<p>The wealth – and the set – is all outside the town, in the villages, Rupert and Claire explain. “People don’t appreciate the levels of deprivation,” says Claire. She tells me, proudly, that in the 1970s they had the highest proportion of social housing of any borough in western Europe. Does it make her cross when people get the wrong idea? “I nearly choked on my cornflakes,” she says about what I wrote. A Guardian reader, in Chipping frigging Norton! And a Labour voter – she’s still got the posters in her car. Rupert voted Green. In fact, two of Chipping Norton’s three regional ward councillors are Labour, a tiny island of red in an ocean of blue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6712f9c280e74619f35c75e1c49697441934a45f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432573987432/6108bce7-c011-4df7-8191-d649c0927bbb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Middle Row, Chipping Norton.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Middle Row, Chipping Norton.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the independent bookshop at one end of the pretty town square, I meet Jo Graves, who taught at the primary school for 20 years and now sits on the town council on an independent ticket. “I truly choked on my muesli,” she says. Oh gawd, not just a Guardian reader but an actual muesli-eating one, in Chipping frigging Norton. It was the ignorance of it that really annoyed her. Sure it might not be the working town it used to be, it has become gentrified (you only need to look at the cars and the prices in the estate agent windows), but there’s another side to it. And she, too, talks of the deprivation and poverty, the high proportion of council houses, the food bank, and – of course, the community. “I think that David Cameron got his ideas of the Big Society from Chipping Norton, because there is so much done in the community. I don’t think I know about any other society where, proportionally, so many people give up so much time voluntarily.” Jo describes the prime minister as “a very pleasant man and a very good constituency MP”. I’m finding it hard to find a bad word about him, even from people who might not agree with him politically. Bloody hell, they’re generous to everyone round here. Even the alpacas at Fairytale Farm, a sensory learning attraction for all the family, especially those with kids with disabilities, are friendly.</p> \n<p>To the theatre, where Anne Gill and Vanessa Managhan talk about the brilliant and extensive community (obviously) and the educational work they do, and Rupert tells me how a youth programme there made a such a big difference to the confidence of his son, now grown up and working for Thames Valley Police. At the Chipping Norton Community (!) Hospital, Jenny Nolan tells me about the <a href=\"http://www.lawrencehomenursing.org/\" title=\"\">Lawrence Home Nursing Team</a>, which provides care for local residents who want to die in their own homes. It’s very well supported by the local community, naturally; just the other day, they collected &pound;636.88 in a single morning. The PM, who was in town, contributed generously, of course. To both buckets.</p> \n<p>Time for a pint at the Red Lion where Experience Chipping Norton, a local organisation that promotes trade, tourism and – of course – community, is having a get-together to find out how they can help each other. It may not be the same kind of community spirit as you find on the Tilery Estate in Stockton-on-Tees, where single mum-of-six Julie helps out a neighbour who’s been turned down for a crisis loan, but this is a different kind of community. What’s become clear is that Chipping Norton doesn’t just have it, community spirit is Chipping Norton’s middle name. Chipping frigging community spirit Norton. I was wrong, I’m sorry.</p> \n<p>“It’s a very good community, very friendly,” says Tahirul Hasan, my taxi driver, on the way back to Kingham Station. Yeah, I know; I’m bored now – I’ve said sorry enough. And Hasan is not just a taxi driver, he’s a town councillor too, and a Tory. Ah, a true blue, at last. And, he says, the only non-white councillor in all Oxfordshire. He is also “very close to Mr David Cameron. He is a wonderful person.” And he shows me a picture on his phone of the two of them together, to prove it. And another with Jeremy Clarkson. Maybe I have finally met one of the Chipping Norton set – even if he is their least known and least likely member: a taxi driver in a people carrier from Bangladesh.</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432570214850/Old-english-roadsign-outs-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An old roadsign outside Chipping Norton in the  Cotswolds.

Under a UN-backed government resettlement scheme, Britain has given homes to just 187.</p> \n<p>Aid agencies and UN officials have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/feb/01/guardian-view-syrian-refugees-more-should-allowed-come-here\">called on the UK</a> to be more generous in its approach to supporting those fleeing the conflict, in which between 200,000 and 300,000 people have been killed. So far, around 200,000 Syrians have sought asylum in Europe; <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/ng-interactive/2015/mar/12/syria-refugees-new-life-germany-mozart-cosi-interactive\">Germany</a> has opened its doors to 30,000 under a similar scheme, but the UK has resisted expanding its programme.<br /></p> \n<p>The experiences of the 187 who have been formally welcomed reflect an asylum system at its best, at its most humane. Last year, the government and the <a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/\">UN’s refugee agency</a> launched the Vulnerable Persons Relocation (VPR) scheme to provide protection for particularly <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/vulnerable-persons-relocation-scheme-for-syrian-nationals\">vulnerable refugees</a>. Those who have been granted five years’ protection under the scheme express gratitude to the UK, but they also voice concern at the tiny numbers being given this help.</p> \n<p>Since the scheme is so restricted, thousands of other Syrians have independently made their way to the UK, and at great personal cost – paying out huge sums to traffickers, smuggling themselves in lorries from Calais, or risking their lives in unseaworthy ships across the Mediterranean. The perils of this journey have been recently illustrated by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/19/700-migrants-feared-dead-mediterranean-shipwreck-worst-yet\">boats that have sunk in the seas of southern Europe</a>. Away from the UN scheme, 4,200 Syrian nationals who have taken this unofficial route have been granted asylum or humanitarian protection by the UK – prompting refugee groups to ask why the UK doesn’t help reduce how many people are exposed to such risk, by increasing the numbers of those eligible for formal resettlement.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"393c7b3bb99c4202fe8955820eef649ef1521da5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432574257927/942154ad-2ecc-42b6-9a46-10fe3dc05441-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Around 12 million people have been displaced by the fighting in Syria.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Around 12 million people have been displaced by the fighting in Syria.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Omar Sanadiki/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>‘Everyone in Bradford speaks in their own special accent’</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Mohammed, a 20-year-old Syrian refugee who arrived in Britain a year ago, was housed with his family in Bradford. Although his experiences have been traumatic, his journey to Britain and relocation here have been entirely positive. He found out early in 2014 that he, his mother, and his two younger brothers, aged 11 and 17, were eligible to come to the UK under the VPR scheme.<br /></p> \n<p>In an interview in his new home, on the first anniversary of his arrival, he paid tribute to the programme. But he sees his own good fortune against the backdrop of what thousands of other refugees have had to go through. He cannot bear to watch footage of the refugee ships in trouble; it is the audio that he finds particularly upsetting, the voices that cry: “My child is in the water.”</p> \n<p>His family fled from Syria to Cairo in 2013, shortly after Mohammed’s father was killed while he travelled from the family home in Damascus to collect his own mother from the countryside and bring her to the relative safety of the city. Two days after his father had left, a friend called Mohammed to tell him that he had been killed, but it remains unclear how he died.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"30e85defffc7fa737f04a10c261b80dfb35a17dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432568339146/2969c976-7b59-4702-a357-ca2d31754db9-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Before, life was constant for us, without dangers.

Then the war began. Within eight months everything changed.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Before the war, our life was very good. My father was a carpet-seller, I was studying. Life was constant, without dangers. Then the war began. Within eight months everything changed,” Mohammed says.</p> \n<p>They took their savings and moved to Egypt. Mohammed studied in the morning and took a night job in a restaurant kitchen to help pay the family’s living costs. Life was just about manageable until the youngest boy was diagnosed with leukaemia. Treatment was expensive, so they arranged for their father’s shop in Damascus to be sold, but their money rapidly disappeared into chemotherapy payments. When it became clear that more complex treatment was going to be necessary, a medical charity applied on the family’s behalf for resettlement under the UN scheme. They qualified because of the urgent medical problem; other families qualify if they are deemed particularly vulnerable after being subjected to torture or sexual violence.</p> \n<p>Mohammed (who asked for his surname to be witheld) was sceptical that they would be able to leave; he remembers that, at that time, every refugee he met was full of similar hopes, which usually proved unrealistic. But, a few weeks later, they were interviewed in Cairo, told to get medical checks and finally informed they would be going to the UK. “When they told me: ‘You will travel to the UK,’ I was very surprised. I asked: ‘UK? The UK?’ I was very happy.”</p> \n<p>The family didn’t have to pay for their visas, and plane tickets were provided. They then flew to Manchester, before officials from a housing association brought them to a house in Bradford. They were allocated a support worker who helped the children find school and college places, and who explained the benefit system.</p> \n<p>Mohammed misses his home in Syria. “I have many memories: studying at my desk, watching films, evenings with my family, the tea we drank. Leaving my country ... it is a bad feeling when it is not a choice.”</p> \n<p>On the whole, he likes Bradford and is delighted at how things have turned out. But he knows other families who fled here, forced through the unofficial route because of the limited resettlement scheme. “I have a friend in Wakefield who travelled from Libya to Italy by boat a year ago. He arrived, but his sister died on the journey; she was left in the sea. I think it cost him about $1,200 to $1,500 to make that crossing. The boats are cheap and small and not safe. The person who manages the refugees puts about 1,000 people in the boat, when they are built for 200. For this reason, many are dead in the sea.</p> \n<p>“The governments in Europe should help more,” Mohammed says. “If they helped more, then they wouldn’t decide to travel by boat.” The decision to take a boat is not taken lightly, he adds. “When somebody wants to travel in the sea, he has a special reason. There has to be a reason. When all other things are closed, he decides to open this door.”</p> \n<p>Mohammed has become an informal community organiser for around 20 other families in Bradford that have arrived from Syria, 15 of them under the resettlement scheme. He knows people in the UK are confused about the issue of migration – that many don’t understand the difference between economic migrants and refugees – and that there can be hostility. That said, he has had a warm welcome from his new neighbours. “When they find out that I am from Syria, they smile,” he says, though he stresses that most of the refugees he knows are making a huge effort to be accepted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3facde0e0b6f8e46cf6777c302db8416009e900\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432568598639/18efcfce-bb72-40d8-acc6-8fe26e7e3a24-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The news has been littered with reports of illegal migrant ships sinking in the Mediterranean sea.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The news has been littered with reports of illegal migrant ships sinking in the Mediterranean sea.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA/ALESSANDRO DI MEO</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“These families who live in Bradford, they are working. They are not staying at home, they are not taking money from child benefit and jobseekers’ allowance – they’ve found work as butchers, taxi drivers, or in restaurants,” he says. It is harder for those who come independently and claim asylum once they have arrived, because they have to wait until their application is approved before they can work – a very unsettling period, made harder to cope with by enforced unemployment.</p> \n<p>Mohammed has made progress with his English, and is studying for his A-levels. He plans to apply to medical school. “I hope to be a doctor. When I am a doctor, I will help this country. Many of my Syrian friends, they are working hard – in business, engineering, pharmaceuticals – they want to work. We will be good people in this country; we won’t be drug dealers. We will build the country.”</p> \n<p>Getting used to England can be hard for refugees, but Mohammed and his family have adopted strict techniques for improving their English. “My mother didn’t know any words in English – apart from ‘car’, ‘cat’, ‘house’, that kind of thing. At first, we didn’t speak any Arabic in the house, we spoke only English. If I want water, I say: ‘Excuse me, could I have a cup of water?’ If I’m thinking about going out, I say to my brothers: ‘What is your opinion to make a trip to the park?’</p> \n<p>“They say: ‘Yes, we are happy with that.’”</p> \n<p>He found the Yorkshire accent difficult to start with: “Everyone in Bradford speaks in their own special accent. I say: ‘Can you repeat? Can you repeat again?’ My rule is that I shouldn’t be shy.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.unhcr.org.uk/\">The UN High Commissioner for Refugees</a> has called on governments to offer 100,000 resettlement places for Syria’s refugees in 2015/16. Canada has promised it will accommodate 10,000, and the US has committed to resettling several thousand.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.refugeecouncil.org.uk/\">Refugee Council chief executive</a> Maurice Wren has criticised the UK government’s approach, commenting: “The commitment to the relief effort has been laudable, but it’s not enough. The question is, does David Cameron want to go down in history as the prime minister who rationed his compassion to a few hundred people when there was the opportunity to offer safety to so many more?”</p> \n<p>The government’s position is that it has focused resources on the humanitarian crisis in the region, rather than on resettlement. “The UK has been at the forefront of the international response to the crisis in Syria. We have pledged &pound;800m, making us the second-largest bilateral donor in the world, and our support has reached hundreds of thousands of people,” a Home Office spokesperson said. “The UK has a proud history of offering asylum to those who need it most – there is no quota for any nation and all applications are considered on their individual needs.” Under the VPR scheme, the government expects to resettle “several hundred people over three years”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5145ede9800b3b3bdb492cedeceb7f49c234889\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432574349567/e6587514-e76f-41cc-9c2d-1e6d2cadab12-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Refugee camps provide shelter to the thousands who have been displaced during the conflict.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Refugee camps provide shelter to the thousands who have been displaced during the conflict.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khalil Ashawi/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For the past year, the <a href=\"http://www.citizensuk.org/uk_rr\">campaign group Citizens UK</a> has been targeting councils across the UK, trying to persuade them to accept more Syrian refugees on a local level. The organisation wants each council to commit to resettling 50 refugees, convinced that getting local-authority support is more effective than getting political backing. They have had some success in recent months, with Glasgow agreeing to house another 100 Syrian refugees.</p> \n<p>Rabbi Danny Rich, a community leader for Citizens UK, said: “As a country, we have a tremendous record of giving aid, but it is clear that the most vulnerable need to be resettled. The UK has accepted a pitiful number of UN refugees.</p> \n<p>“[Our suggestion] isn’t an open-door immigration policy, but it is about reviving the proud British tradition of offering shelter and hope to those who are in dire need. We should look back to acts like the <a href=\"http://hmd.org.uk/genocides/kindertransport-refugees\">Kindertransport programme</a> to give politicians the courage and support to do more now.”</p> \n<h2><strong>‘I didn’t give names because, if I had, people would die’ </strong><br /></h2> \n<p>In Coventry, 32-year-old Nor also expresses gratitude to the officials who took her from a refugee camp in Lebanon. Last July, they helped her travel to safety in the UK with her two teenage daughters and her 11-year-old son.</p> \n<p>A designer with her own lingerie shop in Homs, Nor saw her life become complicated in 2011 when peaceful demonstrations against the president were repressed by the ruling party. Nor – who also asked for her real name not to be published, to protect relatives still in Syria – became involved after an unarmed demonstration near her shop was dispersed by government forces who shot and killed dozens of protestors.</p> \n<p>“I was working at my shop when about 35 people came in wounded, among them children and women. It was a very painful day. I had a first-aid kit so I tried to help using that until the ambulance arrived,” she remembers, speaking through an interpreter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b57ccba557e6232294c41dcf2872b28adc8111a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432570039082/64b3eba7-409b-4481-84b9-f5a8f8dd28e2-460x387.jpeg\" alt=\"For six weeks, Nor was kept underground and tortured: 'I was electrocuted, hung upside down and beaten with a cable.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"387\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For six weeks, Nor was kept underground and tortured: ‘I was electrocuted, hung upside down and beaten with a cable.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We were trapped inside for five hours. Tanks were outside. I couldn’t get back to my family. If the government had found out I helped wounded people, I would have been in big trouble, but I was just concerned about helping those who had been hurt. In the evening, my business partner contacted some doctors, and they came and let the injured people out, without anyone seeing. Ever since that day, I felt I had to do more to help people injured in the demonstrations.” Her husband was opposed to her actions, and their marriage broke down.</p> \n<p>When the violence increased in Homs, Nor moved to Damascus and tried to get a passport to leave for Egypt with her children. But, because her name was on a list of anti-government activists, she was stopped at a checkpoint and arrested several times. After her third arrest, she was held for six months. For six weeks, she was kept underground and tortured.</p> \n<p>“I was electrocuted, hung upside down and beaten with a cable. There was psychological torture and abuse. They wanted the names of the people we were working with in Homs to help trapped neighbourhoods,” she says. She reaches into a Moses basket to pick up her six-month-old daughter, the child of a man she met during her time in a refugee camp, in Lebanon. The baby plays with a plastic giraffe and laughs.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t give names because, if I had, people would die.” When she was released, she was smuggled to Lebanon to rejoin her children, who had fled there while she was in prison. After a month, she was advised by friends to apply to the UN’s resettlement programme; she had to provide proof that she had been tortured – she still had the scars. Last June, she was issued with a UK visa.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t until I arrived in the UK that I felt safe. Ten days after I arrived, I was issued with a residency permit for five years. That was the best moment. I know I am secure now – me and my children are safe. They missed three years at school, but they are back now, and they are learning. In the beginning it was very difficult, but they are smart – they have integrated.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dbc5ceb7cec2a93e8f6afb4af1ef14490be85311\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432574456057/141994ee-cce7-4cd3-a298-f6d3a68118ae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Among those displaced, 1.6 million children have fled Syria.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Among those displaced, 1.6 million children have fled Syria.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images/JOSEPH EID</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nor was initially confused by the self-service tills in supermarkets, the unfamiliar scenery and the weather, but she has been reassured by the welcome she has received from neighbours. “I haven’t witnessed any racism; not on the bus, not in the supermarket. I live in a mainly white area – neighbours visit, they are friendly, but there is a language barrier. They know I am Syrian and they are very compassionate.”</p> \n<p>While she talks, a council official arrives to ask if a problem with mould in the kitchen has been sorted (it has). Nor wants to return to work at some point, and would like to run her own business again but, for the moment, she is focused on improving her English and supporting her children.</p> \n<p>She, too, tempers her feelings of relief with concern for those unable to flee. “There are hundreds of people in the camps who have been wounded, or raped, or tortured, who need to be taken care of. The situation is so bad that people are risking their lives, drowning trying to get to Europe. This is only because the EU countries are reluctant to do more. Germany is doing better – people tell me support there is very good. I am shocked that the UK didn’t take more people like me.”</p> \n<p>She knows people who have bought fake passports and come illegally on boats, and she finds it painful to watch news reports about people stuck on the sea. “The whole journey would cost about $10,000. It’s very dangerous. It’s very costly, and it’s not guaranteed. I always think I might have been one of those people. If I hadn’t been give this chance, I might have resorted to that.”</p>","section":"Global","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432567885591/Nor-Syrian-refugee0-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nor (pictured with her baby daughter) is one of only 187 refugees who have been accepted into the UK through an official resettlement programme.

Soon it is / an avenue / which cambers arrogantly past the Mechanics’ Institute …” Armitage’s reading voice is light; not exactly monotonal, but strung on a more delicate, questioning skein than his conversational voice. The poem, Zoom!, the title piece in his very first collection, in 1989, turns left at the main road, leads to a town, “city, nation, hemisphere, universe, … [is] bulleted into a neighbouring galaxy”, before finally coming to rest in the checkout queue at the local supermarket.</p> \n<p>How did the poem come about, Bragg asked. Daydreaming, answered Armitage: “I’d been bunking off school – which was a bit of a worthless pastime in those days because it was before daytime TV.” The audience laughed. He spoke of the challenge, these days, of building thinking time into a day. “‘What have you been doing?’ ‘Thinking’” – another murmur of laughter – “It sounds like an excuse, but actually, it’s vital.” It was a deft, confident performance, an unstrained mixture of taking himself and his work seriously while making sure to puncture anything that might come across as pretension; playing with anti-intellectualism while depending on the fact that no one would be here if they were not intellectually engaged. Did he plan his poems? “I know other poets who work on poems as exploration, but I’ve usually got a destination in mind. I knew in that poem I wanted to end up in Sainsbury’s supermarket” – a slight pause, as the audience guffawed – “it was just a question of getting back from the outer periphery of the universe.”</p> \n<p>The laughter was prolonged, and it came from a core of true respect: Armitage is not only a gifted performer, he is also spoken of as the next poet laureate and the most popular British poet since Philip Larkin; this month he threw his hat into the ring as a candidate to become Oxford professor of poetry (sole requirement: “that candidates be of sufficient distinction to be able to fulfil the duties of the post”). Most of all, from the beginning of his career, Armitage has been a leading example of how a poet might impose him or herself on a culture that is increasingly disinclined to reward poetry – and earn a living from doing so.</p> \n<p>For while poetry might sometimes seem to be everywhere – on underground trains, buildings, Facebook, at spoken-word events; as a piece in Newsweek noted last year, “everything from Chester Zoo to the Great North Run” seems to have its poet-in-residence – this doesn’t tend to translate into actual financial viability. Most first-time collections sell a few hundred copies if their authors are lucky; according to Nielsen BookScan, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jan/02/fire-songs-david-harsent-review\">Fire Songs</a> by David Harsent, which won the 2014 TS Eliot prize – the preeminent prize for poetry in the UK – has so far sold 151 copies. For most poets, self-promotion and performance these days are imperative in order to gain any readership at all, and Armitage – arguably the consummate poet-professional – has come round to making a virtue of that, even a kind of manifesto: “I used to have a purist view of poetry, that the page was all there was,” he said at the Oxford Union in May. “I don’t think that any more. A poet is the entire package. Poetry goes back to the campfire, the theatre, and the temple.”</p> \n<p>So, in one typical two-week period last September, Armitage did the following, and more: worked on a dramatised version of the Raft of the Medusa for Radio 4 (broadcast in April and now in development at the National Theatre); worked on a translation of the medieval poem Pearl (now finished); went to an exhibition by someone who is painting his portrait; met musicians with whom he may collaborate on a spoken-word project; appeared on Radio 3; led a poetry writing workshop at the Wakefield literary festival; had meetings at the Liverpool Everyman theatre to discuss a dramatisation of The Odyssey (it will transfer to Shakespeare’s Globe in London in November); did interviews about a film he had made for the Culture Show; met his new students (he is professor of creative writing at Sheffield); wrote notes for one poem, began another, finished yet another; and did a reading, with the poet Jamie McKendrick, in Modena, Italy. Poetry has taken him to the Amazon and to Iceland, to the US and to New Zealand, on to helicopters, trawlers, trains; to prisons and to residencies at Eton, to conference halls filled with up to 2,500 GCSE students (his poems are on the syllabus). Armitage now has an agent who manages the performing side of his life; he estimates he says yes to about 50% of requests.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Poetry has taken Armitage to the Amazon and Iceland, to the US and New Zealand, to prisons and to Eton</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Over nine months, I accompanied him to some of these events, and began to see exactly how such a significant presence has to be shaped and managed – and to realise that, in this regard, Armitage has a mastery developed over decades of give and take between what has been demanded of him and what he chooses to offer. In West Yorkshire, where he grew up, I did not suggest an itinerary – he did. When we climbed to the top of Pule Hill, I knew he had been there with journalists before, also tracing the lineaments of his poems and life: “We are making a film,” he wrote in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2008/apr/13/biography.simonarmitage\">Gig, his engaging memoir</a> of a lifelong relationship with popular music, about taking a BBC camera crew up there. “Each region has been asked to profile one of its artists. I am THE NORTH.” Production HQ for the film, he wrote, was his parents’ house; they re-enacted one of his poems, setting a tyre in freefall down the hill. His description of the process was as gentle and blokey, self-mocking and sincere as he often is in person.</p> \n<p>But it also smuggled in a very controlled picture of how he wants to be seen. “I am THE NORTH” laughs at the reductiveness of the media – but does not deny it, in part because it is true; he is from the north and proud to be so. Indeed, being “the north” is an aspect of an artistic modus operandi that has over the years proved quite useful – as differentiation from other poets, as a grounding, authenticating narrative of class and language. During our walks, and before and after various events to which I accompanied him, Armitage almost always gave generous and direct answers to my many questions. But I was also – unintentionally, I think – given a masterclass in brand management, all the more skilful because, while not necessarily always reflective of the distance he has travelled from his roots, it does not feel fake. Nor does it obscure Armitage’s unapologetic belief in the importance of poetry, his willingness to advocate for it, and his adamantine sense of vocation.</p> \n<p>Along the way, I met many critics who thought none of this could replace high seriousness: popularity (in a post-Pound, post-Eliot era full of prickly moralising about the virtues of being ignored) was simply assumed to be incommensurate with quality or greatness. There was an overriding sense, as Ian Gregson, a poet and author of a book-length study of Armitage put it, that “I can understand it, so it must be crap”. Back on stage in London, Bragg took the issue head on. Was Armitage aware of the criticism? “I became more and more aware as people pointed it out to me in reviews.” A general laugh. “I suppose what I’ve come to think is, it’s fine. It’s a broad church. I’ve got a lot of respect for people who write obscure avant-garde poetry, but it’s not the poetry I want to write.”</p> \n<p>“He’s not at all simplistic,” said Gregson. “He’s actually trying – and this to me is the ideal – to take on the most difficult, complex things possible but to deal with them as accessibly as he can.” The poet Glyn Maxwell, who travelled with Armitage through Iceland, retracing the route taken by WH Auden in 1936 for their book <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v19/n06/ian-sansom/all-the-cultural-bases\">Moon Country</a> (1996), put the criticism down to simple envy. “It’s the cheapest way to treat someone who’s flown quite high.”</p> \n<p>So high, in fact, that when I asked if he could actually make a living from poetry, Armitage answered, “everything I do stems from the fact that I am a poet. But if I sheared away the prose and teaching and drama? Yeah, I would still get by.” According to figures published late last year by the magazine Mslexia, Simon Armitage was the tenth best-selling poet in the UK in 2013. Those 10 poets, however, included Dante, Homer, Seamus Heaney and Philip Larkin; among living poets, Armitage came third, behind the current poet laureate, Carol Ann Duffy, and Pam Ayres.</p> \n<p><strong>* * *</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b17b87f3412b0c66b10cc6a87b64eba27d0df051\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432554841959/f29f43db-280f-4c86-b8f3-c39614101ba5-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"The poetry seat and the Snow Stone.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Part of the 47-mile Stanza Stone trail in the south Pennines, which features poems by Simon Armitage carved into the rock by Pip Hall.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>A week before the east London gig</strong>, we had met at Marsden station, a small stop on a branch line tucked into the foothills of the Pennines, and drove through the village and out, round bend after bend, via Slaithwaite and Greetland, up to the top of the Pennine watershed. Armitage parked the car, and we stepped into a day of muted silvers: Blackstone Edge reservoir, pylons, a whited-out sky. Armitage, a tall man, walks as he speaks – unhurried, purposeful, with an unselfconscious physical confidence undented (or maybe underscored) by a period in his 20s when, diagnosed with an arthritic condition called ankylosing spondilitis, he thought he might soon not be able to walk at all. But it went into recession and these days he can walk for miles. In 2012, he published Writing Home, an account of an attempt to walk the Pennine Way backwards, from Kirk Yetholm to Marsden, where he was born, paying his way by reading poetry every night; Walking Away, in which he does the same, but from Minehead in Somerset to Land’s End, will be published on 4 June. It is the fourth, and, he says, the last in a series of wry memoirs (the others are Gig and <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201703.All_Points_North\">All Points North</a>) that achieve a distillation of what he ventures in his between‑poem patter at readings: open-seeming self-revelation, meditations on music and landscape and writing, about the meaning of various kinds of home.</p> \n<p>In Gig, he described the tightrope walked by the touring poet: “A single human voice speaking a considered thought can feel like the high point of human achievement, or ... an object lesson in embarrassment.” Fame and achievement alter the balance, but not entirely; every move towards the mic still holds – as it should – an element of risk. “We’re all doing that, aren’t we?” Armitage said. “Every poet who ever stepped on to a stage or made some mark on a piece of paper is testing their reputation in some way. I have got to a point in my life and my career where I’ve stopped having to feel apologetic about what I do and why I do it. And actually I hear those noises coming from a lot of younger writers now. They don’t want to apologise. They want to get it out there and they want to be recognised and they want [poetry] to have a place in people’s lives and on their bookshelves and in their ears.”</p> \n<p>From up here, on a good day, it is possible to see the Welsh mountains and Jodrell Bank telescope; Bolton and the beginnings of the Lake District; Littleborough, and Rochdale, where Armitage once worked as a probation officer. It would be glib to say this period is the reason for the undertow of darkness in his work, but it must have made its mark. Accidental death, affectless murder, suicide and loss stalk his early poems. He is drawn, in an increasingly prominent sideline of reimagined Greek dramas and medieval translations, to stories that face male violence head on. So Mister Heracles (After Euripides) features a viscerally detailed account of Heracles killing his family for the supposed greater good of the “mother state”; in Homer’s Odyssey, Armitage lingers over Cyclops’s bursting eyeball; <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2014/may/14/the-last-days-of-troy-simon-armitage-review\">The Last Days of Troy</a> (produced at the Globe with supermodel Lily Cole as Helen last June) ends in an orgy of violence all the more shocking because it is so deliberately emptied of heroic justification. Armitage left the probation service after he had published four poetry collections and began to think he just might be able to make it as a poet. A surprisingly enlightened Home Office kept his job open for a year in case he foundered and wanted to come back. He never needed to, doing immediately as well, and better, than most poets could dream of – but the freelancer’s fear is not easily shaken. “I’ve only just got used to saying ‘No’,” said Armitage, “and I still don’t say it with much confidence. I don’t think people believe me, anyway.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I have got to a point in my life career where I’ve stopped having to feel apologetic about what I do and why I do it</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Simon Armitage</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Last autumn, Faber published Paper Aeroplane: Selected Poems 1989-2014, a record of a 25-year career as a poet. “Normally when books come out I hardly take any notice of them,” he said. “I flick through to make sure they haven’t been printed upside down. But I always feel I want to move on or I have moved on and that’s been an issue for me – I haven’t really had time to enjoy a lot of things I’ve done.” But when this relatively slim volume arrived, he sat down with it on the end of the bed and stared at it for half an hour, reflecting, he said, on how the early poems in particular seemed “vivid and young, free and easygoing. Most of those original poems were written out of a desire to write rather than any notion they’d find their way into a book. I don’t think you can ever get that back.” They reminded him of an early life – as probation officer, as a homesick Portsmouth geography student who fled back to Marsden as soon as he was able – “that seems unrecognisable to me now”. As for the whole thing: “I think I felt pride, I don’t know if you are allowed to feel those things any more about your own work, but I did, I felt it was an accomplishment. So, yeah, I had a little moment” – he gave the phrase a camp, self-deflating turn, then laughed slightly. “But I’ve moved on now.”</p> \n<p>Up ahead, on a bend in the path, our destination appeared – an outcrop of Yorkshire gritstone so exposed to wind and rain whipping in off the Irish Sea that it has been chiselled into receding striations. At the base there is a flat section, with his rust-red words cut directly into the rock: “Be glad of these freshwater tears / each pearled droplet some salty old sea-bullet / air-lifted out of the waves.” The underlying colour of the rock was a surprise. “The first day I came up here after they carved it,” said Armitage, “it was really pissing it down. It was still quite raw, and it looked as if it was dripping fire.” There are six of these Stanza Stones along 40-odd miles of the Pennine way, commissioned by the Ilkley literature festival as part of the Cultural Olympiad in 2012: an Armitage poem about manifestations of water (Snow, Rain, Mist, Dew, Puddle, Beck) is carved into each one. This stone, Rain, is the only one it is possible to happen upon accidentally; the presence of the poet is an occasional bonus. Two cyclists approached, swept past. “There you go. Oblivious. I think they actually accelerated.” Then a scraggle of chattering ramblers. We both waited – he, it seemed to me (although I could have been wrong) nonchalantly pretending he wasn’t – for at least one of them to stop, to recognise him, even. A couple glanced over, but they all kept walking. A short silence. “I’m sure they know it word for word.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"d27c8e4e67f97e6d08830e94e736bfe4fedd45d0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432554276833/548ff198-7b85-454c-b979-f783631851f3-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"The Rain Stone at Cow's Mouth Quarry\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Rain Stone at Cow’s Mouth Quarry on the Pennine Way.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The second stone he took me to was quite different. Armitage parked along an exposed section of the A62 and we struck immediately, steeply upwards, on to the lower slopes of Pule Hill and a grassy track that led to an abandoned quarry. Many of the rocks here are shaped by man rather than the elements, into flat, near-black expanses, and, when we turned a corner at the top, into standing stones. It’s a chill place, a reminder of an old England of magic and tribal rites, the England Armitage accesses in poems such as Five Eleven Ninety Nine, where a present-day group of men feed and feed and feed a night-time bonfire until there is almost nothing left in the village. “It does feel like there is something malevolent and almost occult about it,” said Armitage, who used to come up here as a boy, even though it terrified him. His poem Snow is tucked into a crevice, lichen already reclaiming the letters.</p> \n<p>Far below us the traffic roared; beyond the road the moors climbed into the sky. In All Points North, Armitage is clear about the importance of this landscape to his imagination. “I think I was aware you always had a choice,” he said. “You can get in the car and turn left into Huddersfield or Leeds or Sheffield, but you can turn the other way and you are not going to meet anybody all day and you can invent what those places mean. They are a kind of canvas or a blank page. Space beyond space and space after that as well, right up to the Cheviots and through Scotland.” All Points North was also his attempt to characterise – rather than define – the north, “where England tucks its shirt into its underpants”. When Armitage published it, in 1998, “there was a new confidence. A real sea change that had taken [the north] from the Roy Hattersley flat cap and whippets version to whatever it was I was describing, which is normality for me.” By the time he wrote Walking Home, 14 years later, it was “the height of the recession and so that was against the backdrop of communities really struggling to keep it together”. Perhaps the only constant, he said, is the growing economic gap between there and London.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c845e2337a7aceb1d16b77d08f3cc249625db350\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432577101056/18907c89-f140-416d-841b-b7a506201404-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Snow Stone\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Snow Stone is tucked into a crevice, lichen already reclaiming the letters.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>And, for him, the cultural backdrop. In Gig he describes standing on West Nab, a point on the Pennine watershed six miles from Pule Hill, and looking out “across a huge circumference of inspiration and influence. Starting westwards it’s Manchester and Lancashire, so it’s Joy Division and the Fall, it’s the Smiths and Elbow, it’s Magazine and the Buzzcocks and Happy Mondays … Sheffield, which for me will always be the Comsat Angels, and maybe Pulp ... the Yorkshire Sculpture Park, which is Barbara Hepworth as a young girl in Wakefield, watching the dark horizon from her father’s car. Keep revolving further and it’s Larkin and Marvell, then Ayckbourn … Leeds is Bennett and Harrison and Henry Moore – and Bradford is Hockney and Priestley … further still there’s a line of wind turbines on the escarpment above Haworth, which is Bront&euml; country. And a few more degrees brings Mytholmroyd and Hebden Bridge and Heptonstall … which is Hughes” – whose work, encountered at school, “lit me up” and made him a poet – “And which is Plath. Then I’m back where I started from, full circle, looking north. Wordsworth, maybe, on a clear day, if the eyes could see that far.”</p> \n<p>* * *</p> \n<h2><br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Armitage did not want to be interviewed</strong> at his own house, apparently because a journalist warned him against allowing this particular intimacy years ago. The stricture didn’t apply to his parents’ house, however, and so we climbed down the hill and drove round to theirs (that “end of terrace” in Zoom!), for a cup of tea. Rather in the way that Armitage’s tight local focus has delivered an international audience, so the house he grew up in, tiny in front, tiny inside, opened on to a tiny patio with a vast view. Below us the land dropped away, into Marsden – terraced cottages, relics of the wool and textile industry, all loured over by a huge derelict mill – and then climbed up again, back into the moors. His tiny bedroom, on the first floor, had a window that looked out on all this. “That window,” he wrote recently in Poetry Review, “became the template for all my future poetry, an almost literal frame, which mimicked the shape of the page and provided a perspective through which I continue to see not just the village but life and the world.”</p> \n<p>Armitage’s father is “a born exaggerator”, a barbershop singer and amateur actor once described by his son as “leaning forward into the applause as if it were sunlight on his face”. He was already a probation officer when Armitage went into the trade, and reportedly rather put out when his son retired before he did. Armitage gets a fair amount of prose mileage out of his father’s witty reactions – to the first appearance of the earring he still wears, to the announcement that he was a poet – but the knockabout is moderated by obvious care and respect, and as we settled on to the patio, in bright sunshine, Armitage leaned back and simply let his father perform. When he did speak, it was as his father does, in a Yorkshire accent far broader than is evident the rest of the time.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Armitage’s father is 'a born exaggerator', a barbershop singer and amateur actor</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Dialect and deliberately northern inflections are central to both the music and the politics of Armitage’s poetry. “Poems are all about signalling,” he often says in question and answer sessions after readings. “We live in a world where as soon as you open your mouth you are pretty much nailed. [People] know you not just horizontally and cartographically, they know you vertically as well, where you stand in the class structure, what your parents did, where you went to school. And I think writers are very aware of that and play with it” – as he does, by sticking the word “mush”, meaning face, into a formal sonnet, for instance. One of the many reasons he chose to translate the medieval poem Gawain and the Green Knight (2007) was that the anonymous poet obviously came from the same part of the world, and Armitage felt an affinity with the words he used, the landscape and rhythms. The translation did well, selling 35,000 copies so far, despite earning Armitage a rap on the knuckles from the eminent critic Frank Kermode, for the “naughtiness” of his frequent modernisms and anachronisms (“I kid you not”; “bum-fluffed bairns”) and occasional ad-libbing.</p> \n<p>His mother arrived, and stood looking over the scene. Both parents are 80 now, and while his father claims to be perfectly happy where he is, his mother obviously has a hankering to travel – “Lake Como,” she said, pointedly, looking at her extremely well-travelled son. When Armitage did his walk down the Pennine Way, he was psychologically hampered, as one critic put it, by the fact that she had done it before him, at about 50. His mother worked as a non-teaching assistant at a couple of infant schools; his father, trained as a plumber, worked as a tyre salesman and, as his son once said, as “a bit of a free agent and wheeler-dealer” before fetching up in the probation service. Often there wasn’t much money; sometimes, Armitage suspects, none at all, though “I don’t remember that anxiety being passed on to us.”</p> \n<p>“I remember when something new came into the house,” he had said to me earlier that morning. “It was astonishing. Like a vase. Or god forbid a settee. We’d sort of stand round it and gawp at it.” In Armitage’s poetry, objects are described with surprising exactness, partly for their own sake, partly for their roles in (often male) ceremonies and processes – and partly as instant metaphors. “Most objects speak volumes about their social value.” In his work the language of objects allows, at its best, complex, unspelled-out layers of social commentary, and shows, at its least, a sophisticated knack for lists.</p> \n<p>John Updike once suggested that he was prolific because he treated writing like a nine-to-five job, rather than a fitful process of waiting for a muse; that he and others like him, such as Joyce Carol Oates, were “blue-collar writers”. Armitage, whose bibliography now includes 21 books of poetry, five of non-fiction, two novels, 21 films, many radio plays, and five works for theatre (not to mention the fact that, with his wife Sue Roberts, he performs in an eight-person band called the Scaremongers), is undeniably prolific, to an extent that seems to provoke suspicion in the literary world: if you produce that much, with such fluidity, it cannot possibly be good. “I definitely don’t think of it as a job,” said Armitage. “I had a job once and I got rid of it. But I completely understand that idea of coming from a working-class background and wanting to get on with something. There is a sort of satisfaction in being self-employed or self-made, homemade.” The Armitage household is one of enthusiasms: music, cricket, astronomy, birdwatching, art, walking, and acting – lots of acting. Armitage Senior’s all-male pantomime (he is writer and director) is so popular that it is always sold out way ahead of Christmas; in Marsden, he is the undisputed star, not his son. Back in his home town, Armitage Junior’s success, anywhere in the world, is still measured in terms of the capacity of the local Parochial hall – “2.5 Parochial halls? Not bad.” Hence, perhaps, his gregariousness, his tendency to hang poems on a story or a fragment of story, his ease with performance: tell a tale, a yarn, grab your audience by the collar and drag them along with you – a disposition that achieves a kind of zenith in the brilliant, moving prose poems of his 2010 book <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2010/may/09/seeing-stars-simon-armitage-review\">Seeing Stars</a>.</p> \n<p>But gregariousness, humour and ease, while alluring, are not the same as emotional availability. An attempt to ask about his first marriage – the subject of unusually personal poems in his fourth collection, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2003/dec/27/featuresreviews.guardianreview11\">The Book of Matches</a> – was swiftly shut down. “You were married before,” I begin. “Was I?” There are distancing devices everywhere in the work: the emphasis on stories and concrete things can push the focus outward rather than inward, and a performer doesn’t have to display feelings he doesn’t choose to. “He’s guarded,” said Maxwell, who has fond memories of often quite silent walks through Iceland. “Everyone should be. His public person is certainly not fake. It’s an authentic public persona. He knows the difference and he guards the border.”</p> \n<p>After we left his parents, Armitage gave me a tour of Marsden: the Parochial, the school, the bust of Samuel Laycock (the village’s other famous poet) overlooking the playground. When we stopped for lunch, sloppy sandwiches on a bench in the main square, family acquaintance after family acquaintance walked past, saying hello. Suddenly it all became too much. “It feels like being in the Truman Show,” said Armitage. “Let’s go.” But not before a middle-aged man came up to him. “Mr Armitage?” Yes. “Great reading you.” Thank you. “Now, I’ve been trying to get tickets to your father’s pantomime …”</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"388c3b4ac4a8f8ed02540f3119aa48c21d21cc25\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432555454771/a49055ca-3204-447f-9a1a-b4920183ae61-460x313.jpeg\" alt=\"Simon Armitage talks about his poetry anthology, Paper Aeroplane, at a London bookshop.\" width=\"460\" height=\"313\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Armitage talks about his latest collection of poetry, Paper Aeroplane, at a London bookshop.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>On stage in London,</strong> Armitage introduced another poem. “I think every poet at some stage in their writing life should try and write the definitive home-town poem. With Huddersfield, that was difficult. I didn’t really know what to lock on to as a coordinate. I eventually felt that the one thing that was most authentic were these synthetic – sort of Tudor – coffeehouses.” Laughter. “They’ve even proliferated into Halifax.” The laughter built. “There’s a drive-in! Ye olde drive-in coffee-house.” The poem is addressed to the “women of the Merrie England Coffee Houses”, in a tone that is insistently physical, both sexual and respectful of them as mothers, from the remembered point of view of a young Armitage and his friend, “the boy Smith”, who spent afternoons in those coffeehouses, grateful to be allowed to eke out “one toasted teacake between us” as they tried to write. “O women of the Merrie England, under those scarlet aprons, are you naked?” “He’s writing about a world he loves,” says Jeremy Noel-Tod, a poet and academic who has followed Armitage’s work for 20 years. And while Armitage is never going to express emotions in a high-blown way, that does not mean they are not there: that gratefulness; the fact – delivered in an aside – that the Boy Smith’s mother fell asleep at the wheel. “There’s a grief that’s not being talked about here – I think that’s really part of the Englishness of his work. He’s very good at talking about how things are not talked about.” It’s a tricky thing to pull off, and while the poem veers close to objectification, it works, in the end. The audience sighed, appreciative.</p> \n<p>When we had finished in Marsden, Armitage drove me into Huddersfield to take the train, and, while we were waiting, to a Merrie England Coffee House (via a building topped by a fibreglass lion about which he has also written a poem) for a cup of tea. I could see how it was, once, how much it meant, the permission given and the start made; but also just how much has changed since. In his statement of candidacy for professor at Oxford, Armitage wrote that he would use the post “to discuss the situation of poetry and poets in the 21st century, to address the obstacles and opportunities brought about by changes in education, changes in reading habits, the internet, poetry’s decreasing ‘market share’, poetry’s relationship with the civilian world and the (alleged) long, lingering death of the book.” When he walked the Pennine Way, doing a gig a night, for Walking Home, he made much of the fact that he was testing the health of poetry in general – was it even alive? Would people come? All it really tested, I suggested, is how well Armitage, specifically, is doing. He bristled. “No, I disagree. In some of those places people didn’t know who I was but they came along to listen to a poetry reading. And anyway, even if they did know it was me, it’s still poetry.” <span class=\"bullet\">•</span></p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Follow the Guardian Long Read on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a></p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432553651240/7d132771-2116-4b5d-a6b8-1be8b9d0b214-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gareth Phillips for the Guardian","altText":"Simon Armitage.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gareth Phillips for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432554840512/f29f43db-280f-4c86-b8f3-c39614101ba5-2060x1373.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1373,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Part of the 47-mile Stanza Stone trail in the south Pennines, which features poems by Simon Armitage carved into the rock by Pip Hall.

No, they say. Nothing simple about it.</p> \n<p>Santamaria and Rosenbaum worked to pursue the answer through a tangle of belief, logic, probability, perception and calculation.

He toiled away at drafting bills for Labour’s first 100 days in power – ready in time for tomorrow’s Queen’s speech. Labour, he told me, would have hit the ground running with an array of measures – an agenda Ed Miliband said would “change the way the country is run and who it’s run for”.</p> \n<p>Here’s an exclusive glimpse of the bills that could have graced the goatskin parchment the Queen will slip out of the silk purse. First, a housing bill would have paved the way for 200,000 new homes a year, with planning reform and powers to stop developers sitting on unused land-banks. Plans to regulate the private rented sector included three-year leases, rents only rising with&nbsp;inflation.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2014/jul/17/bedroom-tax-housing-benefit-reform-explained\" title=\"\">bedroom tax</a> would have been abolished within a week by statutory instrument. A bill would have reformed the energy market, temporarily preventing price rises while the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/feb/18/big-six-energy-firms-overcharging-customers-by-up-to-234-a-year\" title=\"\">six companies were broken up</a>, no longer acting as both retailer and wholesaler – a signal to all sectors where consumers feel trapped by cabals.</p> \n<p>A labour market reform bill would have ended zero-hours contracts and abolished prohibitive fees for employment tribunals. A constitutional convention would have brought devolution for Scotland and Wales going beyond the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/nov/27/scottish-devolution-smith-commission-key-points\" title=\"\">Smith commission</a>, accommodating <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/dec/16/english-votes-english-laws-three-options-william-hague\" title=\"\">English votes for English laws</a> without making Scottish representatives second-class MPs. House of Lords reform would have been prepared, along with votes at 16. We would have been spared the EU&nbsp;referendum.</p> \n<p>A bill would have repealed the marketising elements of the Health and Social Care Act, the notorious <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/apr/22/section-75-health-act-destruction-engine\" title=\"\">section 75</a> that puts every service up for private tender. The NHS would have been restored as preferred provider, with the health secretary again legally responsible for the service. <a href=\"http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/new-nhs/health-and-wellbeing-boards\" title=\"\">Shifting the NHS to local councils’ health and wellbeing boards</a> would have spread the devolution now happening in Manchester to all councils, integrating health and social care. A bill devolving power to city regions and counties would have gone further than George Osborne proposes. New free schools would have been stopped, instead of the 500 more Cameron promises. On railways, a bill would have created a public sector competitor free to bid for all franchises – and the badger cull would have ended.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/law/2015/may/22/falconer-scrap-human-rights-act-thrown-out-house-of-lords-gove\">Attempt to scrap Human Rights Act will not get past Lords, Falconer warns Gove</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One bill Falconer drew up with particular relish: over-mighty media ownership would be curtailed. A bill would have restored something like the rules before Margaret Thatcher abolished limits on the press and broadcasting one owner could control, when she granted Rupert Murdoch unprecedented market dominance. Newspapers would have been pushed to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/media/leveson-inquiry\" title=\"\">fall in with Leveson</a>. Since all titles but the Guardian and Mirror backed David Cameron, Labour had little to lose by restoring more media plurality. Yet it fired new levels of ferocity. Will anyone dare again?</p> \n<p>The first budget would have raised the top tax rate back to 50p, brought in a mansion tax and abolished non-dom status for those long resident, while raising the minimum wage. It would have sealed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/13/labour-manifesto-pledges-to-boost-minimum-wage-and-cut-deficit\" title=\"\">Labour’s eye-wateringly tough pledge to abolish the deficit in one parliament </a>(something Osborne probably won’t). Ed Balls would have made good his promise of no rise in income tax, VAT or national insurance – though they collect &pound;3 out of every &pound;4 in revenue. That budget would have bound Labour to cap the social security bill, painfully hard as tax credits rise due to low pay and housing benefit soars due to sky-rocketing rent. There was nothing flaky in Labour’s fiscal policy: it was too austere for many Keynesians.</p> \n<p>Looking back, Falconer sees those first bills as talismanic of what Miliband’s Labour could have been. He is one of the few close Blair colleagues who worked flat out to get the party elected, while so many of yesterday’s men sniped from the sidelines offering unfriendly advice, instead of shooting at the enemy.</p> \n<p>As Labour strives to recover from a near-death experience, the leadership candidates’ instinct is to shed what they fought the election on. Anything else, some say, is “an ostrich” over the enormity of Labour’s defeat. In truth, many of these were popular policies, well tested with the public. Surely none of the candidates inching for an illusory “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/09/tony-blair-labour-return-centre-ground-general-election-defeat\" title=\"\">centre ground</a>” can make a tougher tax-and-spend, deficit-cutting, welfare-capping offer? Perhaps Labour did talk too much of underdogs on zero hours and not enough about the squeezed middle. But this is no time to stop talking about galloping inequality, just when the governor of the bank of England, the OECD and the World Economic Forum warn it presents the most serious economic risk.</p> \n<p>With Labour and its leader as unpopular as they are, different policies would have changed little. Even a political magician would have struggled against two mighty forces: first, Labour, like every other government ejected after the crash, could never escape blame for both the meltdown and the resulting deficit. The Tories nailed Labour into that coffin. Second came pre-election economic figures beyond Osborne’s wildest hopes: few governments fall when jobs, wages and growth rise while inflation plummets, let alone with a bonus of tumbling petrol prices.</p> \n<p>As the Queen adjusts her glasses tomorrow to read out Cameron’s programme, pause to consider how much better – and more popular – most of Falconer’s bills would have been. Do most people really want to spend the next two years obsessing over Europe and the Human Rights Act? Selling off social housing instead of building it? Clamping down on strikes and cutting public spending and benefits in ways kept hidden before the election?</p> \n<p>Michael Gove as lord chancellor will hand up the speech and not Charlie Falconer, because Labour was roundly rejected. But it would be a mistake for leadership contenders to think victory depends on renouncing Labour’s manifesto. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/15/liz-kendall-labour-must-back-europe-referendum-and-embrace-business\" title=\"\">Liz Kendall ditches the 50p top tax rate</a> and wants a tougher family benefit cap. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/19/labour-business-yvette-cooper-deficit-mansion-tax\" title=\"\">Yvette Cooper goes for cutting corporation tax</a>, while <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/24/guardian-view-on-labour-leadership-race-words-aplenty-arguments-scarce\" title=\"\">Mary Creagh and Andy Burnham ditch the mansion tax</a> as “the politics of envy”.

I was searching for a way to demonstrate 3D movement to my students and one day found myself staring into the River Danube, looking at how the water moved around the pebbles. This became the inspiration for the cube’s twisting mechanism. The fact that it can do this without falling apart is part of its magic.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://brc.lsc.org/invent/\">I experimented in my mother’s flat, using wood, rubber bands and paper clips to make a prototype</a>. I needed some sort of coding to bring sense to the rotations of the cube, so I used the simplest and strongest solution: primary colours. Putting the stickers on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTkhA3RO5fU\">the finished cube</a> felt very emotional. I knew it was revolutionary. The moment I started twisting the sides, I could see it was a proper puzzle – but what I didn’t know was whether it could be solved. It took me weeks: there are 43 quintillion permutations!</p> \n<p>Once I’d cracked it, I knew it could sell. But I took three years to get it to market. First, a firm called Politechnika manufactured it as Buvos Kocka, or <a href=\"https://uk.rubiks.com/about/the-history-of-the-rubiks-cube\">Magic Cube</a>. Then a salesman called Tibor Laczi told me he could get it distributed on the other side of the iron curtain. He has since described me as being “terribly dressed, looking like a beggar, with a cheap Hungarian cigarette hanging out of my mouth”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huh4GEPKYt4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/huh4GEPKYt4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>He told me we could sell millions and took it to the 1979 Nuremberg toy fair where it was seen by Tom Kremer, who was the key to getting global distribution. I’ve always kept my distance from the business side, though. I feel more like a father to a child: my cube inspired thousands of “twisty puzzles” and I’m amazed how it continues to excite new generations. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2999250/Rubik-s-Cube-world-champion-solves-puzzle-15-seconds-SHARK-TANK.html\">People have taken cubes underwater</a> and to outer space. On the 40th anniversary, I was in New York to see the <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/146226319125886306/\">Empire State Building light up in its colours</a>.</p> \n<p>I never imagined it would become a global craze. It became the bestselling toy of all time, with 350m sold. The world record was broken again recently, too. <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2145118/rubiks-cube-world-record-video/\">It now stands at an astonishing 5.25 seconds</a>. Teenagers are fastest. I was 30 when the cube was born, so was never in the same league. My average was always about a minute.</p> \n<p><strong>David Kremer, president, Rubik’s Brand</strong></p> \n<p>Tom Kremer, the early mentor of the cube, is my father so I was one of the first people in the UK to get one. I was doing my A-levels and it proved a fantastic distraction. According to my dad, the cube wasn’t a big sensation at the Nuremberg toy fair: it was just a small thing in a backwater section at this huge event. And his curiosity was only aroused by the fact that he heard the people in charge of the cube speaking Hungarian, a very unusual language. He went over, had a look and got involved.</p> \n<p>He licensed the rights to the Ideal Toy Company and it became the first puzzle ever to be advertised on TV. The company were in the last chance saloon. They had games such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HU5yRMSA5FQ\">KerPlunk</a> but were facing huge debts. Rubik’s Cube saved them for a few years but by 1983, after 300m had been sold, everybody had one. The cube went from world’s greatest fad to zero: there were thousands piled up in warehouses.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTkhA3RO5fU\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jTkhA3RO5fU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In 2013, we acquired the rights and founded <a href=\"http://www.rubiksbrand.com/\">Rubik’s Brand Ltd</a> to battle the many fakes and copyright the trademark. We’re now selling 10m a year. It’s pretty much the one Professor Rubik invented, although we recently brought out a version where the tiles are colour-moulded, not stickered – because cheats peel the stickers off! There’s another called <a href=\"https://uk.rubiks.com/store/cubes/rubiks-void\">The Void</a>, which is like a Rubik’s Cube but with a hole in the middle. It might actually be harder to solve.</p> \n<p>My son can do a Rubik’s Cube in under a minute, but people are generally impressed if you can solve one at all. If I ever take one on to the tube, I find that by the time I’ve done it, the whole carriage is watching.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Professor Erno Rubik’s prototypes form part of the touring exhibition <a href=\"http://brc.lsc.org/tour/\">Beyond Rubik’s Cube</a>, at the Great Lakes Science Center in Cleveland, Ohio, 30 May to 7 September.</p>","section":"Culture","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432572824228/daac479b-1e12-42e1-b6b8-fdfe710e643f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ANL/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Erno Rubik with his daughter Anna in 1981.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: ANL/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-26T05:59:01Z","lastModified":"2015-05-26T05:59:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":16,"contributors":[{"name":"Dave Simpson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/davesimpson"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Toys","Culture","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/toys","webTitle":"Toys"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"culture"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Dave Simpson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/davesimpson"}}],"series":{"title":"How we made","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/series/how-we-made"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"culture"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2015/may/26/erno-rubik-how-we-made-rubiks-cube","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497nh","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/culture/2015/may/26/erno-rubik-how-we-made-rubiks-cube","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/may/26/erno-rubik-how-we-made-rubiks-cube"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432572824228/daac479b-1e12-42e1-b6b8-fdfe710e643f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The first time it took me weeks: there are 43 quintillion permutations!’ … Erno Rubik with his daughter Anna in 1981.
