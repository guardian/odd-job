Were they faking it, or was the mind playing tricks? A neurologist on her most intriguing cases</p>","byline":"Suzanne O'Sullivan","body":"<p>I was a junior doctor when I encountered Yvonne. She was 40 and worked in a supermarket. One Tuesday she was reorganising produce in a refrigerated unit while a colleague cleaned the glass. Yvonne turned to talk to her just as she released a small spray of window cleaner. Yvonne felt the liquid splatter on her face and a burning in both eyes. Another colleague led her to the bathroom and washed her eyes with water. Yvonne was taken by ambulance to hospital, where she was examined and had her eyes bathed. Her husband was called, and by the time he arrived she was feeling better. Her eyes were red and full of tears, but she could see normally and the pain had lessened. Her husband took her home.</p> \n<p>He told her not to go in to work the next day, and during the morning Yvonne noticed her vision blurring. By lunchtime, she was struggling to read the digital clock. Her husband and children came home that evening and encouraged her to have an early night. When Yvonne woke up and opened her eyes, everything was black. She cried out for help and heard the noise of people entering the room, but could not see them. She was completely blind.</p> \n<p>When I met her, six months had passed and, despite several hospital visits and tests, doctors had told Yvonne they could find nothing wrong. As a last resort she was referred to a neurologist.</p> \n<p>At the time, I was a trainee. Since then, I have been a consultant for more than 10 years, first at the <a href=\"http://www.bartshealth.nhs.uk/our-hospitals/the-royal-london-hospital/\">Royal London Hospital</a>, now at the <a href=\"https://www.uclh.nhs.uk/OurServices/OurHospitals/NHNN/Pages/Home.aspx\">National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery</a>.</p> \n<p>I knew from an early stage that I wanted to be a neurologist. I enjoyed the detective drama of the job, unravelling the mysteries of how the nervous system communicates its messages. But I did not predict how far I would be drawn into the care of people whose illness originated not in the body but in the mind. Some examples of how the mind affects the body are commonplace: we are familiar with the shake in our hand as we pick up the pen to sign the marriage register, or the bead of sweat on our brow as we stand up to give a presentation. These are the body’s physiological responses to stress. But we are less familiar with the frequency with which people can unconsciously think themselves ill. Up to one third of people seen in an average general neurology clinic have symptoms that cannot be explained by medical tests or examinations. In those people, an emotional cause is often suspected.</p> \n<p>Yvonne was sitting on the bed, a tiny woman, shoulders hunched, elbows pressed tightly to her sides, fingers intertwined in her lap. She looked so much older than 40. Her blank eyes stared far beyond us. Her husband sat beside the bed, his arms folded over an expansive chest, his eyes vigilant.</p> \n<p>There were nine of us standing by – a mixture of junior doctors, medical students and a nurse – as the consultant began reviewing Yvonne’s story. Her husband made frequent corrections. “No, it wasn’t just window cleaner, it was a bleach-based detergent. Yes, a colleague had tried to rinse her eyes but had wiped them with a wet towel, not used running water.” He said he had contacted the company who made the detergent and they had said it could cause nerve damage if absorbed by the eye. He’d like that documented. I exchanged a small smile with one of the other junior doctors.</p> \n<p>The consultant asked Yvonne if her vision was good enough to distinguish light or dark, or make out shapes. She said she could sometimes tell that a light had been switched on, but that was all. He shone a torch into her eye and asked if she noticed any change. She said she couldn’t be sure.</p> \n<p>At first, as she answered the consultant’s questions, Yvonne appeared to stare to his right, as if she could not tell where he was. But as the conversation developed, her eyes began to dart about, sometimes to his face or to her husband, then flitting back to a point in the middle distance.</p> \n<p>We watched as the consultant worked through his examination. Yvonne’s pupils reacted briskly to light, just as they should. But when he asked her to follow the light with her eyes, she couldn’t do it. He took from his bag a small rotating drum painted in black and white stripes. He held it in front of Yvonne and spun it quickly. Her eyes flickered from side to side in response to it, involuntarily drawn to the spinning stripes.</p> \n<p>As the consultant lifted the ophthalmoscope to Yvonne’s eye for the final time, she blinked. I heard a small thrill of a laugh somewhere in the room. Yvonne must have heard it, too, as she was startled. “Is there someone else here with you?” she asked.</p> \n<p>The giggles were less stifled this time. Out in the corridor, one person whispered a shared thought: “There’ll be no Oscars for that performance.”</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Yvonne was in hospital for a week, waiting for her tests. I spent a little longer with her than the other patients, because I was interested in her. She had grown up in rural Ireland, in a loving but sheltered home. At 20 she had married her first boyfriend, Gerald, who was 10 years older. Within 10 months of the wedding she’d had her first child. By the age of 30 she had six children under 10.</p> \n<p>Yvonne had spent most of her adult life devoted to the care of her family. Her husband worked full-time. “We are a good team,” she said. It was only when the oldest children had left home and the youngest were all in secondary school that she first experienced what it felt like to have time on your hands. Encouraged by her eldest daughter, she decided to take a job in a local supermarket. Gerald had been against the idea, worried she’d have less time for the family. She assured him she would work only in school hours and that they would not even know she had been anywhere else.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I noticed increasingly that when she spoke, she looked me in the eye. It was more than a glance; I felt our eyes connect</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>During Yvonne’s stay in hospital, she came to recognise my voice and step, and greeted me warmly when I called to see her. As the days went by, I noticed increasingly that when she spoke, she looked me in the eye. It was more than just a simple glance; I felt our eyes connect.</p> \n<p>Yvonne stayed in hospital for two weeks. On the day she was to be discharged, Gerald was there as the consultant gave her the results. Each test had been normal. The integrity of her visual pathway was intact, her brain was normal and we could not find any neurological cause for her problem. The only possible explanation left for her loss of sight was functional blindness, caused by stress.</p> \n<p>“My wife hasn’t had a day of stress in her life. You’re talking nonsense,” Gerald replied.</p> \n<p>It was explained again that all the avenues had been explored and there was no other possible explanation. Finally, her husband reluctantly agreed that Yvonne would meet a psychiatrist; if only to prove us wrong, as he put it.</p> \n<p>I returned to the ward with Yvonne’s discharge letter. “I have something for you,” she said, and handed me a card. On the front was a flower-filled field overlooked by a single tree. It was drawn in coloured pencil. The words inside said thank you, it was nice to have somebody to chat to every day.</p> \n<p>“I made the card,” Yvonne said.</p> \n<p>“You made it!” I could not hide my surprise.</p> \n<p>“Yes, I borrowed pencils and paper from the woman in the bed next to me,” Yvonne replied.</p> \n<p>“But if you can’t see, how could you draw?”</p> \n<p>“I can feel the pencil marks on the paper,” she answered. She did not seem in the least affronted.</p> \n<p>Gerald appeared and led her away. I looked at the picture again. All the colours were correct – the tree green, the bark brown. Not a single outline was broken, not a single leaf or flower out of place.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>One of the greatest challenges for most doctors is the struggle to believe in the truly subconscious nature of their patients’ psychosomatic symptoms. <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/300324/Pierre-Janet\">Pierre Janet</a>, a French philosopher and psychologist in the late 19th century, was pivotal in the development of what we call the subconscious. He described consciousness as those sensory experiences and thoughts of which we are actively aware, whereas our subconscious is a place to store information not immediately available to the conscious mind.</p> \n<p>Janet thought our consciousness could expand and contract, and choose what we perceived and what we ignored. There are examples of this in everyday life – looking for a friend in a crowd, for example. They are right in front of you, waving, but somehow you look right past them. “You must have seen me,” they say afterwards. “You looked right at me!” But you didn’t. For a moment, your mind employed selective attention and blocked something from your view.</p> \n<p>Janet said that a separation between the subconscious and conscious could see memories and feelings exist in parallel parts of the mind, neither knowing of the other. This he referred to as dissociation, arguing that a psychological trauma could cause the subconscious to slink away so it was no longer available. In his model, it would be possible for Yvonne both to see and be unaware of seeing at the same time.</p> \n<p>I saw Yvonne just once more, to arrange her psychiatry assessment. What little I would learn later would come in correspondence from the psychiatrist. These letters were factual, plainly written but always slightly cagey, as they have to be. Yvonne’s accident at work had resulted in an argument at home, the first letter said. Gerald had been called away from work to collect her from hospital. When he learned what had happened, he insisted she resign instantly. Yvonne, whose vision was not affected in the incident’s immediate aftermath, tried to plead otherwise, but he called her employer and offered her resignation. Later that evening the argument became moot when Yvonne discovered she had lost her vision.</p> \n<p>The letter stated that Yvonne was struggling at home. Gerald had hired a housekeeper who did all the housework and helped with the children, but would not take responsibility for Yvonne. This left her feeling both superfluous and frightened.</p> \n<p>After meeting the psychiatrist, Yvonne agreed to an admission to the psychiatric ward for intensive rehabilitation and talking therapy.</p> \n<p>The final letter came months later:</p> \n<p><em>I am happy to let you know that Yvonne’s vision has returned to normal. She has engaged well with treatment, although both she and her husband still struggle a little to accept the diagnosis in full. She has recently moved back to the family home and reports that things are going well. So much so that she has decided it would not be right to return to work.</em></p> \n<p>Yvonne has crossed my mind several times since then, and I feel I did her a disservice. I was a fool to question her motives and insight because she had, suspectingly or unsuspectingly, told me exactly how things were when she handed me the card she had made. A woman who wishes to lie and fake wears dark glasses , carries a cane and stumbles about. That woman certainly does not draw a picture. Yvonne’s drawing was evidence not of guilt but of innocence, and, at the moment she handed it to me, it was I who could not see.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Shahina’s illness had begun six months before we met, following an incident at university. She had turned up late to her lecture one day, to find all the outer seats of the long, tiered rows were taken. Rather than pushing past her classmates, Shahina took off her coat and sat on a step behind a row of other latecomers, her hands behind her on the floor for support. For the next five minutes the door of the lecture theatre swung open from time to time as other students ducked in.</p> \n<p>Shahina was leaning to one side, craning to see the lecturer, when she felt a crushing pain. She let out a loud cry and a titter went up from students nearby. The red-faced boy who had stood on her hand muttered an embarrassed apology. A tear fell as she held her hand to her chest. For the rest of the lecture Shahina could not concentrate, as she watched a large, dark bruise develop.</p> \n<p>Shahina’s family had little sympathy for her that evening, when she complained of the pain and refused to help with household chores. They reacted differently when they saw how swollen and bruised her hand was the following morning. Shahina’s mother took her straight to A&amp;E, where it was discovered that she had a hairline fracture of a metacarpal bone. Her hand was splinted and her arm was put in a sling. For three weeks Shahina could not use her right arm. She typed with one hand and used a Dictaphone to record lectures.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"869b11b80ac8d151a05bfdeb65ed83fe80cdd7e6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431513464214/1683fe6f-e278-43ab-81d0-ee74f2784929-329x420.jpeg\" alt=\"All in head 2\" width=\"329\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>When the splint was finally removed, underuse had left Shahina’s hand thin and useless. The doctor arranged for her to meet a physiotherapist, who advised a series of exercises. She was glad to be able to use her hand again.</p> \n<p>About two weeks later, Shahina was sitting in a lecture when she felt a cramp in her hand. Her pen slipped from her fingers and rattled noisily to the floor. She bent to pick it up, but found herself pawing uselessly at the pen as it slid between her fingers and rolled away. When the lecture was over, Shahina showed her friends her hand. The index and middle fingers were bending inwards. She could easily stretch them out flat with her other hand, but as soon as she let go, the fingers curled again, slowly. Her friends laughed when they saw it and for half an hour played the game of curl-and-uncurl with Shahina’s fingers. Shahina also found it funny, but only for a while.</p> \n<p>When we met in the outpatient department one month later, her arm was in a sling and all four fingers were curled inwards, the index and middle ones completely folded, their nails hidden from view. When I tried to straighten them, there was resistance. It was painful but possible to draw the fingers outwards, so that the palm of the hand was bared. Four red welts were visible where the nails had burrowed into the skin. When I released the fingers, they sprang back into their coiled position.</p> \n<p>“Have you ever seen anything like that? Do you know what it is?” her mother asked.</p> \n<p>“It looks as if Shahina has developed <a href=\"http://www.dystonia.org.uk/index.php/professional-research/types-of-dystonia/focal-hand-dystonia\">focal dystonia</a>,” I said. “It’s a condition in which people’s muscles go into spasm. It can be triggered by trauma, but we need to look for other causes.”</p> \n<p>When Shahina and I met again, she had been admitted as an inpatient on the ward. Her hand was just as it had been when I saw her last. Blood tests, genetic tests and brain scans designed to look for an underlying neurological disease were all normal. But Shahina’s dominant hand was useless to her now, and she needed her mother to do up her buttons and cut her food.</p> \n<p>A specialist neurologist recommended that she be given a therapeutic trial of botulinum toxin. Botox isn’t just for cosmetic use: it has long been used as a treatment for neurological disorders. In people whose muscles go into painful spasm, for whatever reason, it can paralyse the muscles so they relax. The paralysed muscle may then prove useless, but if it results in an improvement in pain and deformity, it can be worth it anyway.</p> \n<p>I accompanied Shahina to have the procedure. A small needle electrode was placed in the muscles of her forearm. The electrode recorded the excess electrical activity that was produced by the furiously over-contracting muscles leading to her fingers. The computer converted the electrical activity to a noise, so that when the needle was inserted into Shahina’s arm, the room filled with a wild crackling sound. The doctor running the test leaned over and turned down the volume.</p> \n<p>“Is that my arm making that noise?” Shahina asked.</p> \n<p>“Yes.”</p> \n<p>“Is that what it is supposed to sound like?”</p> \n<p>“Not if you are trying to relax. If the muscles going to your fingers were able to relax, there would be silence.”</p> \n<p>The doctor took a small syringe filled with botulinum toxin, attached it to the needle, and slowly injected. Shahina watched the computer screen. We were all listening. The static crackling that had been present since the electrode had been inserted was dying down. Shahina’s gaze moved from the screen to her hand. Her eyes were transfixed as her fingers slowly unfurled.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Do you really think my daughter could hold her hand like this for weeks? She's in pain. I know my own child</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“It worked!” she cried.</p> \n<p>The doctor who had given the injection looked at me with raised eyebrows.</p> \n<p>That afternoon I went to the ward to see if Shahina’s improvement was sustained. I found her tapping away at the keyboard of her computer.</p> \n<p>“It hurts and my hand feels a bit weak, but look how good it is.” She opened and closed her fist. “I’m cured, can I go home now?”</p> \n<p>What I did next I would regret many times.</p> \n<p>“I need to explain something to you, Shahina.” I sat beside her on the bed as I spoke. “Botulinum toxin poisons the nerve ending and the result is that it relaxes the muscles. But it doesn’t usually work instantaneously. It takes a day or two.”</p> \n<p>Shahina looked at me, puzzled. She had not understood the full implications of what I’d said.</p> \n<p>“But it worked straight away for me. That’s a good sign, right?”</p> \n<p>“Yes, which is all that really matters.”</p> \n<p>“OK, so I can go home.”</p> \n<p>Shahina had offered me an opportunity to retreat and I ignored it.</p> \n<p>“What I’m trying to say is that I don’t think it could have been the botulinum toxin that made you better. The recovery was too quick.”</p> \n<p>Shahina was staring at her hand, watching her fist opening and closing in front of her.</p> \n<p>“You think I’m mad?”</p> \n<p>“Of course not.”</p> \n<p>The mood in the room had turned. People passing heard the raised voice and looked in.</p> \n<p>“I can’t fucking believe it! I came to this hospital with muscle spasm in my hand and now I’m being told I’m doing it on purpose.”</p> \n<p>The next 10 minutes were delicate. I explained psychosomatic symptoms to her.</p> \n<p>“Where does that leave me? Will my hand stay better? Will I need botulinum toxin again?”</p> \n<p>“I think that since your hand is better now, it will probably stay better.” I was offering hope because expectations matter.</p> \n<p>“I’m sorry I shouted.”</p> \n<p>“I’m sorry you’ve had such a hard time.”</p> \n<p>I left, understanding that Shahina would go home and we’d meet again in the clinic in the future. An hour later I was called back to the ward.</p> \n<p>Shahina’s mother stood squarely in the door.</p> \n<p>“My daughter has told me you said she was doing this deliberately. Do you really think a young girl could hold her hand in that position for weeks? There are welts on her hand. She’s in pain.”</p> \n<p>“Shahina’s spasms of her hand are involuntary and very disabling, we all agree on that.”</p> \n<p>“I know my own child. She is a bright girl, halfway to being a lawyer. She works hard, she is never ill. I guarantee you that if she had any control over this, it would not be happening.”</p> \n<p>A week later, a letter of complaint arrived. It was printed on the headed stationery of the law office where Shahina’s mother worked. It ended by saying that Shahina had met another doctor, who had assured her that there was no possibility that the problem could be psychosomatic.</p> \n<p>More than a year later, I received a letter from another neurologist at a different hospital, who informed me that Shahina’s dystonia had recurred and that she had responded well to a further administration of Botox, but that later the dystonic contraction had moved to her left arm and spread to her trunk. “I am beginning to wonder whether some, if not all, of her problem may be psychological in origin,” it said.</p> \n<p>Even when a diagnosis of psychosomatic illness is delivered carefully, anger is a common response and it can prevent a patient getting the help they need. I have often wondered if the outcome for Shahina could have been different had I managed to communicate my suspicions in a better way.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>In 2011, three GP practices in London identified 227 patients with the severest form of psychosomatic symptom disorder. These 227 constituted just 1% of those practice populations – but estimates suggest up to 30% of GP encounters every day are with patients who have a less severe form of the illness. If psychosomatic symptoms are so ubiquitous, why are we so ill equipped to deal with them?</p> \n<p>Doctors should be less afraid of this diagnosis, more willing to confront it and more compassionate to sufferers. But for us to consider a psychological cause for serious illness, it is vital that we believe such a thing is possible. Maybe if we understood better the way our own bodies lose control, triggered only by a feeling inside, then more extreme reactions might not seem so unacceptable. Think about laughter: it is a physical display of emotion whose mechanism is ill understood; it is not always under our control, it affects our whole body, it stops our breathing and speeds up our heart; it releases tension and communicates feelings. If we can collapse with laughter, is it not just as possible that the body can do even more extraordinary things when faced with even more extraordinary triggers?</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Matthew was a product of the internet age. When he came to me, his research had utterly convinced him that he had <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/society/multiple-sclerosis\">multiple sclerosis</a>. Throughout our first conversation he kept using the words “my multiple sclerosis”. “Is my multiple sclerosis more severe than other people’s? How will my multiple sclerosis affect my life insurance?”</p> \n<p>Matthew’s problem began with a feeling of pins and needles in one foot. At first it affected him only if he sat for prolonged periods. After having the symptoms for nearly two weeks, Matthew went to see his doctor. He was advised to take regular breaks at work and to avoid sitting for too long.</p> \n<p>Matthew noticed his symptoms change and spread. The pins and needles were now moving around his body: one day in an arm, the next over the bridge of his nose, then in the back of his head, then his lower lip. He researched possibilities online. The internet advised him that diabetes could damage the nerves and lead to pins and needles. The doctor told him his blood sugar was normal. He read that trapped nerves were a common cause of his symptoms. A chiropractor wondered if he might have a disc out of place in his neck, but the treatment helped only briefly. Matthew began to exercise regularly. When this did not help, he tried resting as much as possible.</p> \n<p>Nothing Matthew did made him any better. By now he was finding it difficult to work. Sitting for prolonged periods was impossible. His workplace had assessed his office space and made changes, but it made no difference. He cut down his working hours. At the same time he intensified his research. That was when he discovered that multiple sclerosis could cause sensory abnormalities that moved around the body.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c19cf16f496c8a2a918a9d9562da2ff00d7f8fe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431513539002/68a89484-0906-4e42-b250-ad6e1c95ada5-282x420.jpeg\" alt=\"All in head 3\" width=\"282\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Model: Sharifa Safiya at Ugly. Hair and makeup: Johanna Dalemo</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Then, one day, Matthew awoke to find that he had lost all strength in his legs. He had no feeling and no movement. He was admitted to hospital, where he underwent a series of investigations which offered no explanation. A lumbar puncture took a sample of his spinal fluid, and that was normal. Blood tests and electrical studies of his nerves and muscles showed nothing wrong.</p> \n<p>Three weeks later, after a fortnight in hospital with no answers, Matthew’s wife wheeled him into my office. Smartly dressed, with a sheaf of papers on his knee, he greeted me cheerily as his wife pulled up a chair and sat beside him. I asked him to tell his story from the start.</p> \n<p>“I know I have multiple sclerosis,” he began.</p> \n<p>“Let’s not make any assumptions,” I said.</p> \n<p>His story was detailed, but he was strangely casual about his degree of disability for someone who three months earlier had been active and in full-time work. I examined him. Although he was in a wheelchair, he could walk short distances and moved, with difficulty, to the couch. As he lay down, I tested the strength of his muscles one by one. I asked him to lift his leg off the couch. He couldn’t. His face contorted with the effort. His right leg moved a few centimetres, then he cupped his hands under his thigh, to lift it further.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I can't believe it! I came to this hospital with muscle spasm and now I'm being told I'm doing it on purpose</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“Point your toe,” I asked him next.</p> \n<p>Matthew’s foot lay inert, but his face told me he was trying. When I pressed a blunt pin to his leg, he could not feel it. When I applied a vibrating tuning fork to his skin, he felt nothing below the waist. But the power to move or perceive sensations are things over which both the conscious and subconscious mind have some control, so next I tested the things where this is not the case. Despite the lifelessness of his legs, the reflexes reacted as they should. The tone of his limbs felt normal.</p> \n<p>Matthew stood again and I asked him to walk. He locked his knees tightly and walked with straight legs and great difficulty. I asked him to sit on a chair and stand with his arms folded, and after several tries he managed it. He didn’t realise I had tested the same muscle groups in different ways: each time they had behaved differently.</p> \n<p>He went on to have a further MRI scan of his brain and spine – the standard tests for MS – and an electrical study of his nerves. His neurological pathways were intact. When all the results were in, Matthew, his wife and I met again. I knew his concerns and tried to address them from the start. I explained how we make a diagnosis of MS and said none of his tests had shown any evidence of it. What fantastic news, I suggested; MS is a serious illness, but it had been ruled out. I could see Matthew’s face darken and, to his left, his wife’s shoulders heaved and I saw her roll her eyes.</p> \n<p>“I know you are suffering, Matthew. I don’t want to detract from that. But you do not have MS.”</p> \n<p>I said I wondered about a psychological cause.</p> \n<p>“How can you say that? Just because the tests are normal, you assume I’m mad. That’s what doctors say when they don’t know what’s wrong.”</p> \n<p>“There is more than just the tests,” I answered. “The weakness in your legs doesn’t fit with neurological disease. It should come with other clinical signs, altered reflexes or wasted muscles.”</p> \n<p>“But it feels so real, it can’t be nothing.”</p> \n<p>“It feels real because it is real. Your paralysis is not imagined, but that does not necessarily mean that it is a primarily physical disorder.”</p> \n<p>“I don’t feel confident MS has been ruled out.”</p> \n<p>I didn’t answer, and he shook his head</p> \n<p>“For heaven’s sake, Matt, how many times does she have to say it?” his wife said, suddenly. “You don’t have MS. You came here for the doctor’s opinion, so why don’t you try listening to her?”</p> \n<p>“OK.” Matthew agreed, reluctantly.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Six weeks later I met him again and was greeted by a transformation. I hadn’t yet had the psychiatrist’s letter and I was not sure what to expect, but, even from a distance, he looked more content. His wife walked behind the wheelchair as Matthew came into the room and, although she didn’t smile or acknowledge me, I thought I could detect a glimmer of something positive in her, too.</p> \n<p>When Matthew told me how he was doing, there was only good news. His wife had encouraged him to meet the psychiatrist and carry out his own research, and somehow he managed to bring himself to an understanding that there might actually be some truth in my odd diagnosis.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Fantastic news: none of his tests had shown evidence of MS.

It continued to attract intense social disapproval for long after that: as late as 1993, according to the annual British Social Attitudes survey, most people still considered it to be “always wrong”. In this cruel and illiberal atmosphere, politicians with gay inclinations had to keep them secret from the public at large, and ran enormous risks. They were obliged either to repress their sexual feelings and lead celibate lives, or else to lead double lives, indulging their tastes clandestinely while outwardly conducting conventional, heterosexual existences, often married with children.</p> \n<p>Yet paradoxically, “closet queens” (to use an expression that came into vogue in the 1960s) often made effective politicians. They were past masters when it came to keeping secrets, and taking calculated risks; they were also actors on life’s stage, with a strong sense of showmanship, and a flair for intrigue and subterfuge. And there was probably a far higher proportion of homosexuals in politics than in most other walks of life, partly because, as actors and risk-takers, they were drawn to the profession, and also because 20th-century British politicians were often educated at all-male boarding schools, which fostered intense (often sexual) friendships among their pupils, and provided unintentional training in the art of breaking the rules and getting away with it.</p> \n<p>I became aware of this aspect of British political life when I wrote the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jan/18/jeremy-thorpe-review-michael-bloch-gripping-insightful-biography\">biography (published after his death last year) of Jeremy Thorpe</a>, the charismatic Old Etonian who led the Liberal party from 1967 to 1976. Always gallant with “the ladies”, Thorpe married twice, and fathered a son; but he led a hair-raising promiscuous gay life behind the scenes. When it came to both sex and politics he was a master of intrigue, exhibited outstanding seductive qualities and got a kick out of his recklessness. He was eventually obliged to resign as Liberal leader when a former male model revealed that they had conducted an affair many years earlier, when it was still illegal; and he was subsequently tried at the Old Bailey for having allegedly <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/dec/04/jeremy-thorpe\">conspired to have the man in question murdered</a> – though he was acquitted, the revelations of his sex life and his efforts down the years to cover it up left him a discredited figure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"836abadfc89ef2b8fa6fadea882a841178e05ca5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431535643218/1f24af1e-7758-441b-9834-672907ae6a47-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jeremy Thorpe in 1977.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Thorpe in 1977.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA/PA wire</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Many years earlier, two other Old Etonian Liberal politicians had found their careers ruined when they were hounded by men who claimed to have proof of their homosexual activities – the 5th Earl of Rosebery, prime minister in the 1890s, and the 7th Earl Beauchamp, a government minister from 1905 to 1915, subsequently Liberal leader in the House of Lords. They were cousins, who partly owed their early success to handsome looks; both were offered high positions in their 20s and joined the cabinet in their 30s. Both married fabulously rich heiresses – Rosebery, Hannah de Rothschild; Beauchamp, the sister of the 2nd Duke of Westminster. Rosebery’s marriage produced four children, Beauchamp’s no fewer than seven – but both were drawn emotionally to their own sex. (Both seem to have been infatuated by their handsome younger sons, by whose early deaths they were devastated.)</p> \n<p>Rosebery had a liking for personable private secretaries. One of these was Francis, Viscount Drumlanrig, heir to the 9th Marquess of Queensberry, by whose qualities Rosebery was so taken that he arranged for him to be made a junior member of the government at the age of 26. This incensed “the mad marquess”, who was convinced that Rosebery was having an affair with his eldest son, just as he believed that Oscar Wilde was conducting one with his youngest son, Lord Alfred “Bosie” Douglas. Queensberry’s accusations were at first regarded as the ravings of a madman, but received some credence when in the autumn of 1894 – Rosebery having meanwhile become prime minister – Drumlanrig shot himself. Soon afterwards Rosebery suffered a breakdown and went into a state of seclusion: he was said to be terrified that his name would be raised in the libel case that Wilde brought against Queensberry. In 1895, less than a month after Wilde had been sentenced to two years’ hard labour for gross indecency, Rosebery tendered the resignation of his government (though it still commanded a parliamentary majority and no election was due).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0f60f5be42c24eaa80d2365c78316e4e0d6eec74\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536149772/c6f04feb-30c0-4230-897e-b6f49cb39796-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lord Rosebery speaking at the Foreign Office, c1900.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lord Rosebery speaking at the Foreign Office, c1900.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hulton Archive/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Whereas Rosebery had a (possibly platonic) taste for secretaries, Beauchamp’s (by no means platonic) penchant was for footmen and grooms. He continued in these relationships for decades without being exposed, and might have done so indefinitely but for a vendetta by the Duke of Westminster, who was resentful that Beauchamp had, through his marriage to Westminster’s sister, produced three sons, while Westminster’s sole male heir had died aged four. In 1930, Westminster’s agents obtained statements from former servants of what he termed his “bugger-in-law”, testifying to his peccadilloes; confronted with this evidence, Beauchamp resigned and fled into exile. His story provided the background for Evelyn Waugh’s novel <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>: Lord Marchmain, the distinguished peer obliged to live abroad, is based on Beauchamp, while his son, the beautiful but wayward Sebastian, is based on Beauchamp’s adored younger son Hughie, with whom Waugh had been intimate at Oxford.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>As a young cavalry officer, the Old Harrovian Winston Churchill was accused of having “participated in acts of gross immorality of the Oscar Wilde type” with fellow cadets at Sandhurst; but he successfully sued his accuser for libel, and there is no evidence that, as an adult, he engaged in physical homosexual relationships. Yet he was far from being straightforwardly heterosexual. Although he worshipped his beautiful American mother, he showed a lifelong aversion to women. (In Churchill’s only novel <em>Savrola</em>, the obviously autobiographical hero has a purely chaste relationship with the heroine, obviously based on Churchill’s mother.) He seems to have had a low sex drive, and married rather cold-bloodedly, aged 33, for social and dynastic reasons, just after being appointed to Asquith’s cabinet. Though he came to depend on his “Clemmie” in many ways, she was often exasperated by his emotional unresponsiveness and treatment of her as a child-bearer and housekeeper, and more than once considered leaving him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af6f0dc1925fb7033c38b19add41f39ce35a5ed9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431535702693/7e642c1a-140f-469c-aa6b-0ae7a81cf5c1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Winston Churchill c1900.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Winston Churchill c1900.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While he never showed much interest in women other than his wife, Churchill’s life was marked by a series of close platonic relationships with attractive young men. Prominent among these were Eddie Marsh, a civil servant who served devotedly for 25 years as his private secretary, whom Churchill described as “a friend I shall cherish and hold on to all my life”; Archie Sinclair, a cavalry officer, whom he chose as his second in command on the western front in 1916, as his personal assistant as war secretary and colonial secretary in 1919-22, and finally (after Sinclair had become leader of the Liberal party) as air minister in 1940; Bob Boothby, the youngest and handsomest MP, whom Churchill, as chancellor of the exchequer in the 1920s, appointed his PPS despite the bumptious Boothby having criticised his policies; and Brendan Bracken, a young man on the make whom Churchill (to the horror of his family) effectively adopted in the 1920s and who served as his right-hand man during the 1930s, finally becoming information minister during the second world war. (Of these four, Marsh, who developed crushes on young writers and actors, and Boothby, who had a taste for “rough trade” from the criminal underworld, were certainly predominantly homosexual, and Bracken, though he cloaked his private life in impenetrable secrecy, probably, too.) Like Rosebery and Beauchamp, Churchill seems to have had feelings towards his son, Randolph, that verged on the amorous (another factor that estranged him from his wife, who disliked the boy from birth) – though these feelings cooled as Randolph lost his looks owing to excessive drinking, and became a coarse womaniser. In my view, the intensely narcissistic and exhibitionistic Churchill was romantically drawn to men rather than women, even if his relations with them stopped short of the physical.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>The long parliament of 1935-45 contained a clandestine fraternity of homosexual and bisexual politicians who knew each other well, were aware of each other’s tastes and often met socially. Boothby featured prominently in this circle, as did his friend the leftwing MP Tom Driberg, who was addicted to having sex with strangers in lavatories (including those of the House of Commons). Another friend of Boothby was the National Labour MP and wartime minister Harold Nicolson; Nicolson was an active homosexual married to a lesbian, as was the Conservative MP Viscount “Hinch” Hinchingbrooke. Nicolson had two sons by his wife, the writer Vita Sackville-West, while Hinch’s artist wife Rosemary bore him seven children before leaving him to live with a female companion. Also in the circle were two Conservative MPs and close friends, the American-born Henry “Chips” Channon and the Churchill protege Alan Lennox-Boyd, who married sisters, Guinness heiresses, but enjoyed riotous homosexual adventures behind the scenes. Lennox-Boyd had a distinguished ministerial career in several governments, while Channon achieved posthumous fame with his racy diaries (from which any hint of his gay sex life was expunged when they were published in the 1960s). Other MPs in the coterie included the outrageously camp millionaire aesthete Sir Philip Sassoon, who as undersecretary for air befriended young airmen and seems to have had a close relationship with at least one of them; the rich and handsome Sir Paul Latham, who in 1941 became the only serving MP of modern times to go to prison for homosexuality, after attempting to seduce his batman; and Malcolm Bullock, a balletomane and former guards officer on close terms with the royal family. All these men undoubtedly enjoyed the sensation of belonging to a secret society, as well as the thrill of danger that their illegal sex-lives involved (though this should not blind us to the fears, disappointments and lack of self-fulfilment suffered by most gay men, including politicians, until recent times).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"254bee7e628f1e04e437f8f3c70f96c77f0eb7c5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431535776561/3ae6b93d-594d-49f3-8181-388eb042b6c3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Bob Boothby, photographed for the Picture Post in 1949.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bob Boothby, photographed for the Picture Post in 1949.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Haywood Magee/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Boothby is an interesting case, for while continuing relationships with young men he also pursued a long affair, which was common knowledge at Westminster, with Lady Dorothy Macmillan, wife of a fellow Conservative MP, the future prime minister Harold Macmillan; it was she who seduced Boothby and made the running throughout the affair. (When asked what he saw in her, Boothby replied that she reminded him of a caddie he had once met on the links at St Andrews.) The affair, and the impression it gave that Boothby was “a ladies’ man”, provided a smokescreen for his homosexual activities, and also proved helpful when, in 1953, he pressed the home secretary, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe, to set up a body to reconsider the law relating to homosexuality. Maxwell Fyfe was a vicious homophobe, then organising the unprecedented national persecution of homosexuals; and it is curious that he went out of his way to get the cabinet (which was far from keen on the idea) to appoint a committee to examine the matter, chaired by the former public school headmaster John Wolfenden.</p> \n<p>When, in 1957, Wolfenden reported in favour of decriminalising homosexual acts performed between adult males in private, Maxwell Fyfe, now Viscount Kilmuir and lord chancellor, declared that he was “not going down in history as the man who made sodomy legal”. The Conservative government, now led by Macmillan, shared his view, refusing to lay the Wolfenden proposals before parliament; and a long campaign began to get them enacted – which they finally were in 1967, thanks to several courageous parliamentarians who sponsored the necessary legislation, notably the charismatic bisexual Welsh Labour MP Leo Abse. The Labour government that then held office was no keener to be associated with the reform than its Conservative predecessor – though time was allowed for a private member’s bill thanks to the efforts of two ministers who, though they had become thoroughly heterosexual, had enjoyed homosexual adventures as Oxford undergraduates: the home secretary, Roy Jenkins, who had been in love with his future cabinet colleague Tony Crosland; and the leader of the House of Commons, Richard Crossman, who had had an affair with the poet WH Auden.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>It is ironic that the Macmillan cabinet that resisted implementing Wolfenden seems to have contained more “closet queens” than any other of the century. During the years 1959-60, for example, it contained the following homosexual or bisexual members: the chancellor of the exchequer, Derick Heathcoat-Amory, who narrowly avoided scandal after engaging in frolics with “teddy boys” at Margate; the foreign secretary, Selwyn Lloyd, who was in love with his handsome godson and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/1997/jun/21/uk3\">personal assistant Jonathan Aitken</a>; and the colonial secretary, Alan Lennox-Boyd, who though married with three sons conducted a longstanding relationship with a major in the Coldstream Guards.</p> \n<p>The cabinet also included the health secretary, Enoch Powell, who as a classics professor in Australia before the war had written to his parents about his infatuation with his male students; and the minister of labour, the unmarried and misogynistic Edward Heath.</p> \n<p>Three junior members of the government were obliged to resign owing to homosexual scandal: the Foreign Office minister Ian Harvey, who in 1958 was caught with a guardsman in St James’s Park; the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2001/mar/01/guardianobituaries\">Home Office minister Charles Fletcher-Cooke</a>, who in 1961 was found to be living with a former borstal boy; and the science minister Denzil Freeth, whom Lord Denning, during his inquiry into the Profumo affair in 1963, discovered to have “attended a party of a homosexual character and there engaged in homosexual conduct”. It was even rumoured that Macmillan himself had been expelled for homosexuality from Eton (where his elder brother Daniel certainly had a “reputation”; his lovers including the future economist John Maynard Keynes) – though his latest biographer believes it more likely that he was “removed” from the school by his parents when they discovered that he was being “used” by older boys.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f59f6f37188568ada744d2e6e3334b96ca057a4c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536058182/a2020825-106f-4249-845a-c21a2138db20-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Edward Heath after his election victory in 1970.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Heath after his election victory in 1970.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Kemp/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Heath, who became Conservative leader and prime minister, seems to have repressed his sexual nature totally in order to realise his political ambitions. He came from modest social origins, which he never tried to conceal: he was not close to his father, a former carpenter who ran a small building firm, but he worshipped his mother, who had a certain refinement, having worked as a lady’s maid in a country house. She adored her “Teddie”, and pressed him to achieve great things. Inspired by her, Heath was the star of his grammar school and won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford, where he became president of both the Union and the Conservative Association. Unlike his Oxford contemporary and future rival, Harold Wilson, Heath was not brilliant, but an intelligent and dedicated plodder. Following distinguished war service, in which he rose to be a colonel in the artillery, he was elected to parliament in 1950 and spent the ensuing decade as a whip, a role to which his personality – upright, thorough, affable but aloof – was ideally suited. That as government chief whip he managed to keep the party together after the Suez debacle of 1956 was a considerable achievement.</p> \n<p>The Conservatives elected Heath as their leader in 1965 believing he would help them shed their elitist image, but he was an odd choice, awkward in his behaviour and lacking “the common touch”. It caused surprise when he defeated the charismatic Wilson to become prime minister in 1970. In 1975, after his administration been brought down by union militancy, he was replaced as leader by Margaret Thatcher, whom he regarded with an intense loathing that he never tried to conceal. (“When I look at him and he looks at me,” she once remarked, “it doesn’t feel like a man looking at a woman, more like a woman looking at another woman.”) Heath (like his hero, Churchill) was notoriously averse to women, and barely managed to be polite even to the wives of colleagues, but he does not seem to have been close to any men either, and was a self-absorbed, friendless figure.</p> \n<p>Apart from Arthur Balfour, Conservative prime minister from 1902 to 1905 (who, though a narcissistic dandy, was in fact heterosexual and enjoyed sado-masochistic relationships with sophisticated women), Heath is modern Britain’s only bachelor premier, and his unmarried state gave rise to widespread rumour to the effect that he was actively gay – though no reliable evidence has emerged to suggest that he ever had a sexual or even a platonic relationship with anyone. Only in old age did he unbend to the extent of developing flirtatious friendships with some younger gay Tory MPs such as Alan Duncan and Matthew Parris, as well as with the gay couple who decorated his house in Salisbury. During his later years he also supported the lowering of the age of consent for homosexuality from 21 to 18 and then 16, whereas during his active political career he had studiously avoided showing interest in homosexual law reform.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fcae5642282d774b5efd4315844b01c9f8ffa053\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431621536138/652a17c8-5715-4d06-b851-4145ccb0868f-342x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Norman St John Stevas in 1950.\" width=\"342\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman St John Stevas in 1950.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Personalities/AP / TopFoto</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Clandestine homosexuality also flourished in the Labour party; here two contradictory influences were at work. A strain in the party’s development (epitomised by the Fabian Society, and Edward Carpenter’s philosophy of “the dear love of comrades”) preached sexual toleration and the rejection of bourgeois morals; but the party was also deeply rooted in the fierce evangelical Christianity that spearheaded the crackdown on homosexuality during the Victorian era. The Old Etonian Hugh Dalton, a leading figure in the Labour movement and a senior cabinet minister throughout the 1940s, was in love with Rupert Brooke as a Cambridge undergraduate, and later became intimate with several younger Labour politicians whose careers he helped, notably the bisexual Hugh Gaitskell and Tony Crosland. There were also some Labour-supporting peers who, while continuing to “live like lords”, shocked their families by flaunting both their socialism and their homosexuality, such as Oliver Baldwin, son of the Conservative statesman Stanley Baldwin and successor to his earldom, who, appointed a colonial governor by Attlee, barely concealed his “married” relationship with another man; and Gavin Henderson, 2nd Baron Faringdon, who had a penchant for firemen, and turned Buscot, his country house in Oxfordshire, into a venue for party meetings. These men were relaxed about their sexuality; but it was quite otherwise with a man of working-class origins such as the Welsh Labour politician George Thomas, speaker of the House of Commons from 1976 to 1983 (in which role he succeeded another “closet queen”, Selwyn Lloyd), who lived in terror of the exposure of his guilty secret. His homosexuality was revealed after his death by his friend and fellow MP Leo Abse, who had on several occasions helped extricate him from blackmail situations involving young men.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>At the end of the 20th century, two of the most colourful figures in British public life, whose ambiguous sexual natures had recently been made public, were the Conservative Michael Portillo and Labour’s Peter Mandelson (“Polly” and “Mandy”). Despite their political differences, there were some remarkable similarities in their backgrounds. Both were born in 1953, the youngest in families of boys; both had strong-willed mothers, who had married husbands with foreign ancestries of whom their families disapproved. (Portillo’s mother, daughter of a Scottish linen tycoon, married an eminent Spanish refugee professor; Mandelson’s mother, daughter of the Labour statesman Herbert Morrison, married the descendant of Russian revolutionaries who had sought sanctuary in Australia.) Both had suburban London upbringings, became prefects at their excellent local grammar schools, and were interested in the theatre. Portillo went to Peterhouse, Cambridge, where he fell under the influence of the rightwing historian Maurice Cowling, while Mandelson went to St Catherine’s College, Oxford, becoming a protege of the leftwing historian Alan Bullock. Portillo, recommended by Cowling, began his career in the Conservative Research Department, while Mandelson, recommended by Bullock, started as a researcher at the TUC. Both subsequently had a spell working in television – in the early 1980s, Portillo was a researcher on Channel 4’s <em>The Week in Politics</em>, Mandelson a producer on LWT’s <em>Weekend World</em>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"571dd25e7bfec436ccf2d82a8ad678514c3d0380\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536353100/28e11e27-fb06-4ef6-abdb-4a4a8aa0e66b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Peter Mandelson announcing one of his resignations, in 2001.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Mandelson announcing one of his resignations, in 2001.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Their careers then diverged in two respects. Portillo, whose party was in power throughout the years 1979-97, became a cabinet minister in his late 30s, just after Mandelson had entered parliament as a backbench MP. And whereas Portillo was famously the most swaggery politician of his generation (especially after John Major had appointed him defence secretary in 1995), Mandelson was the ultimate scheming “backroom boy”, whose achievement was to engineer Tony Blair’s succession as Labour leader and steer the “New Labour” brand to its great electoral triumph in 1997. (Mandelson worshipped Blair much as Portillo had worshipped Thatcher.) Both performed great services for their parties while becoming widely unpopular: Portillo’s loss of his supposedly safe London seat was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/1999/sep/12/conservatives.uk\">the great shock of the 1997 election</a>, while Mandelson, regarded by many as “a prince of darkness”, was twice made to resign from the cabinet during Blair’s first term of office owing to minor transgressions. Both made comebacks: Portillo (having experienced a Damascene conversion and become a “compassionate Conservative”) returned to parliament in 1999 and was appointed shadow chancellor by William Hague, whom he was widely expected to succeed as Conservative leader; while Mandelson, having become an EU commissioner in 2004, was recalled to the cabinet with a peerage by Gordon Brown in 2008, showing brilliance as a strategist during Labour’s last two years of office. (Though effectively retired from frontline politics, both made their voices heard during and after the recent election campaign.)</p> \n<p>Both Portillo and Mandelson enjoyed the company of women. In his late 20s, Portillo married the girlfriend of his teenage years, Carolyn Eadie; Mandelson shared a flat with Neil Kinnock’s press secretary, Julie Hall. However, it was widely known that Portillo, though enjoying relationships with women, had homosexual interests, while Mandelson was frankly gay. Portillo was attached during his 20s to two institutions in which homosexuality flourished, Peterhouse and the Conservative Research Department, and he did not hold himself entirely aloof from the opportunities offered. Mandelson had two longstanding close relationships, first with a fellow researcher at the TUC, later with the Brazilian Reinaldo da Silva, who was some years younger than himself. Within the space of a year, both their private lives were made public in a spectacular fashion. In 1998, Mandelson, not yet in the cabinet but wielding great (and, in the view of some, sinister) influence behind the scenes as the eminence grise of the Blair government, was inadvertently “outed” on the BBC’s <em>Newsnight</em> by the journalist and former MP Matthew Parris. And in 1999, Portillo, about to stand for re-election to Parliament, admitted in an interview with the Times that he had had “some homosexual experiences as a young person” – whereupon a businessman named Nigel Hart declared in the Mail on Sunday that they had had an affair lasting eight years. Although these revelations do not seem to have harmed Portillo’s standing with the public, concern among fellow Conservative MPs about possible further embarrassing disclosures undoubtedly contributed to his narrow failure to win the party leadership when Hague stood down after the Tory defeat in the 2001 general election.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1817dca3696a610ace631cb5b6ec8e0ce5d99243\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536477552/e04cac80-cf25-4048-9512-6997db6ed926-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Portillo listens to Stephen Twigg's victory speech in Enfield Southgate in the 1997 general election.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Portillo listens to Stephen Twigg’s victory speech in Enfield Southgate in the 1997 general election.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Lamarque/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>The climate for gay politicians showed some dramatic swings during the last quarter of the 20th century. Despite her Methodist upbringing and strait-laced image, Margaret Thatcher, who became prime minister in 1979, was quite tolerant of homosexuality: she was one of the few Tories consistently to support Wolfenden, chose many gay men to serve her, and appointed the flamboyant Norman St John Stevas as one of her leading ministers (though she became irritatated by his love of gossip and sacked him after less than two years). However, the espousal of gay rights by some elements of the left, and the Aids epidemic, resulted in much public disquiet about homosexuality during the 1980s. In the Bermondsey byelection of 1983, the openly gay Peter Tatchell managed to lose the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2013/feb/22/defeat-in-bermondsey-defeat-for-left\">supposedly safe Labour seat to the Liberal Simon Hughes</a> (who later admitted to having gay relationships). In this atmosphere, no MP felt able to “come out” – with the brave exception of Chris Smith, Labour MP for Islington South and Finsbury. In 1988, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2003/nov/17/uk.gayrights\">Section 28 of the Local Government Act</a> provided that a local authority “shall not intentionally promote homosexuality or publish material with the intention of promoting homosexuality”. Though heterosexual, John Major, who succeeded Thatcher in 1990, was favourable to the cause of gay equality. He lifted the ban on homosexuals in “high security positions”, and in 1994 the age of consent was reduced from 21 to 18. However, the great terror for gay MPs in the 1990s was of being “outed” by the press, something which would scarcely have been imaginable in previous decades. The decision of the Murdoch press to launch a “morality crusade” against the Major administration led to the resignation of several gay Tory MPs from minor government positions, and reinforced the impression that the regime was mired in “sleaze”. Meanwhile the militant gay organisation Outrage! targeted MPs it believed to be gay who failed to support gay equality, one of whom, the Ulster Unionist Sir James Kilfedder, died of a heart attack after learning of his “outing”.</p> \n<p>New Labour, elected in 1997, promised a new era of “diversity” and “inclusiveness”. Labour candidates who triumphed in former Tory strongholds included two openly gay men, Stephen Twigg in Enfield Southgate (where he unseated Michael Portillo) and Ben Bradshaw in Exeter (where he won a large majority in the face of a homophobic Conservative campaign). Chris Smith became culture secretary and the first openly gay cabinet minister, his male partner being included in such official occasions as Buckingham Palace garden parties. Great strides were made in reforming the law. The ban on homosexuals in the armed forces was lifted; the age of consent was reduced to 16; Section 28 was repealed; civil partnerships were introduced, giving gay couples the same legal privileges as married couples; and a series of measures made it illegal to discriminate against people, or “incite hatred” against them, on the grounds of their sexual orientation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22b5d3e17b592d8c53953214c0daa1017e70ef7a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431620840725/2d4f6469-ca63-4560-9a7b-0ed5bca310a3-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Chris Smith at the Tate Modern in 2000.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Smith at the Tate Modern in 2000.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yet in 1998 the Blair government witnessed one of the most bizarre gay scandals of the century, when Ron Davies, secretary of state for Wales, resigned after what he termed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2003/mar/10/uk.wales\">“a moment of madness” on Clapham Common</a>, which had led to his being robbed at knifepoint and relieved of his wallet, phone, car and Commons pass. And the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition that took office in 2010, which was equally committed to the cause of gay equality and legislated for “gay marriage”, similarly suffered the loss of a cabinet minister when the Lib Dem David Laws <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2010/may/29/david-laws-quits-expenses-scandal\">resigned as chief secretary to the Treasury</a> after the Daily Telegraph revealed that he had claimed parliamentary expenses for London accommodation belonging to his “long-term partner and secret lover”, a situation disallowed by the expenses rules; he explained that he had wished to keep his sexuality secret out of respect for the feelings of his mother. It seems the age of the political closet queen may not be quite dead yet.</p> \n<p>***</p> \n<p>Is a study of this subject historically or politically relevant? I believe it is, because until recently many politicians (possibly more than one might imagine, for the men in question usually did their utmost to ensure that no details of this aspect of their lives emerged) were obliged to keep secret something important about themselves. And this inevitably affected the way they operated as politicians: apart from inculcating quick wits and sharp antennae, it tended to foster skills in several areas – tact and discretion; acting and showmanship; the “dark arts” of presentation and manipulation; awareness and management of risk. Following the election, Westminster now boasts 32 gay MPs and while one must be thankful that, in Britain, official homophobia is a thing of the past, and that gay men and women, in politics as elsewhere, can now be open about their sexuality, the necessity for homosexuals in public life to hide their nature, though in itself deplorable, did not, perhaps, exercise an entirely negative influence on the 20th-century political scene.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/285589/s/closet-queens/\">Michael Bloch’s <em>Closet Queens</em></a> is published by Little, Brown this month.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431620581836/c8d2f483-58f6-4691-bb2f-025e5cc60e3b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Robin Heighway-Bury@goodillustration.com","altText":"Closet Queens cover image","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Robin Heighway-Bury@goodillustration.com"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431535644551/1f24af1e-7758-441b-9834-672907ae6a47-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jeremy Thorpe in 1977.

She talks about the challenges they faced in their 30-year marriage and about how close The Theory of Everything was to reality</p>","byline":"Joanna Moorhead","body":"<p>Here is Stephen Hawking’s verdict on the movie about his marriage: it needed more science. And here is Jane Hawking’s verdict: it needed more emotion. Those opposing views on The Theory of Everything, which brought Eddie Redmayne an Oscar and a Bafta for his portrayal of Stephen and Felicity Jones Oscar and Bafta nominations for her portrayal of Jane, reveal a great deal about not only the personalities of the world’s most famous scientist and his former wife, but also one of the major strands of difference in their relationship.</p> \n<p>But the truth is that science is probably more absent from the film than emotion, because what the film represents is a triumph of Jane’s experience and persona after decades in which the family was viewed solely through the prism of Stephen’s genius, who as well as being the world’s best-known scientist is also the world’s best-known sufferer of motor neurone disease (MND).</p> \n<p>Today there is an aura of unassuming achievement around Jane, who is sitting in the conservatory overlooking her garden in a quiet corner of Cambridge. Meeting her feels like fast-forwarding through time to meet an older Felicity Jones, so accurately did the actor represent her subject. But then, talking to Jane, it all turns on itself again: the reality was, she says, that she and Stephen met Jones and Redmayne when they were researching their roles, and was later astounded to realise how closely her mannerisms, gestures and speech patterns had been noted. “When I saw the film, I thought: she’s stolen my personality!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"331bbe3046d289c9d7bf01a2c81d5f9586aedf57\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431443290013/21d29ffc-44e6-4fbc-b097-7755e4f83fc2-292x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jane Hawking\" width=\"292\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane Hawking: ‘The &shy;difficulties of dealing with Stephen’s disease were much greater than they appear in the film.’</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Her relationship with Stephen started when both refused to be daunted by the fact that Stephen had just been diagnosed with terminal motor neurone disease. They ploughed into marriage in the face of his parents’ pessimism about its chances of success, and had three children. In the face of pressures that were almost too much to bear, and alongside her friendship with another man, they somehow kept their marriage together for a quarter of a century before ending it with a remarkable degree of equanimity.</p> \n<p>Does the film present an accurate portrait of their marriage, which began at Trinity Hall in Cambridge in 1965?</p> \n<p>“The important thing is that the feelings, where they are there, are very much true to our experiences. So from an emotional point of view, it’s spot on. The only thing is that they’ve had to minimise the strains and struggles, because in our real life the difficulties of dealing with Stephen’s disease were much greater than they appear in the film.”</p> \n<p>And, yes, the impression given in the film that she and Stephen managed to split up without too much acrimony – and that Jane’s new partner and now husband, musician Jonathan Hellyer Jones, became part of their immediate family – is indeed an accurate one (although for a long time after they met, their relationship was platonic).</p> \n<p>Jane met Jonathan when, to give her a break from the constant demands of caring for Stephen, a friend suggested she should take up singing in the local church choir, run by Jonathan. It was 1977. The Hawkings, then parents of two young children, were living in Cambridge, where he was garnering a reputation as one of the most glittering scientists of his generation. Jane, though, was isolated and overwrought. How much were the demands on their marriage the product of Stephen’s disease – without it, might they still be married today? Jane isn’t sure: although his health was a huge strain, there were others. From the outset, Stephen’s “eccentric” family made no secret of the fact that they didn’t think the marriage would survive.</p> \n<p>“Stephen’s mother once said to me, ‘We don’t like you because you don’t fit into our family.’” On another occasion she learned by chance that the Hawkings were planning to move to Cambridge so they could be there when the marriage foundered, as they were sure it eventually would.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"90a4a53af615f7e2d178a5e95a5453caa7a04bbe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431522152931/59aa72f8-7f88-4f6d-af00-d54545fbc208-324x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jane and Stephen Hawking\" width=\"324\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jane and Stephen Hawking in 1974.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But it wasn’t just about a lack of support from the wider family. “The truth was, there were four partners in our marriage,” says Jane. “Stephen and me, motor neurone disease and physics. If you took out motor neurone disease, you are still left with physics. Mrs Einstein, you know, cited physics as a difference for her divorce ...”<br /></p> \n<p>During their marriage, she says, Stephen would retreat into himself. And, though he tried to explain physics to her, she always felt shut out of the world that was so crucial to him. But the stresses of MND were not solely or even mostly down to the physical difficulties of the condition; what brought even greater disruption to their lives was the advent of the carers who shared their home, who disapproved of aspects of their lives, and whose presence meant they could never have the privacy that every family needs to thrive.</p> \n<p>“They whispered about us and they undermined me,” says Jane. It’s clear the pain is still there. One of those nurses, Elaine Mason, went on to become his second wife, though the two later divorced. This is an episode of their lives Jane is reluctant to rake over, although it was this relationship that tipped the Hawkings into splitting up, rather than her relationship with Jonathan. Why did they carry on for so long, even after she had met Jonathan and become close to him? She says it never felt like a choice: she loved Jonathan and depended on him for support, but she absolutely loved Stephen as well.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-454192060__\n</div> \n<p>“There was no alternative to just carrying on. I felt very committed to Stephen, and I didn’t think he could manage without me. I wanted him to carry on doing his amazing work, and I wanted the children to have a stable family behind them – so we just carried on.”</p> \n<p>In real life, as in the film, Jonathan became part of the family, sharing the workload of caring for Stephen with Jane, and helping bring up the children. He had been widowed a couple of years before they met. “What brought us together,” says Jane, “was loneliness. We were both very lonely people, and then we found one another.”</p> \n<p>So the formal split in the Hawkings’ marriage didn’t come until the early 1990s, by which time the oldest children were in their late teens and 20s and the youngest late addition, Timothy, was 10. In real life, as in the film, Jane says there is no doubt that Timothy is Stephen’s child, not Jonathan’s. She is proud of the way she and Stephen and Jonathan kept their lives on an even track for so long. “But once the breakup happened, things absolutely exploded. The lines of communication became much more difficult for a while.”</p> \n<p>Even when a marriage has petered out gradually, it still takes time to recover, she says. “They reckon you have to allow at least one year for every five years of marriage to recover before you can pick up the reins and find yourself again.”</p> \n<p>Jane and Jonathan eventually married in 1997. How has that union compared with her first one? “I don’t think of my life as having two marriages, I think of it as a continuum,” she says. “We all lived in such harmony, and for so long, until the divorce and the disruption.”</p> \n<p>But her two relationships have been very different. “I’ve been able to lean on Jonathan – we can lean on one another,” she says.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-443996280__\n</div> \n<p>“Whereas in the past with Stephen, he was dependent on me all the time. He worked very hard and he was very successful, but I never felt I could lean on him emotionally or confide in him.”</p> \n<p>Another difference is that, where physics divided her and Stephen because she was not of that world, music unites her and Jonathan: he is head of music at Magdalene College, and Jane sings regularly in choirs and as a soloist.</p> \n<p>Today, Stephen lives just round the corner from Jane and Jonathan. When we meet, she has just returned from visiting him, and they’re all planning to meet for Sunday lunch with Lucy, the couple’s daughter, at the weekend.</p> \n<p>Stephen has taken part in many of the publicity events for The Theory of Everything, which was based on Jane’s memoir of their time together. Now 71, she and Jonathan divide their life between Cambridge and their house in northern France, and she makes regular visits to Seattle where her and Stephen’s eldest child, Robert, works for Microsoft and has a son and a daughter.</p> \n<p>Lucy is the mother of an autistic son, so as a grandmother Jane has taken up the cudgels she once employed as a wife, and campaigns for better rights for disabled people – her current battle centres on the cuts to the Independent Living Fund, which she says will stop people like her grandson from living independent lives. It has brought her full circle, and she feels as passionately about it as she ever did.</p> \n<p>“Being Stephen’s carer was such a struggle, and it’s a lonely job looking after a disabled person. Thinking back, I honestly wonder how I got through it. But what you hope is that the years since have brought improvements to the lives of disabled people and their carers, and I think for a while it was like that. But now the clock is turning back, and we can’t let that happen.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><em> The Theory of Everything is out on DVD</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431427194229/Jane-and-Stephen-with-the-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'There was no alternative to just carrying on.

You turned up on the last snowy day of the year. The next day the snow thawed and your arrival seemed to have heralded spring – a new start for the year and a fresh beginning in my life. I’d told people I’d loved them before, but never knew feelings could be so intense until I saw you that first time. I was a dad. Here was someone I would lay down my life for. Someone for whom I would fight to the death. Total, unconditional love. Someone I was going to see grow up, go to university, find love, then maybe settle down and have his own family.</p> \n<p>I quickly fell out with my parents, and, like all good family disputes, it was over money. They wanted to give you half of everything in their wills, but in their usual Yorkshire thrifty mind-set were doing it on the cheap. I pointed out that a young adult with tens of thousands of pounds in his hand wasn’t sensible and told them to spend some of the money on solicitors. I wanted to hope for the best, but plan for the worst.&nbsp;I hate myself for being right.</p> \n<p>You didn’t play very well. In a room full of 30 kids, there you would be, flitting from toy to toy, with no concern for the people around you and ignoring any child who engaged with you. You would only talk to adults when you wanted them to do something – something you couldn’t do for yourself or, as time went on, just things you couldn’t be bothered doing. You appeared to be in your own world a lot of the time. You spoke sparingly. Development came in stops and starts, but by four you were firmly on the special needs radar and not long before you started school the official diagnosis of autism was given.</p> \n<p>I hate myself for being right still. You love your mother, which is good – because you make her life hell. Without your outward signs of affection towards her I don’t know if she could maintain the abuse you put her through. I’ve watched a loving, kind woman become a tired, hard, uncaring, dispassionate bitch. But all this is aimed at me, with you only getting the occasional frustrated tone, or at worst a sigh of irritation.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>She loves you with all her heart, but that means there is no room for anything else. She will fight for you until her last breath. But any type of intimacy between the two of us has vanished. In six years she’s aged 20 while I’ve put on 30lb and have become more isolated than ever. I hold back as much as I can, but sometimes I snap. I’m sorry. I know it distresses you when we argue, and I hate myself for doing it.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>I feel bereaved – for the family I should have had. I am a good person and this should not be happening to me. I avoid alcohol because I’m worried one day I will do something silly. I make plans to leave, but never do. I know your mother does the same because she “accidentally” left open on the computer an instant-message exchange she was having with her sister. I honestly don’t know what the future will bring.</p> \n<p>But we love you more than ever. You’re not responsible for any of this – it’s your disability. We know that you try your best, but you become confused and anxious about everything that is going on around you.&nbsp; Neither your mother nor I know what the future will hold, but we still feel the same way about you today as that first time we saw you.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>You’re a young boy and you need me and your mother nearby. I will do my best, but I expect that I will make mistakes. But I guess I inherited some of that Yorkshire thriftiness as well because I’ve made a commitment and I’m staying in your life. And I expect a return on it in 11 years, 47 weeks and four days when you’re old enough to buy me that pint.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><em>Dad</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-16T05:44:16Z","lastModified":"2015-05-16T05:44:16Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Autism","Parents and parenting","Society","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"society/autism","webTitle":"Autism"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"A letter to ...","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/aletterto"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/a-letter-to-my-son-who-has-autism-for-whom-ill-always-do-my-best","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/488kx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/a-letter-to-my-son-who-has-autism-for-whom-ill-always-do-my-best","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/a-letter-to-my-son-who-has-autism-for-whom-ill-always-do-my-best"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"A letter to ..."},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"You should cocoa / Recipes for sumptuous chocolate cakes and brownies","rawTitle":"Recipes for sumptuous chocolate cakes and brownies","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/cocoa-chocolate-baking-recipes-birthday-cake-brownies-ruby-tandoh","title":"You should cocoa: sumptuous recipes for chocolate cakes and brownies","trailText":"<strong>Ruby bakes: </strong>In baking, humble cocoa powder is easier to work with and stronger than expensive chocolate, and can hold its own against the other ingredients.

See for yourself in these easy birthday cake and treacle brownie recipes.</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>As good as it is to bake with chocolate – chopped, grated, melted, in slabs, chipped, or shaved into wafer-thin curls – every chunk of the stuff that I put into a cake batter or brownie mix is one less chunk for me just to snaffle at the kitchen counter. It can feel wasteful – and expensive – to slip good-quality dark chocolate into your baking, where it’s muted by all of the sugar and butter, its subtleties lost entirely. I prefer to bake with cocoa powder: it is more potent and bitter than processed chocolate, and with the depth of flavour to enable it to hold its own against the other ingredients in a recipe. Because it’s a powder, too, it’s far easier to incorporate without affecting the texture or mouthfeel of the bake.</p> \n<h2><strong>Black treacle cocoa brownies with clotted cream</strong></h2> \n<p>Black treacle adds a bittersweet depth to these brownies – they’re perhaps the richest and most chocolatey I’ve ever had. Spoonfuls of clotted cream for serving help to balance this sweetness, sitting bright against the dark clout of the cocoa and treacle. Bake these until they’re barely set for an almost melting, squidgy middle.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 9</strong><br />150g unsalted butter<br />3 tbsp black treacle<br />275g caster sugar<br />90g plain flour<br />75g cocoa powder<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />2 large eggs<br />150g clotted cream, to serve</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/04/chocolate-recipes-choc-chip-cookie-ganache-tart-10-best\">Our 10 best chocolate recipes | Our 10 Best</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and line a 15x22cm rectangular tin with baking parchment. Any similar sized tin will do – a 20cm round cake tin will be more or less equivalent in volume, while a 20x20cm square tin will give you a slightly shallower brownie (be sure to decrease the baking time accordingly).</p> \n<p>2 Melt the butter over a low heat, then whisk in the treacle and sugar. Stir the flour, cocoa powder and salt together in a separate bowl, breaking up any rogue clumps as you go. Whisk the eggs, one at a time, into the melted butter mixture, then lightly beat in the dry ingredients, just until the batter is smooth. Don’t worry if the mixture’s slightly grainy.</p> \n<p>3 Spoon the brownie batter into the prepared tin and lightly smooth the surface. Place in the oven to bake for 25-35 minutes. Exactly how long it takes to cook will vary according to the size and shape of your tin, but the most important thing is not to over-bake the brownie. For a perfectly dense, fudgy texture, cook until the brownie mix no longer jiggles in the centre when you gently shake the tin. The surface should be dried and even, and a knife inserted into the centre should come out with just a little sticky batter on it – don’t wait until the knife emerges totally clean, or you’ll have cooked it for too long.</p> \n<p>4 Leave the brownie to cool completely in its tin before serving in nine generous chunks, with scoops of thick clotted cream alongside.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Every chunk of chocolate I put in a cake or brownie batter is one less chunk for me to snaffle at the kitchen counter</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Easy cocoa birthday cake</strong></h2> \n<p>Chocolate cake is all or nothing: if it’s not hyperbolically rich and chocolatey, it’s not worth making. It’s tempting, then, to throw everything you have into it – melted chocolate, chocolate chips or chunks, swirls of salted caramel or a capful of booze – to make it the best that it can be. But though I’m all for a commitment to extravagance, for me the best chocolate cakes are all the better for being pared back. Rather than weighing down the cake with extras here, I’ve just made a simple cocoa powder batter complemented by light brown sugar, vanilla, coffee and salt. The sugar adds a toffee edge to the sweetness, vanilla and coffee bolster the chocolate flavour, while the salt brings the whole thing into focus. No expensive chocolate, no fuss or fiddly detail – just a perfect chocolate cake.</p> \n<p>You could swap the cocoa buttercream for a richer chocolate ganache, made with dark chocolate melted into an equal weight of scalding double cream, but I think that the heaviness of ganache smothers the mild cocoa kick of the cake. A compromise, if you want something a little more grown up, would be to ice the cake as detailed below, chill it well then glaze with a thin coat of ganache afterwards.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br />275g salted butter, very soft<br />275g soft light brown sugar<br />2 &frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />4 large eggs<br />225g plain flour<br />75g cocoa powder<br />3 tsp baking powder<br />150ml weak black coffee</p> \n<p><strong> For the buttercream</strong><br />225g salted butter, softened<br />50g cocoa powder<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />325g icing sugar<br />2 tsp instant coffee dissolved in 2 tsp water</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Grease two 20cm round cake tins (loose-bottomed or springform are best) and line their bases with circles of baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Beat the butter with the soft light brown sugar in a large mixing bowl for several minutes, creaming the mix until it is perfectly smooth and light. Stir in the vanilla extract. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well between each addition to minimise clumping and curdling. Stir the flour, cocoa powder and baking powder together, then add this mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing just until smooth. Add the dissolved coffee and fold it in to create a soft, velvety cake batter.</p> \n<p>3 Divide the batter between the two prepared tins and bake for 30-35 minutes, until well-risen and springy to the touch. A small knife inserted into the centre of each cake should emerge with no more than a couple of crumbs stuck to it. Leave the cakes to cool completely in their tins before unmoulding.</p> \n<p>4 For the buttercream, beat the butter until smooth, then stir in the cocoa powder and vanilla extract. Sift in the icing sugar a third at a time, mixing well as you go. The buttercream should be luxuriantly thick, but still soft enough to spread on the cakes without ripping them. Add a dash of milk or coffee to slacken the mixture, if necessary.</p> \n<p>5 Smooth a thick layer of cocoa buttercream over one of the cooled cake layers, then sandwich with the second layer and ice the top. Spread the remaining cocoa buttercream generously around the sides of the cake.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The best brownies are …\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/untitled_form_19_copy_12_copy_11_copy\" title=\"COOK May 16 Ruby Bakes\" width=\"100%\" height=\"350\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431598532909/5920533b-d247-4ee1-ac59-e27cb263a026-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"An easy birthday cake and squidgy chocolate brownies made easier with cocoa powder.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-16T05:00:22Z","lastModified":"2015-05-16T05:00:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":7,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style","Chocolate"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/chocolate","webTitle":"Chocolate"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/cocoa-chocolate-baking-recipes-birthday-cake-brownies-ruby-tandoh","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48qd9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/cocoa-chocolate-baking-recipes-birthday-cake-brownies-ruby-tandoh","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/cocoa-chocolate-baking-recipes-birthday-cake-brownies-ruby-tandoh"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431598532909/5920533b-d247-4ee1-ac59-e27cb263a026-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An easy birthday cake and squidgy chocolate brownies made easier with cocoa powder.

I&nbsp;need a new hose fitting, and some kind of caustic chemical to dissolve the calcified haze on the kitchen skylight caused by the constant dripping from the overflow outlet of&nbsp;the upstairs toilet.</p> \n<p>“Get me some gravel,” my wife says when I announce my intentions.</p> \n<p>“OK,” I say. “I’ll be back before lunch.”</p> \n<p>I realise my mistake as I pull into the car park: it’s full. Hundreds of other people have stood in their gardens this morning and thought: “I could be having a barbecue on my&nbsp;deck, if only I had a barbecue. Or&nbsp;a deck.”</p> \n<p>I’m not alone in my failure to anticipate the busiest DIY shopping day of the year so far; the management of this particular superstore seem no less taken aback. They’re fresh out of gravel, and almost everything else I’ve come for. I fill my trolley anyway – I’m here, I think, so I’ll pick up a shovel. And some topsoil.</p> \n<p>Only three tills are open, and the&nbsp;queues stretch into the aisles. The one I’m in has grown two branches; at some point I will have to reach an accommodation with the man standing in the equivalent position in the other fork. I’ve already decided to let him go first – he has a small child and a lawnmower – but I don’t want him to know that yet. The mutual hostility of our exchanged glances is&nbsp;my only entertainment.</p> \n<p>In spite of the gridlock, the staff are demonstrating a spectacular lack of urgency. Nothing is moving. I scowl at the guy with the lawnmower again, then look away quickly. As I&nbsp;close my eyes and lock my jaw, something dawns on me.</p> \n<p>Ten minutes later, I’m in the kitchen, recounting the moment to my wife.</p> \n<p>“I just thought, what’s the point?” I say.</p> \n<p>“Wait,” she says. “Have you actually come back empty-handed?”</p> \n<p>“I left my trolley in the paint aisle and walked out,” I say. “It was incredibly liberating.”</p> \n<p>“I see,” she says.</p> \n<p>“I realised that life is short,” I say. “And also that I didn’t have any money on me.”</p> \n<p>“Right,” my wife says.</p> \n<p>“I’ve gained understanding, and it cost me nothing,” I say.</p> \n<p>“I suppose not,” she says.</p> \n<p>“Apart from the pound for the trolley. Still, it feels like a victory.”</p> \n<p>“It’s lovely that you’re able to look at it that way,” she says.</p> \n<p>The middle one walks in and opens the fridge. “Look at what what way?” he says.</p> \n<p>“Your father went to buy gravel and forgot his wallet,” my wife says. “Now he’s pretending he had an epiphany.”</p> \n<p>“They were out of gravel,” I say. “I’m never going there again.”</p> \n<p>“You never go anywhere anyway,” she says.</p> \n<p>“He goes to the supermarket sometimes,” the middle one says.</p> \n<p>“I went to the supermarket yesterday,” I say. “On what was, I&nbsp;now see, my final visit.”</p> \n<p>“Great,” my wife says.</p> \n<p>An hour later, I’m up on the kitchen roof scraping the calcified haze off the skylight with a razor blade. Doing the best job possible with the tools available is, it turns out, pretty unrewarding: progress is&nbsp;slow, and the squeak of blade against glass stomach-turning.</p> \n<p>I look up and see the youngest one staring at me from a window. “Can I have a go?” he says.</p> \n<p>I look down at the glass, carefully composing my features. “Um, yeah,” I say.</p> \n<p>He climbs out of the window, and I climb in.
