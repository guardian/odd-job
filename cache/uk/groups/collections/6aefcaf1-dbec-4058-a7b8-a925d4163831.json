She’s wearing a red top hat, a heart-patterned dress and a huge smile. Flirting workshops have long been a popular choice for hen parties and singles nights but when couples seek flirting tips it’s often couched in the context of counselling or a desperate attempt to “spice things up”.</p> \n<p>What’s changed is that couples these days attend flirting workshops for fun. “Couples at the workshops are almost always in a good place in their relationship,” says Mackenzie. “They can work on it and have a fun night out.”</p> \n<p>Flirting with a partner is different from flirting to bag one. Without the fear of rejection, flirting becomes a simple renewal of the “I love yous” you’ve already exchanged, rather than a jump-start you only reach for when the relationship starts to sputter. “The first few months of a relationship are intense,” says Mackenzie, “then we think, ‘they’re bagged’. But a relationship can’t run on those six months. Would you expect your car to run on six months of petrol?”</p> \n<h2>Silliness</h2> \n<p>Mackenzie tells us to laugh. The fake-ophony of “hahaha” is so difficult to maintain I’m almost relieved when we’re instructed to tickle the people either side of us.</p> \n<p>When we’ve finished assaulting strangers, Mackenzie explains the reason for the silliness: it facilitates flirting.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdf1b44dbe91db55378136eda8c6603d0c67921b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217630776/60e84db3-bded-4570-b464-25f0b5716533-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kiss me, you fool.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Seriousness tends to creep into early-stage relationships when you’re establishing how “serious” you are about one another and being honest about fear of heartbreak and abandonment. And no one ever flirted successfully with the opening line: “If you leave me, I swear to god …”</p> \n<p>Eschewing seriousness is easy for my partner and me. Five years in, we’re past the “where is this going?” stage, but far from worrying about primary school places or lice. We planned a wedding day prank before we booked a venue. We have silliness down pat. Next.</p> \n<h2>Simmering</h2> \n<p>“Sometimes you’re not feeling that sexy,” says Mackenzie in the workshop, “so collect sexy feelings and build them into a sensation you can have later when you see your partner.”</p> \n<p>I’m unsure as to where I can store a “sexy feeling” until my fiance staggers through the door, battered and war-weary from the commute. So the next weeknight, I try something else Mackenzie advises and envision myself running up and giving him a great big hug and kiss.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55200ba7869f5e26f31c721fd72b5eb988ad258e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217291983/fb2b6f35-e795-4438-a49f-35a0ab970900-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">We have silliness down pat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I hear the key in the door and almost trip over the cat as I rush to comply with my “vision”. We’ll call that a dress rehearsal.</p> \n<p>It goes down much better than the usual grunt from behind a computer screen. Later, as he chops vegetables and I finish an article, we find ourselves catching each other’s eye and smiling.</p> \n<p>“It’s working,” he says. “We’re adorable. I kind of hate us.”</p> \n<h2>Thoughtfulness</h2> \n<p>What could be more flirtatious than showing you’re thinking about your partner’s desires?</p> \n<p>“It can be as simple as buying tickets to a football match you know they want to see.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c3f531a326f40587de7c7acb8d4d61cfaf29e32\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217390108/48f35032-db87-479a-820c-f0263ada99e0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tickets!</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If thoughtfulness were a competition, I’d be losing. We lived with his father for a while, and I had a kettle in my room and would pop downstairs for milk. One morning I went down earlier than usual and happened upon my father-in-law-to-be strolling around naked in the kitchen.</p> \n<p>From that day on, my partner left a jug of milk on my bedside table while I was sleeping. Every morning. How am I supposed to top that?</p> \n<p>Since he’s been complaining that he can’t resist the omnipresent office treats, I slip a bag of almonds into his jacket pocket with a note that says: “Don’t eat cake”. I’ll work on it.</p> \n<h2>Self-love</h2> \n<p>Self-deprecation jars with the act of flirting, says Mackenzie. You wouldn’t offer homemade cookies saying: “Would you like one? I understand if not: they’re doughy and nowhere near as sexy as they used to be.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43f3225f25c73aa7e830e89d84187b865e9cc784\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217459307/24a1ecfb-65b1-4943-ba1f-1b4402a8de80-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mr Potato Head, holding a pair of eyeballs with hearts on them, clearly feeling self-love.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m a rampant self-deprecator, so I start small. I don’t croon “I’m irresistible”. But when he tells me I look nice I say “thanks” instead of turning my belly button into a mouth-puppet and making it say: “No, she looks like a Teletubby with tits.”</p> \n<p>This unnerving alter-ego of low self-esteem – or, as we call it, “Belly Furtado” – has no place in a flirtatious situation. I know that now.</p> \n<h2>Role play</h2> \n<p>Mackenzie suggests: “Tell your partner to wear certain clothes and meet you to role play fantasy figures.”</p> \n<p>We decide to be ourselves in a parallel universe where we never met in a philosophy tutorial and awkwardly made arrangements to see Shrek 2, to which one of us turned up doused in CK1 cologne. I won’t say which one.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"25d9854b1d91f1e79e55b9eeb86aabda1944540f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432217571292/ec1f5a51-9308-41a2-8f37-26436630863d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato men \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I am irresistible.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Saturday evening, a few days after the workshop, I sit on a train and try not to giggle as he gets on and pretends not to know me. He saunters over.</p> \n<p>“Hello. I fancy you. Would you like to watch Netflix with me this evening? In pyjamas?”</p> \n<p>“That’s the creepiest chat-up line I’ve ever heard.”</p> \n<p>“You would though, wouldn’t you?”</p> \n<p>“Yes.”</p> \n<p>This is where couples have the edge over singles when it comes to flirting: your partner already knows what you like and how you like it. And that, put to good use, is irresistible.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432138362101/Potato-men-for-Do-Somethi-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Collect sexy feelings and build them into a sensation you can have later when you see your partner.'

Chucking a load of ingredients into the pan and hoping for the best doesn’t really wash here, however hard you scrub.</p> \n<p>Softer and crumblier than toffee, smoother and richer than its close relative, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jan/22/how-to-make-perfect-tablet-recipe\">tablet</a>, its dairy content means fudge is associated particularly with the south-west, though shops churning it out in a mind-boggling array of weird and only occasionally wonderful flavours are de rigueur in tourist honeypots throughout the British Isles. But before you can hope to achieve gingerbread latte-flavoured nirvana, you need a decent basic template. Which is where I come in.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f065b50c0df00b1649efd4ede1e3f264952dc6c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945038112/489c17fb-823b-4928-8bbc-15c242138ea4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Carnation's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carnation’s fudge recipe stipulates demerara sugar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The sugar</h2> \n<p>Lest anyone was under any illusions in this department, the main ingredient of fudge is sugar – that’s why you can feel your teeth wince in protest as you reach for yet another piece. If you want to keep things simple, like candy <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">pros Mrs Hope and Mr Greenwood</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">folk from Rodda’s clotted cream</a> and <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/caramel-mousse-recipe\">Michelin-star chef Tom Aikens</a>, this can be caster or ordinary white granulated, but given sugar plays such a large part, the demerara suggested by the <a href=\"https://www.carnation.co.uk/recipes/67/Ultimate-Fudge\">Carnation condensed milk tin</a> or the light muscovado used by <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/creamy-sea-salted-fudge-recipe/#ftsTEEwRpKOcplKw.97\">Ren Behan in Jamie magazine</a> will give a more interesting flavour. Personally, I prefer the slightly more subtle caramel notes of the first here.</p> \n<p>Aikens and Roddas both also add some sugar syrup – boring glucose in the former case, ambrosial golden in the latter – which makes their fudge wonderfully smooth as opposed to the slightly gritty, sandy texture of the Carnation and Hope and Greenwood recipes, which, though undoubtedly pleasing, is more reminiscent of Scottish tablet. Clearly feeling two types of sugar aren’t quite enough, Aikens finishes his fudge with an infinitesimal amount of icing sugar, for, no doubt, very sound Michelin-starred reasons which I am unable to fathom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15f50824423376fe7324855e6d5deb45f925ddde\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945143833/02911193-5340-4c62-9f42-70adb1e18073-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roddas's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roddas’s fudge goes all out with clotted cream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The dairy</h2> \n<p>The second, and most important, ingredient in fudge is fat. Dairy fat to be precise. Some recipes cleverly combine the two ingredients in one big hit of nauseatingly delicious condensed milk, which makes their fudge taste distinctly like white chocolate – not that there’s anything wrong with this, but it’s not the classic flavour I’m after.</p> \n<p>Hope and Greenwood plump for the nostalgic boiled flavour of evaporated milk instead, an ingredient that has so far failed to reinvent itself for a more decadent age. Despite a weird complaint that it tastes “meaty”, I happen to like it, but not as much as the clotted cream which plays an unsurprisingly large part in the Roddas recipe, or the double variety in Aikens’s fudge.</p> \n<p>In fact, the Roddas recipe proves pretty popular; soft, smooth and rich, it’s classic Cornish seaside stuff. My only complaint is that the flavour is a little too sweet and rich, which I admit may sound ridiculous, but in a side-by-side comparison, we preferred those recipes using butter as well. Let’s be honest, everything’s better with butter. But, as butter and clotted cream could prove a fatal combination, a downgrade to double seems just what the doctor ordered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb2e571089756166bf95884fb673baae2a7c905b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945257884/e7b22b5b-562c-436a-b61f-86987205051f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ren Behan's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ren Behan’s recipes uses vanilla extract.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The flavouring</h2> \n<p>Though to make this a fair test I omit Hope and Greenwood’s peanut butter (anything containing peanut butter is always going to win big for me), I do allow Roddas, Behan and Aikens their vanilla. Not strictly necessary for a satisfactory result, but a lovely combination of flavours nevertheless – and this is one place where I think vanilla extract works better than those fiddly little seeds. Salt is another must – as ever, it brings out the best in the sugar, keeping it just the right side of sickly. How much you add depends on how enthusiastically you have embraced salted caramel mania over the last few years; sceptics will be content with a pinch, salt fiends like myself should up the dosage considerably. In for a penny, in for a pound.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28087b3b2da0edb1419a066bbbc37cab6d8e9da5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945369181/d110d9e0-c45d-47e4-9883-ecdc4f5be5c9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Aikens fudge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Aikens uses a high temperature to produce a more brittle fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>All the recipes I try start in much the same way, dissolving the sugar and dairy together over heat, bringing the resulting mixture to the boil, and then letting it simmer until it reaches the desired setting temperature. (Covering the pan, as Roddas suggest, works fine, but feels a bit scary to me; I prefer to keep my molten sugar where I can see it.)</p> \n<p>The difference comes in temperature, which ranges from 113C from Behan, which gives a very soft, almost fondant-like result, to Aikens’s 121C, which is brittle and chewy, more like a hard caramel than a fudge. Even Hope and Greenwood and Carnation’s 118C is a bit harder than I had expect from a fudge – my testers and I agree that Roddas have hit the sweet spot at 116C: firm enough to hold its shape, soft enough to melt in the mouth.</p> \n<p>Lots of recipes give advice about how to achieve this without a sugar thermometer (dropping a little into a glass of cold water until it reaches a pliable consistency), but this is a fiddly and inexact science, so I’d recommend investing in a sugar thermometer. They’re not expensive, and they’ll work forever (though be careful when washing as they can be delicate).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff868836c9b6e7193c7f55d0a3b6ca6c64059f29\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945538506/71cf141a-be66-4573-94d9-0c1097f9e045-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hope &amp; Greenwood's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hope &amp; Greenwood’s fudge has a slightly gritty texture.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Stirring?</h2> \n<p>Fudge, like tablet, is beaten as it cools to help it thicken.

Though he is little known in the west, Maqdisi’s importance in the canon of radical Islamic thought is unrivalled by anyone alive. The 56-year-old Palestinian rose to prominence in the 1980s, when he became the first significant radical Islamic scholar to declare the Saudi royal family were apostates, and therefore legitimate targets of jihad. At the time, Maqdisi’s writings were so radical that even Osama bin Laden thought they were too extreme.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/10/isis-onslaught-has-broken-al-qaida-its-spiritual-leaders-admit\">Isis onslaught has broken al-Qaida, its spiritual leaders admit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Today, Maqdisi counts the leader of al‑Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahiri, as a personal friend, and he is held in the highest esteem by the rest of al-Qaida’s regional heads, from North Africa to Yemen. His numerous books and pamphlets are required reading for Islamic militants around the world, who eagerly follow the latest proclamations on Maqdisi’s website, the Pulpit of Monotheism and Jihad. But he may be best known for personally mentoring <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2006/jun/09/guardianobituaries.alqaida\">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a>, who founded the organisation that would later become <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/isis\">Isis</a>, while the two men were jailed together on terrorism charges in Jordan in the mid-1990s. Zarqawi was released in 1999 and, after swearing allegiance to al-Qaida, went on to become one of the most notorious figures in postwar Iraq, unleashing a brutal campaign of sectarian terror, which led Maqdisi to publicly upbraid his most famous student in a series of devastating public critiques.</p> \n<p>Now the man US terrorism analysts call “the most influential living jihadi theorist” has turned his ire toward Isis – and emerged, in the last year, as one of the group’s most powerful critics. Soon after the Isis leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/middle-east-live/2014/jun/30/isis-declares-caliphate-in-iraq-and-syria-live-updates\">declared the establishment of a caliphate</a> last June, Maqdisi released a long tract castigating Isis as ignorant and misguided, accusing them of subverting the “Islamic project” that he has long nurtured.</p> \n<p>Maqdisi’s war of words with Isis is emblematic of the new fratricidal split within violent Islamic radicalism – but it is also a sign that al-Qaida, once the world’s most feared terrorist network, knows it has been surpassed.</p> \n<p>Isis has not simply eclipsed al-Qaida on the battlefields of Syria and Iraq, and in the competition for funding and new recruits. According to a series of exclusive interviews with senior jihadi ideologues, Isis has successfully launched “a coup” against al-Qaida to destroy it from within. As a consequence, they now admit, al-Qaida – as an idea and an organisation – is now on the verge of collapse.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>On a sunny spring afternoon, </strong>three weeks after his release from prison, Maqdisi sat on a sofa at his friend <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/abu-qatada\">Abu Qatada</a>’s house, fuming about Isis: the group had lied to him and betrayed him, he said, and its members were not worthy of calling themselves mujahideen. “They are like a mafia group,” Abu Qatada added, while Maqdisi nodded his assent.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-451845729__\n</div> \n<p>Abu Qatada – who successive British home secretaries tried to deport to Jordan on terror-related charges – has joined Maqdisi as one of the most prominent radical clerics to publicly attack Isis, and his statements of condemnation have been even more scathing. Initially, their strategy seemed to be to bring Isis back under the authority of al-Qaida, using something like a good cop, bad cop approach: Maqdisi played the role of the disappointed father, admonishing and giving guidance in equal measure, while Abu Qatada has poured increasing amounts of scorn on them.</p> \n<p>The list of Isis’s crimes that have offended Maqdisi and Abu Qatada is long. They include creating division within the wider jihadi movement, publicly snubbing Zawahiri and establishing a caliphate to which Isis demands every other jihadi swear fealty or face death. For more than a year both say they have worked behind the scenes, negotiating with Isis – including with Baghdadi himself – to bring the group back into the al-Qaida fold, to no avail. “Isis don’t respect anyone. They are ruining the wider jihadi movement and are against the whole <em>ummah</em> [Muslim nation],” Abu Qatada said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Isis are ruining the wider jihadi movement and are against the whole ummah</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Abu Qatada</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Isis has been sufficiently worried by the increasingly vehement criticism from Maqdisi and Abu Qatada to embark on a social media campaign against them – said to have been sanctioned by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/sep/23/islamic-state-followers-urged-to-launch-attacks-against-australians\">Abu Muhammad al-Adnani</a>, Isis’s chief propagandist. Isis social media accounts berate the two al-Qaida clerics as “stooges” of the west, part of a growing conspiracy against the caliphate. The sixth issue of Isis’s English-language magazine, Dabiq, featured a full-page picture of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada, labelled as “misleading scholars” who should be avoided more than the devil himself. “Qatada and I have been critical of them,” Maqdisi said. “They hate that.”</p> \n<p>The two ideologues make an odd pair in the fight against Isis. Qatada is 6ft 3in tall, broad shouldered and lumbering, while Maqdisi is rake thin and full of hyperactive energy, bounding round the room and speaking at double speed; at serious moments, Maqdisi is given to making a sudden joke or bursting into giggles. Sometimes they will go for walks with each other in the Jordanian countryside. More often they travel long distances by road after being asked to attend funerals of fallen al-Qaida fighters.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"663209251d0a90b051e5a1422d9a150216aac5c1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433954982833/1b7d66ce-79f0-4547-b570-f68f1f82bd4e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Abu &shy;Muhammed al-Maqdisi, the intellectual godfather of al-Qaida\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu &shy;Muhammad al-Maqdisi, the intellectual godfather of al-Qaida.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mustafa Khalili</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maqdisi’s notoriety has ensured that he has spent most of the past two decades in and out of jail. (He claims to have been subject to torture – which is indeed widespread in Jordanian prisons; pulling the hairs out of a radical’s beard, he said, is one favoured method of inflicting pain.) It is widely believed that the Jordanians released him again this February because they realised, with Isis rampaging across the region, that his stature made him a valuable ally in the struggle against the militant group.</p> \n<p>But Maqdisi and Qatada have looked on as Isis’s young radicals rampage from victory to victory – cursing, mocking and betraying the old guard as they go, while al-Qaida, largely guided by veterans of the Afghan era, has been brought to its knees in this jihadi civil war.</p> \n<p>As Qatada poured tea into small glass tumblers, he began reeling off images to better communicate the depth of his loathing for Isis. He likes speaking in metaphors. The group, he said, was “like a bad smell” that has polluted the radical Islamic environment. No, they were better described as a “cancerous growth” within the jihadi movement – or, he continued, like the diseased branch of a fig tree that needs to be pruned before it kills the entire organism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2014/dec/18/-sp-the-race-to-save-peter-kassig\">The race to save Peter Kassig | Ali Younes, Shiv Malik, Spencer Ackerman and Mustafa Khalili</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Qatada, who was once described by the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2009/feb/19/abu-qatada-compensation-european-court\">British Special Immigration Appeals Commission</a> as a “truly dangerous individual … at the centre of terrorist activities associated with al‑Qaida”, has a strained, high-pitched voice, like an alto<strong> </strong>version of Marlon Brando in The Godfather; he speaks slowly, pausing for effect. His broad frame easily filled one of the throne-like Louis-XIV-style armchairs that line his reception room. Comfortably ensconced, he turned to yet another metaphor to describe how Isis has recruited a generation of young Muslims who barely remember the 9/11 attacks. “You go to a restaurant and they present to you this beautiful meal. It looks so delicious and tempting. But then you go into the kitchen and you see the dirt and the filth and you’re disgusted.”</p> \n<p>Both men are particularly appalled, they said, by the way Isis has used their scholarship to cloak its savagery in ideological legitimacy, to gain recruits and justify its battle with al-Qaida and its affiliates. “Isis took all our religious works,” Maqdisi said. “They took it from us – it’s all our writings, they are all our books, our thoughts.” Now, Abu Qatada said, “they don’t respect anyone”.</p> \n<p>Such impudent behaviour, the two men agreed, would never have been accepted in the days when Bin Laden was alive. “No one used to speak against him,” Maqdisi lamented. “Bin Laden was a star. He had special charisma.” But despite their personal affection for his successor, Zawahiri – whom they call “Dr Ayman” – they both admit that he does not possess the authority and control to rebuff the threat from Isis. From the “very beginning” of his tenure, Zawahiri lacked “direct military or operational control,” Qatada said. “He has become accustomed to operating in this decentralised way – he is isolated.”</p> \n<p>According to Maqdisi, al-Qaida’s organisational structure has “collapsed”. Zawahiri, Maqdisi said, “operates solely based on allegiance. There is no organisational structure. There is only communication channels, and loyalty.” And unfortunately for Zawahiri, Isis has done its utmost to ensure that loyalty is in short supply.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b94c36795472c4cca782521cb4c0e386af441d86\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433955365256/431b41f8-7b11-4207-ae6b-986dc5dae338-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The radical cleric Abu Qatada says Isis is a 'cancerous growth' within the jihadi movement.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The radical cleric Abu Qatada says Isis is a ‘cancerous growth’ within the jihadi movement.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mustafa Khalili</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dr Munif Samara – a veteran of the jihad in Afghanistan and a close associate of Maqdisi and Qatada, who sat with both men as they were interviewed – painted an even more gloomy picture of al-Qaida’s position. A GP who runs a free clinic treating injured Syrian fighters and civilians, Samara has more experience than Maqdisi or Qatada with the day-to-day operations of jihadi organising, and has often handled the affairs of the two men during their frequent jail stints. He said that donations, which once came in waves of “hundreds of thousands”, have dried up as donors directed their money to Isis, or else refused to fund further bloodletting between the two groups. Another former al-Qaida member, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/05/former-al-qaida-spy-for-mi6-urges-effort-to-confuse-islamic-state\">Aimen Dean</a> – who defected to become a spy for British intelligence – told the Guardian that one of his sources in Pakistan’s tribal areas said the finances of al-Qaida central in Waziristan were so desperate that it was reduced at one point last year to selling its laptops and cars to buy food and pay rent.</p> \n<p>Samara described Isis’s fight against al-Qaida as an attempt to bring the older group down from within. “At this moment, we do believe there is a coup d’etat under way within al-Qaida itself,” he said. </p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>In the decade after 9/11,</strong> al-Qaida attracted money, initiates and prestige like no other jihadi group in history. It grew to command the loyalty of a wide network of terrorist branches and affiliates that stretched from Europe to Africa and South Asia. Never before had so many geographically disparate groups been united under one banner. Bin Laden achieved this feat, at least in part, by remaining ideologically flexible. He refused to be proscriptive on small matters of faith, avoiding the kind of disputes that had ripped apart other jihadi coalitions in the past. In keeping with its formal name – <em>Tandheem Qaidat al-Jihad</em>, The Organisation for the Base of Jihad – al-Qaida acted as a hub for militants to make connections and receive financial and organisational support. Regional commanders were entrusted with a great deal of operational freedom.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The finances of al-Qaida were so desperate that it was reduced to selling its laptops and cars to buy food and pay rent</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In return, al-Qaida’s leadership demanded one thing above all else: loyalty. Its commanders were strictly vetted before being appointed; only those known from the battlefields of Afghanistan, Bosnia or Chechnya – and deemed to have the requisite knowledge of Islamic scholarship – were elevated to the group’s upper echelons. On their appointment, these senior commanders swore a blood oath to Bin Laden himself.</p> \n<p>When Zawahiri took over after Bin Laden’s death in 2011, he found himself geographically isolated. While he was hiding out, according to numerous sources, in the mountains on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, the centre of jihadi activity had moved thousands of miles away, to Syria and Iraq. As Pakistan’s army and American drones tightened their net around al-Qaida central, it became harder and harder for Zawahiri to maintain contact with his commanders in the field. “What is leadership,” Samara asked, “if your leader is in Afghanistan and your soldiers are in Iraq?”</p> \n<p>In fact, al-Qaida’s main branch in the Middle East, the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI), had long been a source of difficulty. Since its effective creation in 2003, under the leadership of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, ISI had been happy to use al-Qaida’s brand name and its money, but often ignored pleas for closer communication with central command – even when they came from Bin Laden himself. In 2010, they crossed a line: ISI appointed a new leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, without prior approval from al-Qaida, whose senior leaders knew almost nothing about the man – where he had come from, his military experience, whether he could be trusted.</p> \n<p>In a revealing communique seized during the raid on Bin Laden’s hideaway in Abbottabad, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/23/adam-gadahn-drone-strike-al-qaida\">Adam Gadahn</a> – the American al-Qaida member and frequent spokesman – voiced his disgust with ISI’s lack of respect. Writing to Bin Laden in January 2011, he asked why ISI should be permitted to sully al-Qaida’s name with its indiscriminate slaughter when it could not even bother to keep in touch with the group’s leadership. “Maybe,” he wrote, “it is better for them not to be in the ranks of the mujahideen, as they are just like a polluted spot that should be removed and sanitised and cleared from the ranks.” Less than six months after receiving the letter, Bin Laden was dead. Now it fell to Zawahiri, a man of lesser standing, to deal with the problem.</p> \n<p>By this time, ISI had been pushed to the brink of collapse by US and Iraqi forces – but the Syrian civil war gave the group a chance to rebuild. As the conflict began to intensify, Baghdadi quietly dispatched one of his junior officers, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jun/16/isis-islamic-state-iraq-levant-q-and-a\">Abu Muhammad al-Joulani</a>, across the border in late 2011 to take advantage of the chaos. Equipped with funds, weapons, and some of ISI’s best soldiers, Joulani’s group – which would soon be known as the Nusra Front – quickly became the most formidable fighting force in Syria. By 2013, Joulani was such a powerful commander in his own right that Baghdadi feared he was on the verge of obtaining Zawahiri’s support to elevate himself as the leader of an independent al-Qaida branch in Syria.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"12742ab2e9b4c3a209856df168d23ec66b07e61b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433955535275/2d5aba52-7200-44d6-90ed-731ff75171c1-351x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, has struggled to assert his authority from his hideout in Waziristan.\" width=\"351\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ayman al-Zawahiri, the leader of al-Qaida, has struggled to assert his authority from his hideout in Waziristan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On 8 April 2013, Baghdadi launched a pre-emptive strike – whose consequences would rip apart the banner of unity that had long presided over the jihadi movement. In an audio recording released online, Baghdadi declared that the Nusra Front and ISI would officially become one organisation. Nusra’s battle-stained banners, which hung over their newly captured headquarters in Syrian cities such as Raqqa, Aleppo and Homs would be replaced. The merged organisation would be called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or more simply Isis. The rebrand was effective immediately. Two days later, Joulani replied with his own audio message. He rejected Baghdadi’s “invitation” to merge – and pledged an oath of loyalty directly to Zawahiri, appealing to the “sheikh of jihad” to resolve the dispute.</p> \n<p>Within 24 hours, Zawahiri dispatched a private message urging calm. He said he wanted both commanders to send him representations before he would rule on this spat, which had, thanks to the internet, become embarrassingly public. Baghdadi made it clear that he was not willing to compromise: in a personal message, he warned Zawahiri that any hint of support for the “traitor” would have “no cure except the spilling of more blood”.</p> \n<p>On 23 May, Zawahiri delivered his verdict: Isis, which had been created without prior approval, would have to be “dissolved”; Baghdadi was ordered to restrict his operations to Iraq. Meanwhile, his former junior, Joulani, would become the leader of al-Qaida’s official branch in Syria. Both men, Zawahiri added, had a year to prove themselves, after which al-Qaida central would decide on what measures to take next. Like any suspended sentence, it was both an offer of redemption and a threat: Baghdadi could prosper by playing nicely within the new rules, or lose his position within al-Qaida entirely. Finally, to ensure his accord was adhered to peacefully, Zawahiri dispatched an emissary, Abu Khalid al-Suri, in whom he vested the power to resolve any further disputes.</p> \n<p>One former senior member of ISI who did not want to be named told the Guardian that Baghdadi was incensed by Zawahiri’s letter: he was shocked to be treated as an equal to Joulani and ordered to stay out of the Syrian conflict into which he had invested so much. According to Maqdisi, Baghdadi contemptuously dismissed Zawahiri’s envoy. “Suri told Baghdadi, if you stick to these points and you go back to Iraq, I will not make this order public,” Maqdisi said. “Instead, Isis refused the orders, and then started attacking Zawahiri – saying, ‘Al-Qaida is gone, it’s burned out.’”</p> \n<p>After Suri made good on the threat to go public with Zawahiri’s humiliating diktat – which was released to al-Jazeera in June – Baghdadi issued his own blunt and unbending reply: “As long as we have a pulse or an eye that blinks,” he said, Isis was there to stay. It was the first time a major al-Qaida figure had ever publicly defied the organisation’s leader. “That was an alarm bell,” Abu Qatada recalled.</p> \n<p>That summer, Isis began preparing for war: swelling its ranks and readying itself to claim back Syrian territory from Nusra, which it believed was rightly its own. In an astonishing series of prison breaks, it freed hundreds of Iraq’s most dangerous inmates by firing mortar rounds at walls and using car bombs to blow apart entrances. According to secret documents recently obtained by <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/islamic-state-files-show-structure-of-islamist-terror-group-a-1029274.html\">Der Spiegel</a>, Isis also began implementing plans to take advantage of the stream of thousands of men who were flooding into Syria from Tunisia, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Europe. Without ties to native Syrians, these foreign fighters were likely to remain loyal. And they needed to be loyal, because instead of fighting Assad – as they had come to Syria to do – they would be used to stab the homegrown anti-Assad rebel groups in the back.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>One of Maqdisi’s close associates in Jordan</strong> is a man who we will call Raheem, a personal aide to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi who helped found the organisation that evolved into Isis – and who had an inside view of the group’s transformation after Baghdadi took power. A hulking figure, standing at more than 6ft 4in, he appeared suddenly one day at Maqdisi’s house, after hearing a rumour that Isis followers had assaulted his sheikh. In an interview a few weeks later, Raheem described the men running Isis as a different breed from the religiously inspired jihadis of al-Qaida; in fact, he said, the group had been run for several years by men who once served Saddam Hussein’s Ba’athist regime.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-448244984__\n</div> \n<p>According to Raheem, when Zarqawi was in charge, it was his unofficial policy to shut out anyone from the secular nationalist Ba’ath party. Zarqawi firmly believed that Iraqis in general, and Ba’athists in particular, lacked piety. Under Hussein, Iraq had been a secular state, and Islamism – the body of intellectual work that has turned Islam from a religion into a full-blown system of governance – had been brutally suppressed. “There were very few Iraqis who were exposed to other ideas,” Raheem said. “They were nationalists and were highly influenced by the Ba’ath.”</p> \n<p>After Zarqawi’s death in 2006, ISI was almost destroyed by US forces and Sunni tribes revolting against its brutal violence. To save themselves, Raheem said, ISI’s inner circle decided that the group needed to broaden its ranks: revolutionary Islamist credentials were no longer essential – if you could recite a few lines of the Qur’an and grow a beard, you could sign up. The former Ba’athists, who had run Iraq for decades, were invaluable new recruits: Hussein’s former military officers knew the vulnerabilities of the Iraqi army; his former intelligence officials knew the power brokers in each town and village. Since the regime’s overthrow, these men had lost their incomes and their authority; now the Islamic State of Iraq would serve as a vehicle for them to regain their status. (Documents obtained by <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/islamic-state-files-show-structure-of-islamist-terror-group-a-1029274.html\">Der Spiegel</a> have revealed the major role played by a former colonel in Hussein’s air intelligence service, known as Haji Bakr, who is said to have been the architect of Isis’s takeover of northern Syria; according to Raheem, he brought an entire Ba’athist unit with him when he joined the group.)</p> \n<p>Raheem alleged that it was largely these men – former Ba’athists who became senior members of ISI – who nominated Baghdadi as the organisation’s new leader in 2010. Until his appointment, Raheem said, Baghdadi was regarded as a minor figure, quiet and uncharismatic. He had no military experience, and his scholarship was of little note, though he held a PhD in Islamic studies. But he made the ideal front man: on paper, at least, he was a religious scholar; his family claimed to be descended from the prophet Muhammad; and most importantly of all, he was not himself a Ba’athist.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/11/-sp-isis-the-inside-story\">Isis: the inside story | Martin Chulov</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After Baghdadi’s appointment, ISI’s inner circle closed ranks around its chosen leader. It discontinued all but the most cursory communication with al-Qaida central, and slowly, the few remaining senior figures considered loyal to Zawahiri were either deliberately sidelined or killed off on the battlefield. By the time Zawahiri’s fateful letter arrived in May 2013, Raheem said, there was not a single person in Isis’s senior leadership who had once belonged to al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>Later that year, while the rest of the world was fixated on Assad’s chemical weapons, Isis planned to seize control of the 500-mile border between Turkey and Syria: if it could hold the border crossings, which supplied the main rebel groups with food, medicine, weapons and new recruits, Isis would have Nusra and its other rivals by the throat. By December, strategically important border towns began to fall, one by one, to Isis fighters. Isis fighters rode into towns whose freedom from Assad had been won at great cost, stripped factories bare, and turfed out – or killed – other fighters and their families. They kidnapped high-level commanders from other rebel groups, and murdered Syrian civilians who had been involved in the earliest mass protests against Assad, calculating that these were the only people brave enough to confront Isis in the future.</p> \n<p>In December 2013, Hussein Suleiman, a handsome young physician who was also a senior officer of the Islamic Front rebel group, was sent to make peace with a local Isis unit after trouble broke out at a checkpoint near Lake Assad in eastern Syria. When Suleiman did not return to base, Islamic Front officials contacted Isis, which confirmed they were holding him prisoner as a spy. Outraged, the Islamic Front demanded his release. Surely Isis could not go around arresting peace brokers? At the very least, they asked that his crimes be tried in an independent sharia court. Isis refused.</p> \n<p>When Isis released Suleiman as part of a prisoner exchange on 31 December, the Islamic Front received a mutilated corpse: his right ear had been cut off, his teeth were knocked out, one of his legs had been broken. The young doctor had been tortured, and the top of his head was blown off. The next day, the Islamic Front posted pictures of his mangled body online, next to those of how he used to look. They spread rapidly on social media and sparked protests in towns across Syria against Isis brutality. In Isis-controlled towns, fighters shot at the protesters, fuelling more outrage.</p> \n<p>Within days, Syria’s major rebel groups – including Nusra, the country’s al-Qaida affiliate – banded together to declare war on Isis. Thousands of militants were killed over the first few months of 2014, as battles raged between Isis and the other rebel factions, with senior commanders on both sides kidnapped, tortured and murdered. As their positions were overrun, Isis was forced to retreat from western Syria. It began consolidating its control over the east, the area closest to Iraq, and the location of many of Syria’s oil fields. There, Nusra and Isis fought viciously, in and around the city of Raqqa and along the banks of the Euphrates.</p> \n<p>On 16 January 2014, Zawahiri’s envoy, Abu Khalid al-Suri, published a message online. He tweeted that Isis was seeking to corrupt the jihad as it had done in Iraq: militants should direct their bombs at the infidels, he declared, not at their fellow jihadis. Seventeen days later, Zawahiri played his final card: Isis was expelled from al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>For Isis, there was no turning back. To make clear that reconciliation was off the table, they sent their former boss a message that he would not forget. On 21 February, five men fought their way into the compound in Aleppo where Suri was staying. When their target appeared, one of the attackers detonated his suicide vest. Zawahiri’s loyal servant, who had been sent from Afghanistan to make peace, now lay dead.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>From their jail cells in Jordan,</strong> Abu Qatada and Maqdisi watched the vicious struggle between Isis and al-Qaida with growing concern. For Abu Qatada, it felt like history was repeating itself. In the early 1990s, he had been a fervent supporter of the Algerian Groupe Islamique Arm&eacute; (GIA) – issuing fatwas that gave GIA terrorists license to kill with little discrimination. But when the GIA inevitably began murdering rival militants, Abu Qatada assembled a group of radical scholars to denounce the organisation, helping to strip it of intellectual credibility among fellow jihadis. Now, more than 20 years later, he wanted Maqdisi to join him in a similar campaign against Isis – to publicly shame the group as extremists acting outside the accepted rules of jihad.</p> \n<p>Maqdisi asked Abu Qatada to hold off. He still hoped that Isis could be brought back within the fold. Some of Isis’s most senior members had already written to him in prison signalling their contrition. One letter said: “We know that we have made mistakes … We know that among our soldiers and clerics there are some who are extremists … But they are the minority.” (It was signed: “Your son, one of the sharia legislators for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria written by request and on behalf of some of his brothers.”) With the right plan for reconciliation, Maqdisi believed that unity might be restored.</p> \n<p>Using intermediaries to keep Zawahiri informed of his attempts at arbitration, Maqdisi reached out to Isis’s inner circle in late 2013, approaching one of his former students, a young Bahraini named Turki Binali. Binali had been his protege – a pupil of “extraordinary passion”, in Maqdisi’s words. Some nicknamed him “Maqdisi junior”. After joining Isis, Binali rapidly rose into its highest ranks: he was appointed as Baghdadi’s official biographer, and by spring 2014, he had been named Isis’s chief “scholar at arms”.<strong> </strong>In theory, a single decree from Binali’s pen could end the civil war between Isis and al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>Maqdisi, who dispatched two of his own students to meet Binali in person, said that their initial exchanges were encouraging: he warned Binali that unless Isis was willing to negotiate an end to the conflict with al-Qaida, the group risked condemnation from the world’s most eminent jihadi sheikhs. In response, Binali assured his “beloved teacher” that Baghdadi wanted nothing more than to reach agreement with al-Qaida. But as months passed, and the fighting continued, Maqdisi came to believe Binali had little intention of settling the feud.</p> \n<p>How, Binali asked Maqdisi, could Zawahiri have praised the Arab Spring when the people who had risen up in Egypt and elsewhere were calling for democracy, not sharia? Why, he asked, did Zawahiri refer respectfully to the US president as “Mr Obama”? Perhaps, Binali intimated, al-Qaida had decided to quit the jihad and settle into a quieter existence as a peaceful organisation? Maqdisi thought these questions were “absurd”, he said – “meaningless, insignificant points”, which Isis had “never mentioned in the past”.</p> \n<p>By spring 2014, communications between student and teacher had seriously deteriorated; at one point, Binali slighted Maqdisi by suggesting that old age had confused him. After drafting a short online article entitled “My former Sheikh”, Binali stopped replying altogether. On 26 May 2014, Maqdisi deemed the negotiations dead and, backed by his fellow al-Qaida ideologues, issued a fatwa against Isis.</p> \n<p>“It has become necessary that we tell the truth, after we exhausted all the possibilities of advice and all hopes of making Isis return to the path of truth,” Maqdisi wrote. The rebellious organisation, he declared, had no “Islamic pretext”. Baghdadi, his commanders, and their religious officials were “deviants” who had “disobeyed the orders of their leaders and head scholars”. He instructed Isis’s soldiers to defect to the Nusra Front, and decreed that no Islamic website should host Isis messages.</p> \n<p>This was a serious threat to Isis’s legitimacy, and even its future. According to a series of detailed leaks from an anonymous Twitter account – much of which the Guardian has subsequently verified – Binali approached Baghdadi with a stark appraisal of Isis’s vulnerable position. The caliphate would eventually collapse, he said, if the jihad’s leading scholars and veterans continued to stand against Isis. The project could not be sustained unless Isis recruited influential supporters.</p> \n<p>Binali’s solution to this problem was simple: if Isis could not win support, it would buy it. In the summer and autumn of 2014, messages were sent to Maqdisi, Abu Qatada and about a dozen other top-ranking clerics, inviting them to relocate to the caliphate, where they could work without fear of imprisonment. (Baghdadi even wrote a personal letter to Maqdisi to persuade him to come). To sweeten the deal, payments of up to $1m were promised. Binali also sent word to al-Qaida’s branch in Yemen that Isis would offer its leader and his men $10m to publicly pledge allegiance to Baghdadi; a similar offer, for $5m, was made to the al-Qaida affiliate in Libya.</p> \n<p>Binali’s scheme had mixed results. Maqdisi, Qatada and the other prominent scholars rejected the offer out of hand, as did Yemen’s al-Qaida commander. But Binali appeared to have captured the interest of several jihadi factions across the globe. In November, Isis trumpeted public oaths of loyalty from jihadi militants in Egypt, Libya, Pakistan and even Yemen, al-Qaida’s strongest redoubt. Suddenly, the group’s influence was extending beyond Syria and Iraq, into the rest of the Islamic world.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"fd752b6156d8a2366c39079837bbe6f4a1d2c25e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433962970179/55b3457c-d644-440a-abed-cc8a3e9945d7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dr Munif Samara\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Munif Samara, the jihadi doctor and close associate of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mustafa Khalili</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There would be other exchanges between Maqdisi and Binali later that year, including a failed attempt to secure the release of the Isis hostage Peter Kassig. Their final communication came not long after Kassig’s execution, when Maqdisi once again found himself mediating with Isis. On 24 December 2014, a Jordanian military aircraft was shot down over Isis territory near the northern Syrian city of Raqqa, and its pilot taken hostage; Maqdisi heard the news when the prison imam dedicated a prayer to the man. Soon after, Maqdisi sounded out Jordanian officials about an idea, originally suggested by his friend Dr Munif Samara, to secure the return of the pilot. Although Jordanian officials were wary, believing that the pilot could have been killed already, they authorised the plan.</p> \n<p>Communicating primarily via Telegram messenger, an app that allows for encrypted communications, Maqdisi sent word to Isis in January of this year that the Jordanians would be willing to conduct a prisoner swap: in return for the pilot, they would release a woman named Sajida al-Rishawi. In 2005, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi had sent al-Rishawi and her husband on a mission to Jordan, where they were to explode bomb belts at the Radisson SAS hotel as part of a coordinated series of suicide bombings. Rishawi’s device did not detonate, and she was arrested, languishing on death row for the next decade. In his approach to Isis, Maqdisi said, he reminded the group’s senior leaders that, as the inheritors of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi’s legacy, they had an obligation to save her now.</p> \n<p>Although Maqdisi is not certain about who he was communicating with, he has no doubt that his messages were being relayed to the most senior members of Isis, including Baghdadi himself. The initial response was positive: Maqdisi says he was told that Isis were “eager” to make the trade. On social media, Isis supporters suddenly began calling for al-Rishawi’s release.</p> \n<p>Before any deal could be brokered, the Jordanians instructed Maqdisi to obtain proof that the pilot was still alive. In response, the Isis negotiators sent Maqdisi an electronic file that they claimed would provide proof of life – but the file was password protected.</p> \n<p>On 3 February, after a few days of tense dialogue, the negotiators finally sent Maqdisi the password to unlock the file. When he received it, Maqdisi realised he had been betrayed: the password, in Arabic, was “Maqdisi the pimp, the sole of the tyrant’s shoe, son of the English whore.”</p> \n<p>After he typed it in, one humiliating character at a time, a video appeared on Maqdisi’s screen. He watched in horror as Isis soldiers muscled the pilot into a cage, doused him in petrol, and burned him alive. Three hours later, Isis posted the video on the internet. The next day, Sajida al-Rishawi was taken from her cell and executed.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>At his house on the outskirts of Zarqa,</strong> about 25km from Amman, Maqdisi keeps a large model boat on top of one of his overstuffed bookshelves. It’s a strange object to find there: Islamic extremists are not known for their maritime collectibles. The boat was a gift from a very senior member of Isis, who built it from pencils and matchsticks while incarcerated in Abu Ghraib. Above the boat’s sails hangs a banner that reads “Journey with us,” a quotation from the Quranic retelling of the story of the flood, when Noah reaches out to beckon his son aboard. For Maqdisi, it is a symbol of salvation and unity. “It’s meant as a message for all Muslims,” he said – one with a special significance for jihadis today, as the factional bloodshed rages on.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b8b5dd34dc3a76c0d9e1da2d3cb724a209f2cf18\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433966118100/aa25bed4-770e-43b1-a47d-d497f67d7a28-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi's model ship made for him by a senior member of Isis who was incarcerated in Abu Ghraib\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abu &shy;Muhammad al-Maqdisi’s model boat was made for him by a very senior member of Isis, who built it from pencils and matchsticks while incarcerated in Abu Ghraib.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mustafa Khalili</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maqdisi and Abu Qatada continue to hope that the unity that once prevailed under bin Laden will return – but they admitted openly that Isis is winning the war on the ground and the propaganda struggle alike. “It’s a fluid state of affairs,” Abu Qatada suggested hopefully. “At the moment, Isis are drunk on power.” But at some point, he believes, they will need to negotiate with al-Qaida again. He pointed out that al-Qaida’s branch in Syria had achieved some recent successes against Assad’s forces, while Maqdisi observed that there were several other branches, including the one in Yemen, whose allegiance remains unquestioned. “Its loyalty is strong and clear,” Maqdisi said. “When Zawahiri sends a message to Yemen, he knows his orders will be obeyed.”</p> \n<p>But the two men believe that the events of the past decade – and especially the war with Isis – are a sign that al-Qaida needs to reappraise its tactics. Maqdisi believes that al-Qaida should no longer aim to recruit followers in large numbers; it needs “people of quality”, he said, who thoroughly understand Islamic scholarship, and will not merely deploy it in the furtherance of their own personal ends.</p> \n<p>In recent years, Maqdisi has even come to believe that al-Qaida’s conception of jihad – one licensed in part by his own scholarship – may have been incorrect, a jihad of “spite” rather than “empowering believers”. Even the attacks of 9/11, Maqdisi said, were part of a misguided strategy. “The actions in New York and Washington, no matter how great they appeared to be – the bottom line is they were spiteful.”</p> \n<p>Maqdisi now wants al-Qaida to begin providing social services, as Hamas has done in Gaza. “That kind of enabling jihad will establish our Islamic state. It will enable it to become a place of refuge for the weak,” he said. Al-Qaida branches in Tunisia and elsewhere have been putting this suggestion into practice – with jihadis guarding hospitals, building infrastructure, and even picking up litter. And yet, as one al-Qaida veteran who did not want to be named told the Guardian, local commanders have reported that their soldiers are impatient with these new duties; many would prefer for Zawahiri to swear allegiance to Baghdadi.</p> \n<p>Munif Samara, the jihadi doctor and close associate of Maqdisi and Abu Qatada, worried that al-Qaida may be crippled by its difficulty attracting new recruits. Young soldiers, he said, “want action, they want blood, they want explosions. They are sitting in their countries, and either they will be in jail or something like this, and they are waiting for al-Qaida [to do something], and al-Qaida is doing nothing.” For these young men, the lure of Isis is strong.</p> \n<p>Al-Qaida has long maintained that while the establishment of the caliphate is the ultimate goal, conditions are not yet right: ordinary Muslims need to be educated about “true Islam” for many more years before it can return. But it has now been a year since Baghdadi declared his own caliphate – and the longer that Isis can hold its territory and broadcast its military successes to the world, the more credibility it will steal from al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>As ideologues steeped in almost 1,400 years of Islamic scholarship, Maqdisi and Abu Qatada tend to the long view – for them, the proper perspective on al-Qaida’s present crisis is one of decades rather than months, which may explain their relative optimism about its possibility for renewal. For now, however, their fierce attacks on Isis have done little to halt its advances. Given the group’s ruthlessness and disdain for criticism, it is hard not to imagine, as one walks away from Maqdisi’s house, that if the war continues, it may not be long before he and Abu Qatada find themselves in the crosshairs.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Follow the Long Read on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\">@gdnlongread</a></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2219aaeecf8fe6a54772264c80a99531815c71ac/528_120_1701_1021/1701.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1021,"width":1701,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stringer . / Reuters/Reuters","altText":"Militant Islamic State fighters in a military parade in Syria’s northern Raqqa province","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Stringer . / Reuters/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433954984279/1b7d66ce-79f0-4547-b570-f68f1f82bd4e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Abu ­Muhammad al-Maqdisi, the intellectual godfather of al-Qaida.

The ongoing war between al-Qaida and Isis has left the US struggling to catch up with the tectonic shifts within the global jihadi movement, intelligence insiders told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Maqdisi, who Zawahiri counts as a close friend, is frank about the 63-year-old Egyptian’s situation. “He operates solely based on the allegiance. There is no organisational structure. There is only communication channels and loyalty,” Maqdisi said.</p> \n<p>Qatada, who was born Omar Mahmoud Othman and has been described by the British government as a “truly dangerous individual”, also says Zawahiri is “isolated” and admits that Isis have been winning the propaganda and ground war against al-Qaida.</p> \n<p>Qatada was deported from the UK to Jordan to face terror charges after a court battle lasting nearly 10 years with a series of British home secretaries. Last summer he was released from custody after being <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/sep/24/abu-qatada-cleared-terror-charges-jordan-court\">acquitted of all charges</a>. Since his release, he has become an increasingly vocal critic of Isis. He told the Guardian its members were extremists and a “cancer” growing within the jihadi movement following their assault on al-Qaida over the last two years. “[Isis] don’t respect anyone,” he said.</p> \n<p>Isis was al-Qaida’s branch in the heart of the Middle East until the group was excommunicated from the network in 2014 after disobeying commands from Zawahiri and starting an internecine war with fellow jihadists in Syria which left thousands dead on both sides. Today that fight continues and has expanded across Eurasia and the Mediterranean. Since declaring the establishment of its so-called Islamic State a year ago, Isis has gone on to build a global network of affiliates and branches that now stretches from Afghanistan to west Africa and competes with al-Qaida in its scale.</p> \n<p>Isis leaders, who described al-Qaida as a “drowned entity” in issue six of their official English-language publication, Dabiq, have declared that they will not tolerate any other jihadi group in territory where they are operating. They have readily delivered on that statement. Last week, Isis fighters in Afghanistan were <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/world/asia/afghanistan-taliban-face-insurgent-threat-from-isis.html\">reported to have beheaded 10 members</a> of the Taliban, and on Wednesday al-Qaida in Libya vowed retaliation after blaming Isis for the death of one of its leaders.</p> \n<p>But the US has been slow to grasp the implications of al-Qaida’s decline and possible collapse despite extensive study of Isis, according to intelligence community insiders. “There’s such a cadre of people so closely tied to the al-Qaida brand within the IC [intelligence community] that I think they don’t see what else is going on outside the organisation,” said Derek Harvey, a former intelligence analyst who predicted how resilient the Iraq insurgency would be.</p> \n<p>Over the past year, a group of junior and mid-level analysts have concluded that Isis advances have pushed al-Qaida to the margins of global jihad. A former senior intelligence official who did not want to speak on the record said they had been tracking the split between the two groups with great attention. Against them is what Harvey described as “the overwhelming majority of senior intelligence officials looking at this” who he said considered the enmity between Isis and al-Qaida as little more than “a squabble within”.</p> \n<p>That prevailing view has found expression in repeated public statements by Barack Obama and his senior advisers conflating Isis and al-Qaida or denying that any split between the two organisations is meaningful. That raises questions about whether a US counter-terrorism bureaucracy long focused on al-Qaida as a prime threat can grapple with the group’s decline and a different one’s ascent.</p> \n<p>In a typical comment, Barack Obama in March told Vice that Isis “is the direct outgrowth of al-Qaida in Iraq”. Although factually correct, this is substantively misleading: al-Qaida in Iraq was for 10 years al-Qaida’s most fractious and disloyal franchise, even before it began waging its violent campaign against the old guard.</p> \n<p>The US secretary of state, John Kerry, has depicted the rivalry between the two jihadi groups as cosmetic, and his top Iraq policy official, Brett McGurk, has repeatedly stated: “Isis is al-Qaida.” Kerry’s new spokesman, John Kirby, said in his old job at the Pentagon that Isis, al-Qaida and al-Qaida’s Syrian proxy the Nusra Front “in our minds, from our military perspective, are very much one and the same”.</p> \n<p>“We’ve got counter-terrorist guys who are focused on counter-terrorism and they grew up fighting the al-Qaida networks, but Isis is a different kind of network,” Harvey said. “It’s basing itself on skills and organisational capabilities and objectives that are much more accelerated and capable than what al-Qaida’s ever had.”</p> \n<p>However misleading, the conflation of the two groups has political and legal benefits for Obama. He launched military action against Isis without congressional approval 10 months ago and a push for retroactive legislative blessing is all but dead in Washington. Portraying al-Qaida and Isis as the same thing has allowed the president to claim that the 2001 and 2002 congressional authorisations for attacks on al-Qaida and Saddam Hussein provide the legal foundations for the current campaign.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the US continues to target al-Qaida. So far this year, according to <a href=\"https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/category/projects/drones/\">the Bureau of Investigative Journalism</a>, the Americans have launched 11 drone strikes in Yemen – the most recent came Tuesday night – and 11 more in Pakistan, killing between 82 and 122 people.</p> \n<p>US officials have warned that al-Qaida’s presence in Yemen, which al-Qaida’s scholars consider to be its most loyal branch, has benefited from the January coup that displaced the US client government and the Saudi-led war to roll it back.<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433961062698/0108f1fe-cd7f-422d-bdc1-ccb0a4ed8349-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"-/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Ayman al-Zawahiri","cleanCredit":"Photograph: -/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T21:30:04Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T23:45:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Spencer Ackerman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/4/1409842529387/Spencer-Ackerman-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/spencerackerman"},{"name":"Shiv Malik","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/shiv-malik"},{"name":"Ali Younes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ali-younes"},{"name":"Mustafa Khalili","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/mustafa-khalili"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Al-Qaida","Islamic State","World news","Middle East and North Africa","Ayman al-Zawahiri","Abu Qatada"],"tags":[{"id":"world/al-qaida","webTitle":"Al-Qaida"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/ayman-al-zawahiri","webTitle":"Ayman al-Zawahiri"},{"id":"world/abu-qatada","webTitle":"Abu Qatada"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/10/isis-onslaught-has-broken-al-qaida-its-spiritual-leaders-admit","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kna","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/10/isis-onslaught-has-broken-al-qaida-its-spiritual-leaders-admit","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/10/isis-onslaught-has-broken-al-qaida-its-spiritual-leaders-admit"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433961278030/89c80e12-76f4-4c4d-850b-0fc73198459b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ayman al-Zawahiri is isolated, scholars allied to him say.

The imam started to recite the pledge and we had to repeat after him: “We pledge our allegiance to the emir, that we would obey him and not rise up against him.” </p> \n<p>The second Friday, the imam said: “Caliph al-Baghdadi has set a deadline for Christians in Mosul to withdraw by Saturday afternoon. We asked their priests to come and discuss the tax they should pay to us, and they declined.” One of my Christian friends was a doctor and churchgoer. I asked him: “Why did your priests not go to the meeting with Isis?” He replied: “Our priests had a terrible experience with Isis in Syria. Two priests went to negotiate with them in Aleppo and they never came back. Quite simply, there is no trust.”</p> \n<p>Christians were given three choices: either convert to Islam or flee Mosul or get killed.

My hospital was also full of Isis militants who were monitoring all the wards and medical staff. The hospital began to run out of anaesthetics, which we were using primarily for Isis militants who get wounded during the battles. Some of the cleaners in the hospitals engaged with Isis to gain some authority, warning doctors who were not obeying the rules. One would shout that he would “smash your head with my shoes” if a doctor was late. All female dentists were prohibited from treating men and vice versa. I used to receive both sexes in hospital and my private clinic, but I was haunted by the nightmares of being lashed in public. I wrote a note and hung it on the door saying: “I examine men only.” </p> \n<p>Isis monitors in the hospital told me that being the only neurologist in the hospital, I was allowed to examine both sexes. I refused and insisted on getting a fatwa that guaranteed I would not be lashed. I was told there was no such fatwa. A few of my old female patients were begging me to examine them, but I apologised.</p> \n<p>I can’t forget when the only female anaesthetist in the hospital quit her job and we had women who needed caesarean operations, and we asked for the help of another hospital who sent us one of their male anaesthetists to save the lives of the patients. When the male anesthetist reached the hospital, the Isis monitor denied him access for being male. Two women died that night. </p> \n<p>I know a professor at Mosul University who was caught by the Isis <em>hisbah</em> (religious police) in a room with his female colleague correcting students’ final exams notes. The penalty was that he had to marry his female colleague or get 30 lashes. The professor refused as he already had a wife and children, and he accepted the lashes. </p> \n<p>I was with my wife in the car driving towards my parents house, and my wife had to take off her veil to breastfeed our little baby. The veil was keeping the blowing air off the baby, who was also terrified of her mother’s face being covered. Not that long after, an Isis <em>hisbah</em> patrol saw me and maintained that my wife should wear the veil under whatever circumstances, otherwise I would be in trouble.</p> \n<p>I left Mosul with my wife and two children recently and went to Irbil.</p> \n<h2>Basheer Aziz</h2> \n<p><strong>College graduate, 26, supports Isis</strong></p> \n<p>Mosul before Isis was like a grand, horrifying prison. It was a daily bet, who could make it to the first lecture in the morning, considering the long journey to the College of Sciences in Mosul, which was almost like travelling to another province. The bus had to stop by countless army checkpoints where there were feverish hunts for men’s IDs. Often, the whole bus would wait for an hour or two while a soldier was engaged in beating a passenger who happened to be not holding his ID.</p> \n<p>Islamic State is the dream and utmost desire of any Muslim. We longed to be governed by the holy Qur’an’s rules and the prophet Muhammad’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunnah\"><em>sunnah</em></a>. </p> \n<p>Now, with any call to prayer, all shops are shut down. Men have to grow their beards. Any act of adultery will be dealt with either by stones or lashes. The penalty of looting is a hand cut and men are imprisoned for publicly harassing women. </p> \n<p>Then Isis <em>diwans</em> (departments for health, complaints, preaching and mosques, education, almsgiving, <em>hisbah</em> and services) were established. The almsgiving department is in charge of collecting taxes to divide among needy families. Each family receives $25 a month, an amount that will be raised to $50 with the harvest season, in addition to a good portion of wheat, rice, sugar, pickles, food oil and fuels.</p> \n<p>The health department runs all hospitals in Mosul, Raqqa and Anbar and divides military medical staff and treatment among all fighting zones. Isis does not hire any doctor if he does not pledge his allegiance to Islamic State and never sends doctors to other provinces if they prefer to stay in their towns. </p> \n<p>Recently, an exclusive market for women was opened in Mosul to allow them to do their shopping at ease. There is no ban on women driving. The Isis municipality is doing its best to keep roads clean and paved, setting up lampposts, providing water and power and repairing the damage from coalition air strikes.</p> \n<p>I feel so proud being part of Isis, it granted me freedom. We live in glory now except for the coalition air strikes that spread panic and fear among the civilians. <br /></p> \n<p>I disagree with Isis practices against Christians, Yazidis and other minorities in Mosul. I’m still in touch with our Christian neighbours and wish they would come back shortly. All people in Mosul are in disagreement with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/feb/26/isis-fighters-destroy-ancient-artefacts-mosul-museum-iraq\">the demolition of ancient sites in Mosul</a>, and some Isis militants are not happy either. I discussed that with some of the young men of Mosul who joined Isis, and they said: “We did not know where these orders were coming from, the sharia court in Mosul was in astonishment too.” Amazingly enough, they told me that Isis is on its way to set up an archaeology department to excavate ancient sites in Mosul.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3844d80561a8a0b3e2f493f6c4c9bd0fc23f54c3\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3844d80561a8a0b3e2f493f6c4c9bd0fc23f54c3/0_37_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isis in Mosul\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People inspect a mosque destroyed by Isis militants in Mosul, in July 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is an acute financial crisis in Mosul now due to lack of jobs. Only those who receive monthly salaries from the government in Baghdad are surviving in Mosul. People do not know if Isis will last forever, or if another military organisation will come and exact revenge on those who were working for Isis. Depression is widespread among people of Mosul now. <br /></p> \n<p>At the same time, most of the people are against the return of the corrupt politicians or Shia militias who will destroy the city, not liberate it as they claim. Isis with all its brutality is more honest and merciful than the Shia government in Baghdad and its militias. <br /></p> \n<h2>Shaima Yousif</h2> \n<p><strong>Widow and mother of four, </strong><strong>33, </strong><strong>whose hand was chopped off for stealing</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/oct/27/citizens-mosul-iraq-economic-collapse-repression-isis-islamic-state\">Citizens of Mosul endure economic collapse and repression under Isis rule</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I did not have that much freedom to determine the pattern of my own life, coming from a middle-class family in one of the oldest districts in Mosul that is packed with people living in shabby little houses. My father, who had a grocery store in the neighbourhood where we used to live, thought school was good for my brother, Yasser, but not for me or my two sisters. “It is a waste of time and money,” my father told me once. I was hardly permitted to complete my primary school education, as my father was impatient to have me at home helping my mother with housework.</p> \n<p>A relative who used to work in a store for car repairs in Mosul city came to ask for my hand. The moment my eyes fell on him, I felt I could not live with such a man who looked almost like my father, being 10 years older than me. He seemed tough, rigid and uneducated. Simply speaking, he was not the man of my dreams. I told my father: “Sorry, I’m not in a hurry to get married.” My father’s response was: “I’m in a hurry, you are 18 now. I prefer you marry a man I get to know with a good income.”</p> \n<p>Last June, Isis took over Mosul and dominated the scene in the city. I advised Kareem, my husband, to leave his job and for us to flee together to Turkey. He was nearly convinced, but learned that he would be murdered soon if he did not assist Isis in repairing damaged vehicles left by the Iraqi army to use in their military operations.</p> \n<p>I will never forget the day when my husband rushed out early in the morning to a deserted military camp in the suburbs of Mosul to fix damaged military equipment belonging to Isis. He was killed by an air strike.</p> \n<p>Isis men kept coming to my husband’s parents’ house during the funeral in a pickup loaded with food for us and for the mourners. They also brought $300 in cash for the kids with a promise to keep sending $100 a month as a pension.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1831c8e625c8625eee4301fa55e0743390b046c6\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1831c8e625c8625eee4301fa55e0743390b046c6/912_1153_3567_2140/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mosul air strike\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smoke rises during air strikes targeting Islamic State militants at the Mosul Dam, in August 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khalid Mohammed/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I struggled to cope with my children’s daily demands. I sold my daughter’s bracelets at the jewellery shop, and went back the next day and slipped on a ring and walked out, hoping the owner would not recognise me with all the women wearing the veil. I walked out of the shop but the owner stopped me, and a woman from the Isis female security forces took me to their centre. </p> \n<p>“Why did you steal the ring?” an Isis interrogator asked me. I answered in tears, “I’m a widow of an Isis martyr with four children. I needed money to feed my children and pay the rent. Please forgive me.” </p> \n<p>I was questioned by two judges. The second day after my last hearing, I was taken from my room by three Isis women to another room where an old man was standing. He said: “Tie her to the table.”</p> \n<p>I was tied firmly, and another man came with a sword in his hand. When I saw him, I began to shout, “Mercy, have mercy on me.” I screamed and begged him to leave me alone. He looked so determined. I wanted to run away but couldn’t. I couldn’t believe the whole scene, and thought it was a nightmare. The man did not hesitate before chopping my left hand at the wrist. The whole world turned into black in my eyes and my legs were numb. No words in humanity’s dictionary can describe my pain and feeling at that horrifying moment. I fainted immediately. </p> \n<p>My eldest daughter wept all the time whenever her eyes met mine in the hospital. I was discharged and went home. I tried to commit suicide a few times by strangling myself but the image of my little children kept stopping me. I live now for them and have vowed to make sure they all finish their education and marry only the men they love.</p> \n<h2>Ghazwan Abdul Rahman</h2> \n<p><strong>High school graduate, 19, supports Isis</strong></p> \n<p>I was chatting with my friend about college when all of a sudden I received a hell of a push on my back. A towering man in Isis clothing was pushing aside any man obstructing his way towards the owner of the bakery. “I want some bread now, I can’t wait and need to go back to my other fighter brothers,” he said.</p> \n<p>But the owner told him to join the queue like the others. The argument heated up and the Isis fighter lost his patience, and directed a kick to the face of the owner, filled his bag with bread and dashed away after leaving some money on the table.</p> \n<p>We were all in an absolute silence watching without being able to say a word or do anything. The owner was bleeding from his nose. Two or three men ran to help and stop the bleeding while the owner vowed that he would complain to the sharia court. After two days, Isis police from the sharia court were in the bakery asking witnesses if the fighter or the owner provoked the situation and attacked first. All the men in the bakery confirmed that the fighter was the offender and the owner was merely trying to be fair and keep customers in queue. The sharia court verdict was in favour of the bakery owner and the Isis fighter had to apologise to him publicly. Then he was kicked out of the caliphate for his uncivilised behaviour.</p> \n<p>Isis succeeded in winning people’s hearts in Mosul from the first day they liberated the city for being modest, unprejudiced and cooperative. They restored the dignity and pride of the Sunni man in Mosul after enduring a great deal of humiliation and revenge under successive Shia governments since the US occupation of Iraq. </p> \n<p>Corruption was widespread and eroding all the city facilities, which were like a huge military barracks suffocating people. The city did not witness any reconstruction for the entire last 10 years despite all the billions that were poured into the city council. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c18b37d9cdaad0f3e3fbb4a30afcaf957e74cfe\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/7c18b37d9cdaad0f3e3fbb4a30afcaf957e74cfe/0_472_3155_1892/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isis in Mosul\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators chant pro-Isis slogans in front of the provincial government headquarters in Mosul, in June 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mosul now lives in a golden era. Though world media is in an effortless campaign to mar the image of Isis fighters, show them as brutal terrorists and monsters, on the contrary they are most welcomed in Mosul for the great sacrifices they have offered to protect Sunni people from the Shia army’s inhuman practices in Mosul and other Sunni provinces in Iraq. </p> \n<p>Isis locals and foreign fighters deserve all the love and respect by people in Mosul. Why is it all right for Shia militias in Iraq to have Lebanese, Iranian and Afghan fighters while it is unacceptable for us to have foreign fighters to defend us?</p> \n<p>Foreign fighters have integrated excellently within the Mosul community now, and have become a fundamental part of some families in Mosul. Lots of tribes in Mosul whose men joined the Isis army last year have accepted marriage offers by some foreign fighters as they prove to be most reliable and courageous. They are utterly untrue, all these stories about forced marriage by Isis foreign fighters to women in Mosul. </p> \n<p>None of the people in Mosul who pledged their allegiance to Caliph al-Baghdadi want Shia militias to get close to Mosul. I would be the first to fight these militias who come to sow destruction and killing among Sunnis. We have seen their atrocities in Tikrit and Jurf al-Sakher against isolated civilians. </p> \n<p>Mosul is more stable and safe now, my father can leave his shop open and go for prayers, and no one dares to steal a straw from the shop. Civil services are better now, like power and water, and roads are more clean. I spend most of my free time praying in mosques and attending courses in Islamic sharia and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadith\"><em>hadith</em></a>. </p> \n<h2>Hashim Zakei</h2> \n<p><strong>33, heavy smoker whose hand was cut off for stealing cigarettes </strong><br /></p> \n<p>The unavoidable three-year military service was the inevitable future for any confused student like me. I became more interested in learning cooking skills than military fitness and training. Serving officers and soldiers at least three meals a day, I was in the kitchen section all the time. Furthermore, I picked up a really dreadful habit, smoking heavily. </p> \n<p>After serving in the army, I purchased a wooden cart to sell hummus and bread. I was busy selling sandwiches to students after an extended school day when a <em>hisbah</em> patrol parked by my cart, checking everyone in the street including me. “Sir, I have nothing to hide, why are you searching me?” I asked. The man held the cigarette packet in his hand, and asked, “What about this?” I replied, “I’m sorry, I bought it for my old dad. As you know he is old, trying his best to quit.” On another day, I was busy setting up my cart with 10 cigarettes in my pocket, when a <em>hisbah</em> patrol came again to check the area. </p> \n<p>Tobacco smuggling in the city never stopped after the Isis takeover. One morning, I saw a vendor selling men socks on the floor, hiding cigarette packs underneath. The vendor began to run as soon as he saw a <em>hisbah</em> patrol coming towards him. Some of the men picked cigarettes out of the socks, others were firing in the direction of the fleeing vendor. </p> \n<p>I looked at the cigarette packs dispersed on the floor. I could not restrain myself from picking up five of them to put in my pockets. Within five minutes, <em>hisbah</em> militants were rounding me up as the intelligence man who spotted me was briefing them that I had stolen some of the cigarettes from the vendors.</p> \n<p>I was taken to sharia court. After a few questions, the judge said to me: “You are a thief, the court decided to cut your right hand by the wrist.”</p> \n<p>Before the judge would complete his words, I felt like being hit by an electric shock all over my body. I began to cry out with terror, begging the judge for mercy, that I have a family. The judge said: “Islamic sharia rules are beyond any discussion.”</p> \n<p>After three days I was taken by <em>hisbah</em> militants to a public park. My feet were tied to a wooden table as well as my left hand. An Isis man who was in a white Afghan dress holding a big sword said to me: “Do you want anything?” I said: “Mercy.” He said: “Anything else?” I said: “I’m the only breadwinner for my kids, please forgive me.” His answer was: “You shut up.”</p> \n<p>Immediately afterwards he turned fast to cut my hand and severed it off my arm. I was bleeding heavily. Once my eye fell on my chopped hand, I fainted.<br /></p> \n<p>When I regained consciousness, I found myself in an Isis hospital with Iraqi doctors. When I got home, my father received me weeping and said: “Thank God, it was only your hand.”</p> \n<p><em>All names of interviewees are pseudonyms. </em><em>Additional reporting by Kareem Shaheen</em></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/32b3324fc431007bbfa80989e227bc0a0108f323/0_72_3264_1959/3264.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1959,"width":3264,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"UNCREDITED/AP","altText":"Isis in Mosul","cleanCredit":"Photograph: UNCREDITED/AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e4f18beba9cda23e036baa18e50e05f8f298f5b2/0_204_4912_2946/4912.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2946,"width":4912,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Christians who fled violence in Mosul attend a mass in Irbil.

Back in the 670s, St Cuthbert declared the eiders of the Farne Islands should be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-23048394\" title=\"\">safe from predation</a> and, presumably, would-be quilt-makers.

Or how about the feral pigeon or herring gull – street-smart birds far more in keeping with modern Britain?</p> \n<p>But we’re stuck with the robin. True, it is embedded in our collective cultural memory, back to medieval times and perhaps beyond. In fact, we liked it so much that, up until the last century, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/earthnews/6867249/Robins-being-killed-and-eaten.html\" title=\"\">we used to eat it</a> – often in pies. Mark Cocker, in his wonderful <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2005/aug/20/featuresreviews.guardianreview4\" title=\"\">Birds Britannica</a>, waxes lyrical over a bird which got William Blake’s dander up: “A robin redbreast in a cage / puts all Heaven in a rage.” But Cocker also notes that the cheeky bird, which perches on my spade as I dig in the garden, has also long been considered a harbinger of death.

Every minute,” he says. “I don’t mean it was a horrible experience. But I’ve taken a big hit for nothing. The only good thing that’s come out of this are friendships ... But have I got anything else apart from looking at much of Ukip and thinking you are just a bunch of ragtag, unprofessional, embarrassing people who let Nigel down at every juncture? No.”</p> \n<p>The public feuding kicked off after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/11/nigel-farage-withdraws-resignation-as-ukip-leader\">Farage decided to “un-resign”</a>, going back on his promise to step down <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/video/2015/may/08/nigel-farage-resigns-ukip-south-thanet-general-election-video\">after he failed to win his target seat of South Thanet</a>. In the fallout, Kassam’s detractors accused him of being a divisive Iago-type figure, dripping rightwing poison into Farage’s ear that harmed the party’s chances of winning over moderate voters. According to his critics, it was Kassam’s “shock and awe” strategy that led Farage to warn against <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/oct/10/nigel-farage-keep-hiv-positive-migrants-out-britain\">foreigners with HIV</a> using the NHS and claim there were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/28/nigel-farage-eu-response-to-migrant-boat-crisis-would-bring-jihadis-to-uk\">half a million Islamist extremists among the migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2fd9f10a0ffb99e67d24cf1ac8932c15921a7923\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957831247/e8348b58-f79c-416e-9920-473d4765cf67-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Raheem Kassam.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Raheem Kassam.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Kassam denies this was ever his game plan – his theory is that people were jealous that he got too close to the Ukip leader, to the exclusion of almost every other acolyte. By polling day, it was obvious to those following the Ukip campaign that the inner court of King Nigel had shrunk to Kassam, election strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe and his Kent press officer Sarah White.</p> \n<p>“Egos got in the way at every point,” Kassam says. “Who do you think Nigel would call? It was always me. They absolutely hated that. But the truth of it was that we were always mopping up everyone’s messes.”</p> \n<p>We meet at the Blue Boar, a regular haunt in Westminster, and the supremely confident Kassam seems unfazed. He has just returned from a holiday in the US, is back at his old job at the rightwing news site <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/\">Breitbart</a> and is ready to lift the lid on some bizarre and dysfunctional happenings that dogged Ukip’s campaign. Over a drink, he’s keen to outline what went wrong. The confusion over whether Farage should back a cap on immigrants? “It created an impression of chaos. There is no way to look at it and think: ‘These guys really know what they are talking about.’” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/mar/24/janice-atkinson-expelled-ukip-false-expenses-claims\">The suspension of gaffe-prone Janice Atkinson</a> as an MEP for allegedly trying to inflate her expenses? “Nigel wanted her out before that. She should have gone when she said ‘<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/aug/18/ukip-mep-apology-thai-insult\">ting-tong</a>’.”</p> \n<p>The feuding between Farage’s personal team and officials at party HQ? “It was like a playground in there ... It got to the point where journalists would come into HQ and we’d have to lock certain doors because the people behind those doors were too embarrassing to be seen.” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/15/ukip-manifesto-2015-the-key-points\">The manifesto</a>? “It was a clusterfuck.” A particular party activist who remained in post despite a chequered history? “Disgraceful. The man is a racist, there is no doubt about it ... I don’t throw around racism often, I have a high threshold for it because I’m so anti-PC, but he is a definite racist.”</p> \n<p>Kassam says this was the only example of racism that he encountered during his time in the party and that he faced more prejudice when he was a member of the Conservative party. The most surreal moment? When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jan/20/ukip-health-party-rejects-nigel-farage-nhs-reform\">Louise Bours, the health spokeswoman, decided to resign in the middle of one of Farage’s rallies in a row over NHS spending</a>. “Afterwards, I had to lock everyone out of the room and tell Nigel. I can’t repeat what he said then.” She was later persuaded to stay and the episode never became public.</p> \n<p>He blames three senior Ukip figures for engineering his exit from the party and trying to orchestrate a coup against Farage – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/blog/live/2015/may/19/yvette-cooper-says-labour-sounded-anti-worker-for-people-in-big-firms-politics-live\">Patrick O’Flynn</a>, the former economics spokesman, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/26/ukips-evans-calls-for-cross-party-alliance-to-create-eu-referendum-no-campaign\">Suzanne Evans, the deputy chairman</a>, and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/douglas-carswell\">Douglas Carswell</a>, the party’s only MP. This is a charge they all deny, but O’Flynn was stripped of his frontbench role and Evans of her responsibility for policy in the aftermath of the row. Kassam reckons Carswell will survive just another six months in Ukip because he is no longer useful, given that the party has turned down almost &pound;1m of public funding<strong> </strong>due to him as an MP. “Douglas is not worth anything, he has no clout. He means nothing to us now,” he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b4c5434bf1e226f423ad25f5f80e9dca6f8e14d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957942036/7fecd095-a673-4458-8f07-c8545aa22f7f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Farage hears of his defeat in South Thanet on 8 May, with fellow contestants Will Scobie and Al Murray.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Farage hears of his defeat in South Thanet on 8 May, with fellow contestants Will Scobie and Al Murray.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On O’Flynn, he is equally scathing: “I’m sorry, but if you are Patrick O’Flynn and you have managed via your morning briefings to elicit a headline that says the EU is brainwashing our children through colouring books – OK, you tell me who is doing more damage to the party? And you know what the worst thing is? I went out to bat for those guys every time when they were in trouble.”</p> \n<p>Kassam claims that even before the election he could see a “plot” coming and warned Farage to no avail. “I predicted everything that would happen – the Suzanne stuff, the Carswell stuff, the Patrick stuff – nobody listened to me,” he says. “It earned me a lot of credit with Nigel that I foresaw that.”</p> \n<p>Not enough to keep him in the job, some might say, with the others still in the party. But Kassam claims he was not forced out of his role as Farage’s senior adviser, but instead chose to leave at the end of his contract in order to “bulletproof Nigel”.</p> \n<p>His argument goes like this: the anti-Farage camp believed the Ukip leader was veering too far to the right and had become too toxic to lead an EU referendum campaign that was now going to happen under a Cameron majority government. As Kassam’s critics lined up, painting him as a malign Tea Party influence on Farage, he says he was confronted with the choice of trying to brave out the row or resigning temporarily before returning as part of the leader’s Brussels staff. As it happened, Kassam was on the way to see his old boss at Breitbart in the US at the time, and was offered his former job back on the spot. He downed a shot of vodka, and then made his way to the Sky News studio to start defending Farage and attacking O’Flynn, including accusing him of having “personal problems” live on air.</p> \n<p>“In those situations it’s fight or flight. You can crumble or you can rise to the occasion. I was sitting there thinking: it’s fine. It’s just a job, I did my best. If I genuinely thought I’d let Nigel down in any way I would have been upset and distracted ... But basically I’ve formed a one-man human shield around Nigel. Every time they go for him, who will the journalists come to for background and quotes? I’m his forcefield at the moment. He knows it to be true to this minute.”</p> \n<p>Certainly, the whole episode has not dented Kassam’s loyalty to Farage, whom he describes as his “hero”. He claims they still speak regularly, most recently the day before – about the content of his speeches, social media and just general chat. Not coincidentally, Farage has also just signed up as Breitbart’s new star columnist. So why is he speaking out now, and would Farage be unhappy about what he has to say to the media? “Probably. But that’s my prerogative. “I think Nigel’s had a rough time, unfairly. And I’ve had a rough time, unfairly. That’s why.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72839876c8e68542a5c2c60aab90487075ad58db\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433958056798/95ef4dcb-211b-46ca-9d4f-8af8af80b556-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Douglas Carswell and Nigel Farage in happier times.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Douglas Carswell and Nigel Farage in happier times.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The 28-year-old son of Muslim immigrants who live in Uxbridge, Kassam might not seem the most likely choice to become friends with the leader of Ukip, but he has a history of working for rightwing websites and the <a href=\"http://henryjacksonsociety.org/\">Henry Jackson Society</a> thinktank. He says he first bonded with Farage when they met in the US and went on to have what is known in the Ukip lexicon as a number of “PFLs” – proper fucking lunches, defined by the number of bottles of wine that are consumed. After he was hired – despite warnings in the media about his “wild self-importance” – Kassam believes he became invaluable to Farage because he was one of the few people to stand up to him.</p> \n<p>During the last six weeks of the election campaign, Kassam was dispatched to the target constituency to take charge as it became clear the Tories were throwing in more resources. He immediately moved into Farage’s flat in Ramsgate, which became a place where there was a wine glass stuffed with cigarettes butts, an electricity meter that kept running out of credit and Farage’s bed was a mattress on the living room floor. “It looked like a Damien Hirst exhibition,” he says with pride.</p> \n<p>On a typical day, Farage would be up at 6am, bright and perky for a breakfast of kippers at a nearby hotel. “Then we’d rendezvous at the office and decide what we want to do for the day, which would involve some walkabouts and a lot of knocking on doors. Then we’d maybe hit a pub for lunch. Then more walkabouts and more canvassing. Then another pint around 5 o’clock, go out and do more evening canvassing. Then around 9, we’d go to The Smugglers [pub] for dinner or we’d go to La Magnolia [an Italian] and have a nice civilised meal.”</p> \n<p>However, the entire Ukip team had failed to spot that Farage’s health difficulties – which led media commentators to note that the Ukip leader was tired and snappy at points in the campaign – were affecting his mood. “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/apr/24/nigel-farageukip-sleeping-pills-back-pain\">None of us realised he had back problems,</a>” he says. “That was his fault. We all saw the way he looked during the Believe in Britain speech. I thought: ‘We’d been for a steam three days running so you don’t look sweaty. But you’re still sweating and look really uncomfortable.’ I couldn’t understand it.”</p> \n<p>Farage finally spoke out about his agonising pain a few weeks before polling day, and decided to scale back his schedule and concentrate his time mostly on winning South Thanet. In the end, he lost by around 2,000 votes, having been convinced right up until the day itself that he was about to enter parliament on his seventh attempt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b9cce539edfa5da175e405c505421d3a71e9ee0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433958213759/5115718e-49ae-4e86-8a83-92382d583031-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Farage faces the media after defeat.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Farage faces the media after defeat.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“We knew by 10 o’clock that we hadn’t done it,” Kassam says. “That morning, Nigel and I went to vote together, and we were both in good spirits. I was quietly confident, I knew it was so close ... But suddenly between 12 and 4 there were queues in Broadstairs, and I thought: Oh no, these people are not voting for us ... It got to around eight and the queues in Broadstairs hadn’t subsided and everywhere else had. I said that’s it. I had tears in my eyes and I was genuinely holding back tears for the next 48 hours. I don’t cry, but I was so sad, so deeply sad.”</p> \n<p>While the results rolled in, Farage was asleep, while Kassam and Bruni-Lowe slept in 30-minute shifts to keep abreast of the news. In the morning, they accompanied Farage to the declaration, knowing that he had lost.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jun/10/raheem-kassam-ukip-nigel-farage-rag-tag-unprofessional-embarrassing-people\">Raheem Kassam: 'rag-tag, unprofessional, embarrassing people' spoilt Ukip's election</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Within an hour, Farage had resigned, and Kassam still insists that the Ukip leader was relieved to be going – despite famously unresigning just four days later. Kassam will also not hear any criticism of the South Thanet campaign itself, which he boldly declares to have been the “single best campaign ever, ever in British politics, bar maybe the Bradford spring”. If it were not for the SNP, he says, the party would have won around five more seats.</p> \n<p>Kassam also takes umbrage at the claims that he was responsible for Farage repeatedly bringing up the issue of immigrants with HIV using NHS resources. O’Flynn was fully onside, he says, and was present in the spin room after Farage’s television debate, ready to brief the press on the issue. He also disputes the idea that this in any way deterred potential voters.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think there was anyone who was thinking of voting for us who was put off by that,” he says. “Don’t forget Labour voters aren’t who you think they are. They aren’t sat in Hampstead sipping Chateau Neuf Du Pape.”</p> \n<p>Later on, Kassam returns to the theme. “Life is not a Michael Jackson song, you can’t heal the world,” he says. “I’d like to see any political party try and stand on that principle.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957755010/7d8c851e-c263-49c5-a48f-b0fc98c28cc5-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gareth Fuller","altText":"Kassam and Farage on the campaign trail on the eve of the election, 7 May.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gareth Fuller"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957832857/e8348b58-f79c-416e-9920-473d4765cf67-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Raheem Kassam.

On the one hand, it has made more people aware that gender is not as binary as many once believed. Yet discussions about transgenderism themselves are often conducted in harsh black and white. It has taken, of all unlikely folk, a member of the Kardashian clan to dropkick transgenderism into the mainstream. But amid all the carefully worded expressions of support for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/09/caitlyn-jenner-faces-new-lawsuit-over-fatal-car-crash\" title=\"\">Caitlyn Jenner </a>– previously known as Bruce – from President Obama to the Kardashians themselves, there is also dissent.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/02/caitlyn-jenner-transgender-response-vanity-fair\">Caitlyn Jenner: transgender community has mixed reactions to Vanity Fair reveal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Last weekend the New York Times published a piece by Elinor Burkett about her <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/opinion/sunday/what-makes-a-woman.html?_r=0\" title=\"\">qualms over elements of transgenderism</a>. Her main contention was with Jenner’s belief – and by extension, all transgender women’s belief – that she <em>feels</em> more female than male. “People who haven’t lived their whole lives as women shouldn’t get to define us. That’s something men have been doing for much too long … They haven’t travelled through the world as women and been shaped by all that this entails,” she wrote. Burkett’s piece split liberal opinion, with some expressing relief that someone had vocalised their own feelings on the matter, and others disgust that the New York Times had, as one prominent news website put it, “<a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2015/06/08/the_new_york_times_bungles_transgender_rights_what_its_caitlyn_jenner_op_ed_gets_wrong_about_feminism_and_gender_identity/\" title=\"\">bungled transgender rights</a>”. By and large the divide followed age lines, with those over 40 <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BetteMidler/status/607627409224003586\" title=\"\">taking Burkett’s side</a> and younger bloggers <a href=\"https://twitter.com/morninggloria/status/607977285216370688\" title=\"\">raging against her</a>.</p> \n<p>Burkett did bungle her argument. She compares a trans woman to a white man “using chemicals to change his skin pigmentation and crocheting his hair into twists, expecting to be embraced by the black community”. But comparing gender to race is a trope as tired as it is irrelevant. Her claim that “the insult and outright fear that trans men and women live with is all too familiar to [women]” is simply laughable. Second-wave feminists, of which Burkett is one, remember clearly the fights they led to liberate women from horrible constraints, and they did this so successfully that few women born after 1980 can imagine living under such constraints today. But at no point did western women endure the kind of&nbsp;marginalisation and <a href=\"https://www.glaad.org/tags/anti-transgender-violence\" title=\"\">risk of violence</a> and <a href=\"http://www.yspp.org/about_suicide/statistics.htm\" title=\"\">suicide</a> still suffered by so many trans people today.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It is a new world, that means questions will be asked, and that’s a good thing. It means people want to understand</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>If, as Burkett contends, a trans woman who has lived for most of their life as a man cannot understand what it feels like to be a woman, then a woman certainly has no idea what it feels like to be trans woman. And if a trans woman should not define what it means to be a woman, neither, really, should anyone as that path is paved with generalisations. Burkett’s list of sample experiences that make a woman (“the onset of their periods in the middle of a crowded subway”) is as reductive as the signifiers of femininity (cleavage and nail polish) Jenner references, which cause Burkett such rage. In any event, surely Jenner’s belief that she needs such accoutrements in order to look acceptably feminine could just as easily be cited as a near universal experience for women. As for the contention that trans women “undermine almost a century of hard-fought arguments that the very definition of female is a social construct that has subordinated us”, well, considering all that feminism has accomplished, I reckon it will probably survive Vanity Fair dressing up Caitlyn Jenner in a tight dress.</p> \n<p>But Burkett’s piece and the furore around it exemplify the problems in discussing trans issues. Among Burkett’s ultimately alienating rage and unhelpful analogies, she raises reasonable arguments, which is why her article struck a chord for so many. The mainstreaming of transgenderism is a new world, and that means questions will be asked, and that’s a good thing. It means people want to understand. What does Caitlyn Jenner, who became famous as an <a href=\"http://starcasm.net/archives/318494\" title=\"\">Olympic decathlete</a> – competing in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/golf/29242699\" title=\"\">an event from which women are still excluded</a> – mean when she says she always felt more like a woman?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/16/fallon-fox-trans-mma-athlete-interview\">Fallon Fox on life as a trans athlete: 'The scope of vitriol and anger was mind-blowing'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And speaking of sport, how to carve out a space for transgender athletes such as Fallon Fox, a trans woman who is a mixed martial arts athlete and fights against women – some of whom have complained that Fallon, having been born a man, has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/16/fallon-fox-trans-mma-athlete-interview\" title=\"\">an inherent physical advantage</a>? These are reasonable questions, but they are, in certain quarters, shouted down by accusations that the questioner is transphobic or a “terf” (trans-exclusionary radical feminist), which is why Burkett’s article felt to some like&nbsp;the release of a pressure valve, for all its faults.</p> \n<p>Some feminists, including Burkett, say that the rush to embrace transgenderism after so many years of exclusion has slammed down any room for debate. Arguments from the more extremist fringes have not helped, such as when the activist Martha Plimpton was widely criticised last year for using the word “vagina” about a benefit for Texas abortion funding. To reference female genitalia, Plimpton was told, is “exclusionary” because trans women are born without one. But these extremist wings, while loud, are no more representative of the wider trans movement than the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/08/04/woman-2\" title=\"\">radical feminist events</a> that explicitly exclude trans women are reflective of feminism. Just as the experience of the hugely privileged and near universally praised Caitlyn Jenner, for that matter, is hardly representative of that of the average trans person.</p> \n<p>Among all the talk of Jenner’s bravery, questions should still be asked. Because perhaps the biggest irony to debates about the trans movement is that, while they get bogged down too often in one-upmanship, academic posturing and hysteria, the growing acceptance of&nbsp;trans people themselves shows a realisation of an underlying truth: we&nbsp;are all just humans.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d09a2d9224826f54fa5174e0550df4820be230f4/160_0_4179_2508/4179.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2508,"width":4179,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Richard Levine/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"Caitlyn Jenner Vanity Fair cover","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Richard Levine/Demotix/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-11T05:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T05:00:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":664,"contributors":[{"name":"Hadley Freeman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733738532/HadleyFreeman.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/hadleyfreeman"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Transgender","Feminism","Caitlyn Jenner","Gender","Women","Life and style","UK news","World news","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"society/transgender","webTitle":"Transgender"},{"id":"world/feminism","webTitle":"Feminism"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/caitlyn-jenner","webTitle":"Caitlyn Jenner"},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Hadley Freeman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/hadleyfreeman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/11/caitlyn-jenner-transgender-feminism-woman","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kp7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/commentisfree/2015/jun/11/caitlyn-jenner-transgender-feminism-woman","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/11/caitlyn-jenner-transgender-feminism-woman"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d09a2d9224826f54fa5174e0550df4820be230f4/160_0_4179_2508/4179.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2508,"width":4179,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Feminism will probably survive Vanity Fair dressing up Caitlyn Jenner in a tight dress.’ Photograph: Richard Levine/Demotix/Corbis","credit":"Richard Levine/Demotix/Corbis","altText":"Caitlyn Jenner Vanity Fair cover","cleanCaption":"‘Feminism will probably survive Vanity Fair dressing up Caitlyn Jenner in a tight dress.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Richard Levine/Demotix/Corbis"}},"importance":1,"byline":{"title":"Hadley Freeman"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"cutout","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733738532/HadleyFreeman.png"}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-06-11T10:04:08Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/6aefcaf1-dbec-4058-a7b8-a925d4163831","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/6aefcaf1-dbec-4058-a7b8-a925d4163831"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"front"}
