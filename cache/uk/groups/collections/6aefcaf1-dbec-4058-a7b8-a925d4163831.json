(Prior to that the Folketing was the lower house of a bicameral parliament. This was amended following a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_constitutional_and_electoral_age_referendum,_1953\">constitutional referendum</a>.) The parliament has 179 members: 175 are elected in Denmark, two in the Faroe Island and two in Greenland.</p> \n<p>The country is divided into <a href=\"http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Democracy/Elections_and_referendums/General_elections/General_election_results.aspx\">10 multi-member constituencies</a> (which in turn are divided into districts). Each constituency is assigned a set number of seats. A total of 135 seats are distributed in proportion to the votes in each constituency. </p> \n<p>The other 40 seats are supplementary, and allotted to balance any difference between district-level results and the nationwide vote share. This is meant to ensure that the number of seats each party secures matches as closely as possible each party’s vote share, in accordance with Denmark’s constitution which requires not only regional representation but “equal representation of the various opinions of the electorate”.</p> \n<p>Simply put, if a party wins 20% of the vote it should have about 20% of the seats in parliament. </p> \n<p>There is a 2% threshold to enter parliament (unless a party wins a constituency seat, in which case it would enter parliament even if it hasn’t met the threshold. This is unlikely in practice as winning a constituency seat would most probably mean that a party has won more than 2% of the vote nationally).</p> \n<p>The threshold is low compared with most other countries. Germany, for example, has a 5% threshold, Sweden 4% and Turkey 10%. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94a2317384d0547abe63f7204b8395a02c541bb2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434447902446/ee7144d0-880f-4257-a59c-53bfbd742546-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Christiansborg Palace.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christiansborg Palace.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Fried / Alamy/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The political parties</strong></h2> \n<p>Denmark’s voting system makes it near impossible for a single party to win an outright majority. No party has won one <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danish_Folketing_election,_1903\">since 1903</a>. This means that governments in Denmark tend to be coalitions, often even minority alliances with parliamentary support from other parties. The constitution allows for a government to rule without winning a vote of confidence, as long as it doesn’t lose a no-confidence vote. </p> \n<p>Denmark has a lot of political parties in comparison with the UK, where a less representative electoral system is used. Broadly speaking the parties can be divided into two main blocs: a red bloc on the left of the political spectrum, and a blue bloc to the right of centre.</p> \n<p>The main parties in the red bloc are:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The Social Democrats (A), led by the incumbent prime minister, Helle Thorning-Schmidt.<br /></li> \n <li>Radikale, the Danish Social Liberal party (B). Leader: Morten &Oslash;stergaard.<br /></li> \n <li>The leftwing Socialist People’s party (F). Leader: Pia Olsen Dyhr.<br /></li> \n <li>The socialist Red-Green Alliance (&Oslash;).<br /></li> \n <li>The Alternative (&Aring;), a green party founded in 2013.<br /></li> \n</ul> \n<p>And in the blue bloc:</p> \n<ul> \n <li>The centre-right Venstre (V), currently the main opposition party. Led by Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen.<br /></li> \n <li>The rightwing Danish People’s party (O). Leader: Kristian Thulesen Dahl.<br /></li> \n <li>The Liberal Alliance (I). Leader: Anders Samuelsen.<br /></li> \n <li>The Conservative People’s party (C). Leader: S&oslash;ren Pape Poulsen.<br /></li> \n <li>The Christian Democrats (K). Leader: Stig Grenov.<br /></li> \n</ul> \n<h2><strong>The 2011 election</strong></h2> \n<p>At the last election, Venstre won the most votes (26.7%) and seats (47). However, the incumbent centre-right coalition lost power to the centre-left because the red bloc emerged as the larger of the two groups in parliament. It won 50.2% of the Danish vote, which translated into 89 seats against the blue bloc’s 86.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/danish-election-2011/giv-21277e4OsvWqGRDfJ/\" data-alt=\"Denmark 2011 election result\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/danish-election-2011/giv-21277e4OsvWqGRDfJ/\">Denmark 2011 election result</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Including seats from the Faroe Islands and Greenland, the final tally for the parties supporting the Social Democrat leader Thorning-Schmidt was 92 seats, while the parties backing the outgoing PM Lars L&oslash;kke Rasmussen secured 87. </p> \n<p>Thorning-Schmidt went on to form a minority coalition with the Social Liberal party and the Socialist People’s party and became Denmark’s first female prime minister. </p> \n<p>At the more recent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament_election,_2014_(Denmark)\">European parliament election</a>, in 2014, the People’s party won the most MEPs, followed by the Social Democrats and Venstre.</p> \n<h2><strong>The Danish electorate is highly engaged</strong></h2> \n<p>Denmark has one of the <a href=\"http://www.idea.int/vt/countryview.cfm?id=63\">highest levels of voter turnout in the world</a>.

All that hair, all that wealth and the obligatory trophy wife – he seemed like a natural part of the landscape of 80s Manhattan. So it is one of the weirder phenomena of my life that, 30 years on, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-presidential-speech-twitter-reaction\" title=\"\">Trump</a> is still, somehow, a presence when other figures from that era have long since faded away: junk bond king <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2006/oct/24/4\" title=\"\">Michael Milken</a>, say; or former Salomon Brothers boss <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1994/08/19/business/ex-salomon-chief-s-costly-battle.html\" title=\"\">John Gutfreund</a>, whose wife, Susan, once allegedly shut down a whole street to lift a giant Christmas tree by crane into their apartment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/16/donald-trump-announces-run-president\">Donald Trump announces US presidential run with eccentric speech</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Next to those guys, Trump looked like a mere pretender. I know the 80s are making a comeback, but witnessing the tenacious survival of Trump, well, it’s as if <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/01/milli-vanilli-fab-morvan-comeback-man-who-actually-sang\" title=\"\">Milli Vanilli</a> were still in the charts. (Speaking of the undying power of the 80s, the very first presidential campaign I remember was George H W Bush’s 1988 bid, which I watched with my parents. And now, as I’m about to become a parent myself, a Bush is still running for president. Ahhh the circle of life, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuna_matata\" title=\"\"><em>hakuna matata</em></a>. Maybe in some universe a Bush will always be running for president, and when I say “some universe”, I obviously mean “this universe”.)</p> \n<p>The Donald, again just like head lice and bed bugs, has proven himself to be utterly indestructible. On Tuesday he announced that he is running for president – really running for president, that is, as opposed to that time during the last election when he said he might run, but that turned out to be an elaborate means to promote the new series of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2011/may/16/donald-trump-us-presidential-race\" title=\"\">The Apprentice</a>. Or something. It’s never entirely clear what on earth Trump is on about when he opens his mouth, which is always. (Try and picture him with his mouth closed – you can’t. It’s like trying to imagine Beyonc&eacute; ugly, or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/may/29/rush-limbaugh-blame-hunger-games-elliot-rodger\" title=\"\">Rush Limbaugh</a> not being an ass.) Endearingly, this world-class self-promoter was, 24 hours after the announcement, only able to re-tweet one celebrity endorsement of his campaign, and that came from Piers Morgan, so we know we’re dealing with a political heavyweight here.</p> \n<p>I hate to see a man looking lonely so I’d like to add my own very strong endorsement to Trump’s campaign “to make America great again” – the US equivalent of Britain’s “hard-working families”, a phrase now apparently obligatory for all campaigning politicians to mention. Oh sure, some people might bring up the many, many, personal issues that come with this man. But in Trump we have the perfect presidential candidate. Indeed, he distills so many qualities of the modern Republican party that I briefly wondered if he is actually an elaborate satire, like <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/jan/14/nigel-farage-pub-landlord-al-murray\" title=\"\">Al Murray was of Ukip</a> in Britain’s last general election. It does seem the logical explanation for a man who on Tuesday listed his qualifications for being president as: “I’m in competition with Isis – they just built a hotel in Syria!” and “I just sold an apartment for $15 million to somebody from China.”</p> \n<p>But satire requires self-awareness, which is not something one can expect of a man who bloviates against jobs being outsourced to China while simultaneously outsourcing the manufacturing of his own clothes <a href=\"http://www.hollyscoop.com/donald-trump/donald-trump-world-s-greatest-twitter-feud.html\" title=\"\">to that same dreaded country</a>. The truth is, he is the essence of the Republicans boiled down into the figure of a bullfrog topped with a Weetabix. There is the belief that personal wealth makes him special: “I’m really rich! I have a total net worth [of] over $10bn,” he crowed on Tuesday. (No mention, strangely, of the four times Trump’s companies have filed for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/sep/09/trump-casinos-atlantic-city-bankruptcy\" title=\"\">bankruptcy</a>.)</p> \n<p>This might seem a little awkward for Republicans, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2012/sep/18/romneys-47-percent-us-election\" title=\"\">post-Mitt Romney and his 47%</a>, but it makes total sense in a country where, as Chris Rock has put it, people regularly confuse wealth with intelligence, and no one more than Trump. There’s his refusal to believe in things like science, as demonstrated by his ragings against vaccines (<a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/donald-trump-autism-children-vaccinations\" title=\"\">“tiny children are not horses”</a>) and climate change, which he brilliantly disproves with <a href=\"http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/06/16/3670229/president-trump-climate/\" title=\"\">a tweeted photo</a> every time it snows in New York.</p> \n<p>There’s the xenophobia, of course, such as this plan to keep out Mexican immigrants: “I will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I will have Mexico pay for that wall.” As ideas go, that is not even the worst one mooted by former presidential candidates. (I’d go for Rick Santorum’s comparison of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/dec/06/santorum-compares-mandela-apartheid-obamacare-republicans\" title=\"\">Obamacare with apartheid</a>.) His long-term inability to believe a black man could be born in America, as expressed through the euphemism “birtherism”, can also fit under that category. And finally, there’s the fact that he is the product of <a href=\"http://www.alternet.org/story/156234/exposing_how_donald_trump_really_made_his_fortune%3A_inheritance_from_dad_and_the_government%27s_protection_mostly_did_the_trick\" title=\"\">convenient family connections</a>, something which should help him fit in with America’s political establishment from both parties.</p> \n<p>Jon Stewart described Trump this week as “America’s id”. I’d describe him more as America’s spirit animal, the feral creature that exemplifies the country’s extremes. Barack Obama ran in 2008 on the idea that he represented the best of America. Trump could do exactly the same, but in reverse: he is the worst-of-America candidate. So while I definitely don’t want him to be president (he won’t be), I could not endorse his campaign more strongly. Trump! The Worst of America! Feel free to tweet that, Donald.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434562829217/Donald-Trump-announces-ca-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'The Donald, again just like head lice and bed bugs, has proven himself to be utterly indestructible.'

The idea inspired Levy to begin his <a href=\"http://caninenoir.tumblr.com/\">Black Dog Project</a> on their behalf. The dogs Levy photographed came from owners he recruited through his Facebook page. He had also started working with abandoned dogs referred to him by shelters – sharing their photos online in search of permanent homes. They are difficult to photograph well.
