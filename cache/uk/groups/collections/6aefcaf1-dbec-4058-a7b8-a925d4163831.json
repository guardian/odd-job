It’s the day the festivities begin in earnest, with around 3,254 bands and 1,176 DJs appearing on 824 stages. But there was live music last night, with secret shows at William’s Green, and Mark Beaumont was there to catch them …</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>You hunt around all Thursday for a secret set and then three come along at once. After the sex, drugs and genital discharge-obsessed Rebel Bingo has called its last risqu&eacute; number (“your mum’s a whore, 34!” is the only remotely printable example) the pot-luck hordes descend for a trio of TBAs listed at Williams Green, which is essentially Glastonbury catnip. There’s no Kitty, Daisy &amp; Lewis-level disappointment either. At 8.30pm Derbyshire’s Drenge take to a rammed tent with the grunge-Zep onslaught of Running Wild and split the tent. Half the crowd are blown away by their mongrel crossbreed of White Stripes and Nirvana, doused in overdrive that may well be rattling the stone circle to gravel. The other half are blown away by the fact that a band called Drenge don’t sound like a sludge metal dirge fronted by Julian Cope.</p> \n <p>Only a bunch of grunge pop maniacs boasting a midweek N0 1 album described as “the debut of the decade” (copyright this writer, in a gibbering fit, elsewhere) could comfortably follow them, so it’s lucky Wolf Alice take the second unannounced slot. Leaping for a high-set bar, they come out scratching and squealing, rampaging through the ferocious Pixies homage <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USmBzNBI-ec\">You’re a Germ</a> before showcasing the subversive subtleties that make their album <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/21/wolf-alice-my-love-review-cool-giddy-vim-potential\">My Love Is Cool</a> such a delight. Few bands write songs that, like Your Loves Whore, sound by turns like Haim, Stevie Nicks and L7, or mingle Mazzy Star moments like Blush with sludgy pop stampedes like Moaning Lisa Smile, Drenge’s Eoin Loveless guesting on guitar while singer Ellie Rowsell clambers out over the crowd, yowling its euphoric chorus chant. Prince playing atop the Arcadia spider would have nothing on this.</p> \n <p>Expectations pumped, the tent buzzes with anticipation for TBA three.

It’s the day the festivities begin in earnest, with around 3,254 bands and 1,176 DJs appearing on 824 stages. But there was live music last night, with secret shows at William’s Green, and Mark Beaumont was there to catch them …</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>You hunt around all Thursday for a secret set and then three come along at once. After the sex, drugs and genital discharge-obsessed Rebel Bingo has called its last risqu&eacute; number (“your mum’s a whore, 34!” is the only remotely printable example) the pot-luck hordes descend for a trio of TBAs listed at Williams Green, which is essentially Glastonbury catnip. There’s no Kitty, Daisy &amp; Lewis-level disappointment either. At 8.30pm Derbyshire’s Drenge take to a rammed tent with the grunge-Zep onslaught of Running Wild and split the tent. Half the crowd are blown away by their mongrel crossbreed of White Stripes and Nirvana, doused in overdrive that may well be rattling the stone circle to gravel. The other half are blown away by the fact that a band called Drenge don’t sound like a sludge metal dirge fronted by Julian Cope.</p> \n <p>Only a bunch of grunge pop maniacs boasting a midweek N0 1 album described as “the debut of the decade” (copyright this writer, in a gibbering fit, elsewhere) could comfortably follow them, so it’s lucky Wolf Alice take the second unannounced slot. Leaping for a high-set bar, they come out scratching and squealing, rampaging through the ferocious Pixies homage <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USmBzNBI-ec\">You’re a Germ</a> before showcasing the subversive subtleties that make their album <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/21/wolf-alice-my-love-review-cool-giddy-vim-potential\">My Love Is Cool</a> such a delight. Few bands write songs that, like Your Loves Whore, sound by turns like Haim, Stevie Nicks and L7, or mingle Mazzy Star moments like Blush with sludgy pop stampedes like Moaning Lisa Smile, Drenge’s Eoin Loveless guesting on guitar while singer Ellie Rowsell clambers out over the crowd, yowling its euphoric chorus chant. Prince playing atop the Arcadia spider would have nothing on this.</p> \n <p>Expectations pumped, the tent buzzes with anticipation for TBA three. The bar-side bookies close the book on Everything Everything, and the prevalence of bow ties, pork pie hats and trombones trouping onstage for a line-check suggest this would have to mark a fairly drastic shift of style for the heavily rumoured Toy.

In fact, at 57, she looks fantastic: Cheshire-cat grin sweet as ever, genuinely pleased with the commemorative cake the brand has baked for her. It’s teatime halfway through the Cannes film festival and MacDowell is sitting in a suite at the H&ocirc;tel Martinez, one of the most decadent pit stops on the Croisette. This passes for familiar territory: <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/stevensoderbergh\" title=\"\">Steven Soderbergh</a>’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/apr/17/my-favourite-cannes-winner-sex-lies-and-videotape\" title=\"\">Sex, Lies and Videotape</a>, her breakthrough, won the Palme d’Or here in 1989; I assume that was her first Cannes. “I didn’t come,” she says forlornly. “I had just had a baby, and I was afraid people would make fun of me. Because I looked … big. Now people can make fun of me and I don’t mind so much. I was more sensitive back then.”</p> \n<p>Insecurity turns out to be a bit of a leitmotif for MacDowell, alongside the steeliness that carried her through her early struggles as a star. This yin and yang is key to her screen appeal, certainly in her most effective performances: the sexually repressed wife who finds liberation in Sex, Lies and Videotape, the grieving mother who finally snaps in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_review/0,,544570,00.html\" title=\"\">Short Cuts</a>, the kindly news producer who repeatedly slaps <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/bill-murray\" title=\"\">Bill Murray</a>’s weatherman in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/79383/groundhog-day\" title=\"\">Groundhog Day</a>. It has been some time since she starred in a film as impactful as any of those, so it’s easy to forget just how huge she was: during the 1990s she’d already been nominated for three Golden Globes before the release of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/four-weddings-and-a-funeral\" title=\"\">Four Weddings and a Funeral</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/may/07/magic-mike-xxl-trailer-review-no-doom-no-gloom-just-nipples\">Magic Mike XXL trailer review: no doom, no gloom, just nipples</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And now she’s set to return to multiplexes in <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/magic-mike\" title=\"\">Magic Mike XXL</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/channing-tatum\" title=\"\">Channing Tatum</a>’s second ode to male stripping. Much lighter than its predecessor, the film is low on plot, high on road-trip, as Tatum and his abdominal all-stars amble down south for an enormous strip-show; the film is basically one big hen do. Stopping off to meet a friend, they instead find her mother, played by MacDowell as an outrageously flirty, sexually charged, loose-lipped woman who’ll be damned if she’s gonna let her daughter have all the fun. Of the part, MacDowell says she “really wanted it very bad”. Why? “Because the character is completely different than anything I’ve played. She’s really wild, and foul-mouthed.” I ask for an example, because I want Andie MacDowell to swear at me. “Well, I say: ‘Watch your fuckin’ language.’ Which I think is a great line. Hahahaha! Watch your fuckin’ language.” Twice. Mission accomplished.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e64c8e9a5c2a1d1dce4511e921248d302ba01d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435242303529/cf10e1c4-baf5-48e7-b603-1ff4cb50d543-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MacDowell in Magic Mike XXL.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MacDowell in Magic Mike XXL.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>How does she feel about the cougar tag? “Hmm hmm,” she says, but her eyes don’t smile along with her mouth. Does she see her character like that? “I guess so, I think it’s unfair that we don’t have a male equivalent. There was a cougar line; I took it out. I didn’t wanna say it.” So she has a problem with the word? “I have a problem with the word.” Did she bristle when I said it? “Yeah. I just think it’s unnecessary. It’s demeaning. I think the idea that men get more handsome and sexier as they get older is a fallacy. There’s no difference. We’re the same. It was a way to empower men and disempower women. And that’s changing, because if I wanna date someone that’s 20 years younger than me, I can do that now.”</p> \n<p>What really appealed, she says, was how the women in the film – some of them plus-size – get to objectify the men. Such scenes, she says, she found “<em>quite</em> erotic. Oh gosh, they’re just really sexy women”. She almost blushes as she speaks; there’s an innocence about her. What did she think of the first Magic Mike? “It is, I will say, a little odd to go to the movies and get turned on with a bunch of other people. In the room! I was like, oh my <em>gosh</em>, this is an interesting feeling, you know, because it’s <em>really</em> sexy!”</p> \n<p>It took a long time for MacDowell to get what she wanted. Raised in Gaffney, a small town in South Carolina, her ambition was to act, but she didn’t have the courage to pursue it. “And once I started to model, I heard all the negative stuff that people would say. So I was afraid to try. I just didn’t want everybody to make fun of me.” In 1979 she went to New York, walked into the model agency Elite and was signed on the spot. A great time to be in Manhattan – Studio 54, she says, “was crazy. Crazy people dressed up, a lot of transgender looks – imagine that, in 1979. People doing drugs.” Was she attracted to the lifestyle? “No. I burned out on that really fast, because I started working all the time.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14f179f4e28407f5403e3f47ca9added47faec37\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435242371319/992ec448-9c2a-4194-a382-add870a87603-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MacDowell in Sex, Lies and Videotape.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">MacDowell in Sex, Lies and Videotape.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In 1984, at 23, her modelling work brought her to the attention of the producers of Greystoke: the Legend of Tarzan, and she was cast as Jane opposite <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2010/jun/17/christophe-lambert-white-material-highlander\" title=\"\">Christopher Lambert</a>. But her triumph was short-lived: after filming, she learned that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/glenn-close\" title=\"\">Glenn Close</a> was to dub her throughout. “I could have definitely used some more training,” she says, but she was crushed; her fears had been validated. They wanted the face, but not the whole package. “I had three choices. The first was jump out a window. I thought about it.” Seriously? “For about three seconds. But it was an option. And I thought: ‘That’s stupid.’ Option No 2 was give up. Truly give up. ‘You’re no good. You’re a disaster. You’re horrible.’ And option three was fight. ‘Go prove yourself.’ And I chose option three.”</p> \n<p>Soon after, she was cast as the object of Emilio Estevez’s affection in Joel Schumacher’s 1985 bratpack melodrama St Elmo’s Fire. “I was shocked. Because I really was the untouchable.” Really? Or was that just how she felt? “I think I was. Everybody’s perception of me was that I was bad. It didn’t matter what I would do.” Possibly. Her on-screen sweetness in St Elmo’s didn’t lead to much. “I don’t think my performance was outstanding,” she says. “I think I was beautiful. I was very soft, I was very shy, so that didn’t change anybody’s mind.”</p> \n<p>She threw herself into acting classes, and signed with L’Or&eacute;al. But the years went on, and she was at her wits’ end just as Sex, Lies and Videotape turned up. Soderbergh had written the role of Ann, who discovers her husband is cheating on her, for Elizabeth McGovern, but her agent hated the script and never told her about it. Soderbergh didn’t want to see her (“Andie was forced upon me,” he says on the DVD commentary), but MacDowell was confident she’d get Ann right.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/feb/04/magic-mike-xxl-trailer-super-size-my-channing-hold-the-mcconaughey\">Magic Mike XXL trailer – super-size my Channing, hold the McConaughey</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“She was from the south. That’s not hard for me. And I knew a lot of women like her. Women who were frigid. There was this thing in the south, it used to be that the purity of a woman was so important. And my character was the A-student, wanted to get everything right. She was pure. She equated sex with not being pure.” She improvised in her audition, surprising Soderbergh; he cast her, later saying she’d blown his mind. To this day she says it’s the best role she’s ever been given, and it stands up as a frustrated, pent-up performance. “This poor woman hadn’t had an orgasm, what do you expect?” she laughs. The film changed her life: “I got out of the hole. I climbed my way out.”</p> \n<p>Sex, Lies and Videotape won her her first Golden Globe nomination; suddenly, credible film-makers wanted to work with her: <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/peter-weir\" title=\"\">Peter Weir</a> (Green Card), <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/robertaltman\" title=\"\">Robert Altman</a> (Short Cuts and The Player), <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/harold-ramis\" title=\"\">Harold Ramis</a> (Groundhog Day and Multiplicity). She beat Jennifer Jason Leigh, Julianne Moore and Laura Dern for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2010/sep/19/film-changed-life-grande-illusion\" title=\"\">Mike Newell</a>’s Four Weddings and a Funeral. The film’s budget was only &pound;2.8m, and she accepted a low fee as she thought “the script was perfect. It was flawless. Gorgeous.” In lieu of upfront cash, she took percentage points, which proved smart when it made &pound;159m. In Cannes for the film, surrounded by bodyguards, fans rocked her car on the way to the red carpet. This was 1994 – she was 36, and hit peak fame. “But it passes,” she says. In the late 90s she worked for Nora Ephron, Wim Wenders and Albert Brooks, but the 21st century resigned her to less impressive TV movies.</p> \n<p>She’s said in the past that professional rejection led her to therapy, which she now lives for. “I love the study of ego,” she says. “It’s a very cathartic way to live your life. Because we are victimised by what the world throws at us. Life can be hard … And projection. People project all kinds of cuckoo things on to actors.” Recently, she’s taken to addressing herself out loud, a technique she read about in a psychology magazine. It’s soothing, she says. “I use my name, Rose [her birth name is Rosalie Anderson MacDowell]. If I’m starting to panic, I go: ‘Uh uh, Rose: you’ve got this.’ It calms you down.”</p> \n<p>Magic Mike XXL reunites her with Soderbergh, who directed the original and took cinematography and editing duties on this one. “My heart was wide open, just to see him again,” she says. Their reunion made her feel reflective. Looking back on her career now, she says she regrets turning down certain roles because she was afraid of disappointing her family and queering her reputation back home. “I think the reason I understood [Sex, Lies and Videotape’s] Ann Bishop Mullany so well is I grew up in a culture where to be sexual was dirty. And I was also afraid of embarrassing my children. I was so afraid what people would say about me in my community. This was my way of thinking because I grew up around that kind of pressure, of purity. That was so much my childhood that I was afraid to be too provocative. Finally now, I realise. It’s kind of late in the day to be really provocative, but now I would do it. I’m sad that I didn’t take more chances.” What did she turn down? “There were some sexual roles I could have definitely fought for, at least.” Adrian Lyne’s kinkfest 9&frac12; Weeks was one, she says. “Now, in hindsight, if I could just tell my younger self to go in and fight for it. I didn’t even go in!”</p> \n<p>Is her Magic Mike role an attempt to redress that balance? The start of phase two? She laughs. “Some crazy sexy roles since I’m no longer worried about what people think? Hahahaha! Maybe!

As she prepares for the biggest night of her life headlining the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury, she opens up about karaoke, learning to cope and why she’s scared of her own voice</p>","byline":"Sophie Heawood","body":"<p>Florence Welch has woken up in some exciting places. Ask her about the time she drank so many dirty martinis with Kanye West and Lykke Li that she woke up in bed at the Bowery Hotel in New York to discover she had chipped her tooth and set the room on fire. Or the time, after playing the Hollywood Bowl, that she had seven extra beds sent up to her hotel room at the Chateau Marmont at 4am for her friends to sleep in.</p> \n<p>On the other hand, there was the recent night at the campsite her dad runs in Sussex, when he hadn’t got a tent for her so she had to sleep in Shamanic Sid’s caravan (“he’s a really practical groundsman, but he’s also a shaman”). She walked into the woods, found a man brandishing a broadsword, was told to go away, then found out her dad didn’t have any food either. “So he said: ‘Oh, we’ll just go round the site and see what people are cooking.’ And we ended up asking strangers for some of their sausages.” It’s certainly one way to keep your famous child grounded.</p> \n<p>At 28, Welch is now preparing for what might be the biggest night of her life – headlining Friday night at Glastonbury. After <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/video/2015/jun/13/dave-grohl-foo-fighters-broke-leg-gothenburg-sweden-video\">Dave Grohl broke his leg during a concert in Gothenburg</a> and the Foo Fighters pulled out, Florence + the Machine were bumped up to the top slot. The night looks set to be half glamour, half Shamanic Sid. When we speak a few days before the festival, Welch is ruminating on the strange series of events that have got her here. Her foot, which, in an echo of Grohl’s accident, she recently broke on stage, has only just healed, and the songs she will play from her new album, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/28/florence-and-the-machine-how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful-review\">How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful</a>, are about falling and crashing in a more spiritual sense.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/28/florence-and-the-machine-how-big-how-blue-how-beautiful-review\">Florence + the Machine: How Big How Blue How Beautiful review – same drama, new hits</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“It’s the broken hearts and broken limbs that led to Glastonbury,” she says. “It’s a strange and quite cracked way to get there. Literally. If I’d had six months knowing that I was going to do this [headline slot], I think I would have slowly descended into madness. But Glastonbury is such a powerful place that I feel we should get everyone in the crowd to use their healing powers – utilise the ley lines – to help Dave’s leg. Maybe I should hold a ceremony in the healing fields for him.”</p> \n<p>But let’s rewind a couple of weeks, to when Grohl had fully functioning limbs and Florence was less daunted and very cheerful, sitting at her kitchen table in south London, making some herbal tea while I asked her about her new album, which is named for the Los Angeles skyline. On the song <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XgeKHTcufLY\">What Kind of Man</a>, she sings: “I was on a heavy trip, trying to cross a canyon with a broken limb.” Those lines described her life: she kept splitting up with her boyfriend and life was continually crashing down around her. After spending years on the merry-go-round, careering too fast, she got off it and finally moved out of her mum’s house – only to find that sitting in your own kitchen can send you even crazier than the glittering parties. She had become famous young. She hadn’t learned to cook. She hadn’t learned to cope.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9v8jLBrvug\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/B9v8jLBrvug?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>“I think living on my own for the first time showed me that I was actually quite sensitive, and was prone to highs and lows, and maybe needed to figure out a way of managing that a bit more, because when you’re left to your own devices and you find you can’t actually leave the house … some of it was desperate. I had been looking for other people to look after me, and that creates this really exhausting cycle for everyone involved. It’s very tiring. I think I can see that now,” she says, laughing at the embarrassing realisation that she might have been a bit of a nightmare.</p> \n<p>I point out that it would be a shame to regret the whole thing though - surely the party years were fun? “Oh, it was fucking fab. I had a great time. I think I just funned myself out. I’m glad, I needed to – but there were moments where I wish I hadn’t ended up on the news, singing a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JP7kIgZQBhA\">batshit karaoke version of Get Lucky in a tiki bar</a> and then crowdsurfing on to nobody. My manager rang me saying: ‘Er, have you done any cover versions recently? Because there’s this footage …’ I thought I’d got away with that one. So that was when I wrote Ship To Wreck, which is a song about self-destruction.”</p> \n<p>She had a period where she thought she might be a depressive, but she now thinks she is actually porous – she soaks up other people’s emotions and then feels them even more vividly than they do. So she can be very upbeat, like she is today, “but I’ve had relationships in the past where, say, if someone’s sad, I’ve gone round to look after them, I’ve laid in bed with them and,” she mimes spooning somebody, “then in the morning, I’d wake up and I’d be like, full. Absolutely full to the brim, and weeping hysterically.” She says her dad sometimes drives his red sports car into her garden and stays on the sofa for the weekend, but their temperaments are too similar, and they mope around the house saying to each other: “Are you sad? I think I’m sad.” Fortunately, her mum also comes round a lot, too (her parents divorced years ago) and the other day she said to Florence: “You know, you’re just a normal person really, who does all this other stuff, too” – a statement that seems to have brought her huge relief.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Florence and the Machine\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:album:0Om2TWqroaCLQamQME3bD2\" width=\"300\" height=\"380\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>All the other stuff, though, is what we are here to talk about. When I first saw Welch sing, eight years ago, at a daytime event for unsigned artists in a north London pub, her voice was the biggest thing in the room, electrifying, singing these stark, dark songs, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1SmxVCM39j4\">Kiss with a Fist</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl_jfkORNF8\">My Boy Builds Coffins</a>. Then she got discovered, signed a record deal, and the songs began to grow, like gardens that grow over themselves. Her first two albums, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2009/jul/05/review-florence-and-the-machine\">Lungs</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2011/oct/30/florence-machine-ceremonials-review\">Ceremonials</a>, were dramatic, harp-laden affairs that achieved the rare feat of breaking America – Ceremonials reached No 6 in the US and Florence + the Machine received two Grammy nominations in its wake. The girl raised in a bohemian house full of kids in south London, by an art historian mother, was now a global star, invited on American chatshows, to talk about collaborating with Kanye, to hang out with Beyonc&eacute; and Jay-Z.</p> \n<p>But the simple connection to her original electricity had been lost. It seems that producer Markus Dravs thought so, too, which became clear to Welch after she brought him in to work with Paul Epworth on the new album. She wrote certain songs, including St Jude and Ship to Wreck, quite simply and immediately. “And then this huge trumpet-heavy Which Witch one, where I thought Markus would say: ‘Yeah, that’s it!’ because it was big. But actually he was a lot more interested in the quieter, vulnerable ones. I just thought they were too simple. I was like: ‘Where’s all the STUFF?’ I’m like: ‘Me and Isa [Isabella Summers, the Machine of the group name, and the only other permanent member] have spent weeks on this big one, there are imaginary covens, all these vocals on top of the other, I’ve sung a hundred takes and put in a weird football chant at the end – and now you just want this one that took five minutes? Where’s the big finish? Can I at least have more reverb?’”</p> \n<p>Did she feel a song that came too easily, too simply, was somehow unearned? She nods. “Exactly.” She and Dravs had a lot of arguments about reverb, “which I love, because I’m pretty much scared of the sound of my own voice, as it is, because I think it’s so exposing. Live, I kind of know what I’m doing, but hearing it on record, it’s like hearing your own voice on tape, I’m just like: ‘Argh.’ So I love effects, and I love loads of layers on my vocals, because you can’t quite hear what’s going on, and that is my safe space. But Markus said: ‘This is your safe space. These big songs, that’s what you feel comfortable doing. We’re going to try to do something that makes you feel uncomfortable.’”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fa7ef429f14b9ac71ad1e8420280a21034c1be6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435245396399/1dfc9e0e-331b-4eee-b5c9-275ef45018dd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Big voice … Welch.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Big voice … Welch.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Loccisano</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She won half of the reverb wars, so there are still a lot of big songs on the album. She was inspired by <a href=\"http://www.valimyers.org/\">Vali Myers</a>, a bohemian artist who made paintings based on Aboriginal dream songs. “They would take her 10 years to make and she had a tattoo of a moustache. She became the spirit animal for this record, because she would go to the dream world and bring back ideas for her paintings, and she lived in a cave in Portofino with foxes and she was an amazing lady, really incredible. And then, me and Isa were in LA and thinking about this kind of idea of a witch trial in LA, a Hollywood love story that goes wrong, and someone dies. It was kind of about things that were happening in my real life, but again, escapism. I started singing trumpet lines – I would sing them, and then we would try to make them work on a Midi keyboard, which is impossible. And huge big clapping, stamping, feral feet. That was kind of an armour against what I was feeling: it was like: ‘Fuck you, look at this big song I’ve made!’”</p> \n<p>The album took her through a lot of feelings that had been unresolved until she put them to music. “The problem is that I’m not very good at saying how I feel, in person. When you’re a performer, you want to make people feel good. And when you do that on such a grand scale … when your feelings are difficult, smaller and more domestic, you’re just like: ‘I have no idea how that is said. Do you want me to sing it?’ I can go and sing it to loads of strangers, but this kind of … the intensity of actual day-to-day intimacy …”</p> \n<p>She shows me a piece of art she made when she studied at Camberwell School of Art for a bit. It is a tiny glass jar with some paper bees hanging inside it and a sign saying: “I’m so sorry for everything and I’m going to stay in here with the bees until you forgive me.”</p> \n<p>So what was she so guilty about?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"673a204436b7d8187df0ef5c44522e0bfe67fadf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435245489249/c98b8c41-b03b-4b35-86d7-25cb439eab77-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Performing with Dizzee Rascal at The Brit Awards 2010.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Performing with Dizzee Rascal at The Brit Awards 2010.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave M Benett</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Well, I was always getting drunk and snogging people! Which actually, thinking about it, wasn’t that bad. But it created a very – I was just like: ‘Arghh! What am I doing? Why am I doing this again?’ I would wake up somewhere really random and have to cancel cards, cancel phones. There was always a lost handbag. A trail of absolute destruction.” She had singing lessons with a teacher who said: if you want to be a singer, don’t shout, don’t talk loudly, don’t smoke, don’t drink, or go to loud places. “And I was like: ‘I want to do all of that stuff, RIGHT NOW.’ I would start smoking on the way back from singing lessons.</p> \n<p>“It was weird, because singing for a while was something that I felt was like secret, my secret thing. When I was little, at school, I just felt quite mundane. But I remember singing in the school hallways when everyone else was in class, because of the echoes, and the resonance was so wonderful, and I can remember that feeling of: ‘Whoa, what is this? This is something.’”</p> \n<p>She shows me round her house, which is so beautifully decorated and full of art and treasures that I am surprised to find out she only rents it. She is trying to buy a house somewhere else, a bigger one, as she would like to have children. The video for Ship to Wreck was shot here, and she found it odd to have all these people in her elaborately curated home. “I’ve done videos where I have to take my top off, that’s fine, nudity doesn’t bother me at all – but having people around my possessions. I’m like: ‘DON’T MESS UP MY STUFF,’” she laughs.</p> \n<p>And then she remembers something else from childhood, which for me, sums her up entirely, and explains why her songs get so large, and her life so performative.</p> \n<p>“We were on a family holiday to Turkey, I’d gone off for a walk on my own, and I remember first seeing these ancient ruins, and being so completely sensorily overwhelmed by how beautiful they were. Just trying to suck it into my body and my brain somehow. I was trying to feast on it. I really wanted all of it, and I was frustrated that my eyes weren’t – I didn’t know how to get it. I was like: ‘I WANT.’ And I think that’s a feeling that I have about the world sometimes. I’m just like: ‘I want to suck it into myself somehow.’ Those quite big feelings can create something almost uncomfortable and so they have to come out in a really big way.”</p> \n<p>Which is another way of saying that the reverb wars are not over for a long time yet. I do wonder what will happen when she comes full circle to the 19-year-old girl singing in a bar on a Sunday afternoon.</p> \n<p><em>Florence + the Machine headline Glastonbury Friday 26 June.

If just one country is doing the right thing but other countries are not, then we’re not going to solve the problem, we’re going to have to have a global solution to this.</p> \n<p>“What we’re seeing are global trends that depends on the entire world working together, and sadly we haven’t made as much progress as we need to on climate change.”</p> \n<p>Attenborough says that being invited to meet the president on his 89th birthday – the first time in his long career he had ever visited the White House – had been “a considerable surprise”. He says he found the president “friendly, hospitable and genuine”. </p> \n<p>The president tells Attenborough that he grew up watching his programmes. Attenborough presented his first natural history programme for the BBC in 1954. The pair discuss the broadcaster’s career, his recent trip to dive in the Great Barrier Reef, (<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-29141151\">which he has called “the most magical thing” he has ever seen</a>), and what he believes needs to be done about pressing issues such as the rising population, climate change and renewable energy.</p> \n<p>“I believe [if] we find ways of generating and storing power from renewable resources we will make the problem with oil and coal disappear,” Attenborough tells the president, “because economically, we’ll wish to use these other methods. If we do that, a huge step will be taken in solving the problems of the Earth. I think what’s required is an understanding and a gut feeling that the natural world is part of your inheritance. This is the only planet we’ve got and we’ve got to protect it. And people do feel that, deeply and instinctively, it is after all where you go in moments of celebration and in moments of grief.”</p> \n<p>Obama, in turn, talks about his paternal roots in Kenya as well as his childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, and how travelling across the world throughout his life had shaped his thoughts on the environment. </p> \n<p>Attenborough has previously said he believed Obama was “very much in favour of tackling climate change … [but] of course, as we also know, he is coming to the end of his last presidency”.</p> \n<p>The broadcaster recently helped launch the <a href=\"http://globalapolloprogramme.org/\">Global Apollo Programme</a>, which aims to double the amount of money being spent on research and development of renewable energy, calling on world leaders to spend 0.02% of GDP on developing clean-energy technologies.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435257820462/139b360c-2d9e-4ce6-9dd5-d8630100a51b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chuck Kennedy/The White House","altText":"Barack Obama and Sir David Attenborough","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chuck Kennedy/The White House"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T21:32:53Z","lastModified":"2015-06-26T00:58:19Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":244,"contributors":[{"name":"Esther Addley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/estheraddley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["David Attenborough","Barack Obama","Climate change","Renewable energy","Conservation","Wildlife","BBC","Television","Environment","US politics","UK news","US news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/david-attenborough","webTitle":"David Attenborough"},{"id":"us-news/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama"},{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change"},{"id":"environment/renewableenergy","webTitle":"Renewable energy"},{"id":"environment/conservation","webTitle":"Conservation"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"us-news/us-politics","webTitle":"US politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Esther Addley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/estheraddley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"tv-and-radio"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/25/sir-david-attenborough-and-barack-obama-face-to-face-in-tv-interview","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a5zn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/25/sir-david-attenborough-and-barack-obama-face-to-face-in-tv-interview","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/25/sir-david-attenborough-and-barack-obama-face-to-face-in-tv-interview"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457279011","source":"BBC One, Sunday 28th June at 10.30pm","durationInSeconds":107,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/25/150625Obama_1.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/25/150625Obama_1_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/25/1435273145607/KP_325336_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Barack Obama interviews David Attenborough on climate change -

Much children’s literature is a hazard for double entendres","byline":"Nicholas Tucker","body":"<p>The brave and resourceful&nbsp;small girl in&nbsp;Arthur Ransome’s 1930&nbsp;classic, Swallows and Amazons, is called Titty. But not, we learn, in the new film&nbsp;version being made by the BBC. There she will be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/25/arthur-ransomes-titty-name-print-swallows-and-amazons\" title=\"\">renamed Tatty</a>, to avoid “too many sniggers”.</p> \n<p>It’s not the first time this indignity has&nbsp;befallen Titty, who was named after the traditional English fairytale, Titty Mouse and Tatty Mouse, in a more innocent age. (According to the Online Etymological Dictionary, the word “tits” only started being associated with breasts in about 1928.) She was rechristened Kitty when the story was televised by the BBC in 1963, though she&nbsp;re-emerged with her original name in the 1974 film adaptation, and in a later radio broadcast in 2012.</p> \n<p>Names have long been a hazard in children’s literature. The headmistress and popular children’s writer <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elinor_Brent-Dyer\" title=\"\">Elinor Brent-Dyer</a> provides two more examples of how an original text can be rendered sadly inappropriate over time. In her 1930 story The School by the River she wrote: “The Principal allowed the girls much liberty, but intercourse with the men from the Academia was strictly forbidden, and any girl who transgressed this rule, and was found out more than once, was sent away.” Use of the word intercourse with reference to sexual activity has been current since 1798, so 1930 seems quite late for Brent-Dyer still to be using it in its original sense.</p> \n<p>Twenty years later, the same author ran into more potential problems in The Chalet School and the Island. Fiery 15-year-old Annis exclaims at one point: “That doesn’t seem to have occurred to Aunt Margaret. I suppose she thinks that all that matters is a decent screw and holidays.” Publisher Collins waited until 1999 and a new edition before finally changing “screw” to “salary”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Any editorial intervention could have run the risk of offending otherwise upright, and high-earning, authors</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“Ejaculate”, another potentially troublesome word, was at one time popular with authors as an alternative to “exclaimed”. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle – not quite a children’s author but always loved by young readers – used it 23 times in his Sherlock Holmes stories, most arrestingly in The Man with the Twisted Lip (1891), when Watson, after dozing off in the great detective’s study, reports&nbsp;that “a sudden ejaculation caused me to wake up”.</p> \n<p>As a doctor, Doyle would have known the term in its sexual context, but at a time when open discussion of such matters was reserved for medical textbooks, could have thought that its use in another sense was perfectly justified. More probably, he simply missed the double meaning altogether. This was also true years later of the young Dr Seuss, whose first publications in the 1930s, Boners, More Boners, Still More Boners and The Pocketbook of Boners are now collectors’ items.</p> \n<p>“Cock” as slang for the male member has been current since 1610. Yet in the chapter headed Aunt Jane’s Treat in Richmal Crompton’s 1924 novel, William the Fourth, one of William’s respectable maiden aunts accompanies him to a fair, where she rides on a merry-go-round, mounting – as the author puts it – “a giant cock” … “It seemed to give her a joy that all her blameless life had so far failed to produce,” it says.</p> \n<p>Something similar, again involving a cockerell-shaped fairground attraction, takes place in Angela Thirkell’s 1939 novel The Brandons. This example of light fiction was aimed not at children but at a largely female, middle-class audience whose ultra-respectability amounted to another form of assumed literary innocence.</p> \n<p>Crompton was a blameless ex-classics teacher, and Thirkell was the distinctly snobbish granddaughter of the pre-Raphaelite artist Edward Burne-Jones. It&nbsp;is unthinkable that either had any idea&nbsp;of another possible reading of what they had written.</p> \n<p>The publishers and editors who passed these passages may have been similarly ignorant, or they may simply have decided to leave well alone. Resetting odd pages in any reprint can be an expensive business, and any intervention could also have run the risk of offending otherwise upright and high-earning authors who may not have even recognised any double meanings had they been brought to their attention.</p> \n<p>Today, double entendres are the regular stuff of comedy, even when writing for children. When AA Milne referred to Pooh “poohing in the sun” in a poem in The House at Pooh Corner, he unleashed decades of quiet merriment among parents and grandparents aware of how the meaning had changed since they were six. But perhaps the most devoted Milne fans reading to children now would draw the line at two American spin-offs, both picture books: Marlene Brown’s Cooking with Pooh (1995) and Isabel Gaines’s Pooh Gets Stuck (1998). Those earlier, unconscious verbal slips were so much funnier.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435253550708/cb638d7e-80d6-437a-8d41-2d1860b0e3ae-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'When AA Milne referred to Pooh ‘poohing in the sun’, he unleashed decades of quiet merriment.'

That was the defining message of this year’s E3 expo in Los Angeles.</p> \n<p>Fans have been demanding Shenmue 3 for over a decade, while a Final Fantasy VII remake has been the stuff of spiky haired dreams since Square Enix started obsessively mining the series for spin-offs, reboots and sequels to sequels many years ago.</p> \n<p>So the fact that our prayers have been answered is terrific news, right? It’s better than Christmas. It’s the best thing that could ever conceivably happen. It’s... oh wait, we have fallen right into a nostalgia trap. Of course, there’s nothing wrong with wallowing in the quicksand of reminiscence, but it’s important to remember that sequels to, and remakes of, legendary titles will never realistically be able to live up to our expectations. It’s also worth thinking about why, after such a long time, these two games are coming out now.</p> \n<p>The answer is pretty simple – nostalgia sells and these days it has its own store: Kickstarter. Pillars of Eternity, the entirely fan-backed homage to Baldur’s Gate, earned $4m. Shenmue 3 raised $2m in under nine hours and is now at $3.5m. Over the years there have been dozens of campaigns to get Shenmue 3 released, but until Kickstarter participants had no real power or access to change Sega’s mind. Now Yu Suzuki has given at least the beginning of that power to the fanbase. If Square Enix had sought crowd funding for FFVII, we could expect a similar stratospheric figure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZNt_Pc6IdMc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZNt_Pc6IdMc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There have been reports that further investment for Shenmue will eventually come from Sony or other companies (though Yu Suzuki himself has <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ysnet/shenmue-3/posts/1273833\">denied this on the game’s Kickstarter page</a>), but $2m in a day clearly signifies how much of a market there is for the game. The Final Fantasy VII remake will be published by Square Enix but the company already knows it is on to a winner: re-releases for Final Fantasy VII on Steam, and on the PC in general, have been met with profitable fanaticism. There’s a lot of love for this era of Final Fantasy (VI-X) but Final Fantasy VII has always been the focus, it’s the trump card.</p> \n<p>The thing is, what happens in the future? How far can this nostalgia industry go?</p> \n<p>For a long time, Final Fantasy VII all but defined the role-playing game (RPG) genre – especially in the West. It had a huge influence on my childhood and was one of the first games I played and fully understood. But that’s the thing, it was my childhood. Nostalgia binds personal memories with the games themselves to create a heady, though misleading concoction of joy. I’ve hoped year after year for these announcements, but I’m still very apprehensive. This is about more than the re-release of two old titles; it’s bringing a culture of gaming back into a world that, for better or worse, has moved on. Shenmue and Final Fantasy VII were very different experiences but they were both, in many ways, pioneers in their sectors and some of the most memorable moments of both games were the inane quirks which don’t fit neatly into the sleek user experiences we see in most games today.</p> \n<p>Indeed, by our contemporary standards, Shenmue and Final Fantasy VII were clunky and often unintuitive. In Final Fantasy VII moving could be confusing if you couldn’t clearly see where your character was or where you were trying to get to. Do we all remember climbing up to the Shinra offices and having to grab that swinging pole? That wasn’t fun. It was an atmospheric, gripping and inspiring scene but it wasn’t fun.</p> \n<p>Ditto for Shenmue where Ryu would often get stuck running into walls, wouldn’t turn properly or the game would provide intricate combat moves which you’d only rarely get to use. Both titles provided elaborate levelling systems and character progression that could, by and large, be ignored. The materia system in Final Fantasy VII was great but its finer points were rendered irrelevant due to the game’s relatively tame difficulty. Shenmue had alternate move-sets for dedicated players (flashback to spending four hours training Double Blow in a car park) but again there was no real need to do this.</p> \n<h2>The feel of Shenmue</h2> \n<p>What made Final Fantasy VII and Shenmue resonate with me was the atmosphere they created. I remember when I first played Final Fantasy VII I spent about fifteen minutes just standing on the train back from the first mission, the music, the sense that we’d just achieved something huge and should take a breath and relax, the dialogue... it was amazing. The graphics didn’t matter – each intricate detail of the train moving was enough to enthrall me.</p> \n<p>Shenmue’s level of detail was mind blowing at the time; it seemed to provide an accurate snapshot of Japan in the late 1980s with all the mundane rhythms of everyday life baked into a gripping narrative. Ryu had to get home before 11pm or his housekeeper would scold him the next day, he had to go to work, talk to people he didn’t like, engage in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L52OIIZHaKE\">awkward conversations about sailors</a>, as well as do exciting things like fight a gang and avenge his father. It was all part of the magic for me, playing in the game’s arcade and thinking “better head home in 10 minutes or I’ll be in trouble with Ine-san tomorrow”. It was a level of realism I’d never experienced in a game before and that’s why I have such fond memories of it.</p> \n<p>But the games I think of as classics may well be unapproachable, lacklustre and irrelevant to the current generation of gamer. Will this market find Shenmue’s hilariously “off” English dubbing endearing, would translation errors which became almost meme-like in the original Final Fantasy VII get the same warm reaction today? I doubt it. But then if nostalgia can fund and sustain a game, publishers don’t need to appeal to the demographic that will be horrified by the shortcomings of older titles. This is where there could be problems as two worlds collide: will shiny new reboots get wider appeal while alienating core fans apprehensive about overt changes to game systems? Or will the games be obsessively faithful to the past, ensuring that only committed fans will want to play them?</p> \n<p>And even the most ardent of nostalgics may well be disappointed. After years of lavish open-world spectaculars like Skyrim, Grand Theft Auto 5 and Witcher 3, will Shenmue and Finally Fantasy VII feel a teeny bit... anemic? There’s little replayability with either of them, after all. They’re both linear, fixed stories with limited worlds to explore. 1997-1999 wasn’t an era of DLC or additional content, Final Fantasy VII had its secrets (and secret they stayed unless you picked up a magazine with hints); Shenmue had options, but not a lot of real freedom.</p> \n<p>True, Pillars of Eternity proved that nostalgic games can still provide more content than most people have time for: in that game, if you finish every quest you can replay as a different character with a completely different background and see a whole new aspect of the story. Final Fantasy VII never offered that choice – there are many who would say it never should do. Beyond reliving a brilliant story and chasing secrets you may have missed in an earlier playthrough, there was no real reason to replay Final Fantasy VII. There might be an expectation that Shenmue 3 and a remade Final Fantasy VII should offer vast open worlds with randomly generated experiences written in such a way that don’t make them generic but, in my opinion, that would not be in the spirit of either game.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kznek1uNVsg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kznek1uNVsg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><br />I’m not saying this isn’t Super Christmas Time, I’m just saying we have to be realistic. The Final Fantasy VII remake trailer gave me goosebumps and I’m sure any Shenmue 3 promotional material (by this point even a graphically updated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbzxnU7zkdg\">Ryu drinking a can of delicious soda</a>) will have the same effect, but to avoid heartbreak and disappointment we have to wait to see what these games will actually <em>be</em>.</p> \n<p>I mean, although Final Fantasy: Advent Children carried the license and had most of the major characters in it, I didn’t find the experience that compelling or interesting. Obviously it was a film not a game and the story was contrary to a lot of what you experience in Final Fantasy VII, but all the glitz and updated CGI graphics couldn’t fill the void or hit me where the original Final Fantasy VII had.</p> \n<p>By all means get excited, but bear in mind it takes more than nostalgia to make a fulfilling game. And anyway, we can’t truly say our work is done until we have Half-Life 3. And a new Legacy of Kain. And... oh you get the point. The thing about nostalgia is, it’s never truly satisfied.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435145527292/be6ff9d4-1cde-47c1-9db2-cb54e3bb49df-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sega","altText":"Shenmue 2","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sega"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-26T05:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-06-26T07:46:24Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":45,"contributors":[{"name":"Jonathan Allford","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jonathan-allford"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Games","Game culture","Culture","Technology","Retro games","PC","Xbox","Xbox One","PlayStation","PlayStation 4"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/games","webTitle":"Games"},{"id":"technology/gameculture","webTitle":"Game culture"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"technology/retro","webTitle":"Retro games"},{"id":"technology/pc","webTitle":"PC"},{"id":"technology/xbox","webTitle":"Xbox"},{"id":"technology/xbox-one","webTitle":"Xbox One"},{"id":"technology/playstation","webTitle":"PlayStation"},{"id":"technology/playstation-4","webTitle":"PlayStation 4"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jonathan Allford","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jonathan-allford"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/26/shenmue-final-fantasy-vii-and-why-we-shouldnt-entirely-give-in-to-nostalgia","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4bd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/jun/26/shenmue-final-fantasy-vii-and-why-we-shouldnt-entirely-give-in-to-nostalgia","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/26/shenmue-final-fantasy-vii-and-why-we-shouldnt-entirely-give-in-to-nostalgia"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435145527292/be6ff9d4-1cde-47c1-9db2-cb54e3bb49df-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Can Shenmue III build on the experience of its predecessors without losing their original clunky charm?","credit":"Sega","altText":"Shenmue 2","cleanCaption":"Can Shenmue III build on the experience of its predecessors without losing their original clunky charm?"}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Games"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435145527292/be6ff9d4-1cde-47c1-9db2-cb54e3bb49df-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sega","altText":"Shenmue 2","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sega"}}]},{"title":"Havin' a giraffe! / Safari selfies taken by the animals","rawTitle":"Safari selfies taken by the animals","item":{"type":"gallery","id":"artanddesign/gallery/2015/jun/26/safari-selfies-lions-giraffes-cheetahs-serengeti-in-pictures-photography","title":"Havin' a giraffe!
