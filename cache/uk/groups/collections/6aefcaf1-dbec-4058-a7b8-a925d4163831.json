And soon, of course, there’ll come a time when that too is not enough. The dino-attraction meltdown franchise – invented by novelist Michael Crichton and given an incomparable gloss by director Steven Spielberg – has been renewed and upgraded for a fourth movie. Once again, the prehistoric creatures have bust their pen and they’re running riot.</p> \n<p>Jurassic World doesn’t have an equivalent of Samuel L Jackson’s chain-smoking employee Arnold from the first film, or indeed anything like its all-but-subliminal reference to J Robert Oppenheimer. But this is still a terrifically enjoyable and exciting summer spectacular: savvy, funny, ridiculous in just the right way, with some smart imaginative twists on the idea of how dinosaurs could be repositioned in a consumer marketplace where they are almost commonplace, and how the military might take a sinister interest in weaponising these scary beasts. There’s an almost Gaia-ist conception of how dinosaurs might solve their own crises and in a (partial) nod to contemporary views, we get a heroine who can take out dinosaurs with a stun gun and also run very fast away from them in heels. All these dinosaurs are female, which incidentally puts Jurassic World in the clear as far as the Bechdel test is concerned.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6259ab5f-20f0-4f84-8297-a07cafe0625f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433929324690/1b188c32-dae5-4f35-9f78-837c176737e6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"CHRIS PRATT &amp; BRYCE DALLAS HOWARD Character(s): Owen, Claire Film 'JURASSIC WORLD' (2015) Directed By COLIN TREVORROW 10 June 2015 SAL45844 Allstar/UNIVERSAL PICTURES  (USA 2015)  **WARNING**This Photograph is for editorial use only and is the copyright of UNIVERSAL PICTURES and/or the Photographer assigned by the Film or Production Company &amp; can only be reproduced by publications in conjunction with the promotion of the above Film.A Mandatory Credit To UNIVERSAL PICTURES is required.The Photographer should also be credited when known.No commercial use can be granted without written authority from the Film Company.Entertainment Orientation Landscape STOOD FULL LENGTHFilm StillAdventureFantasy\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard in Jurassic World</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was written by husband-and-wife team Rick Jaffa and Amanda Silver and directed by Colin Trevorrow, whose last feature outing was the indie comedy Safety Not Guaranteed. But, most importantly, it is executive-produced by Spielberg himself, whose influence is in every base pair of the film’s DNA.

She is also a bit nervous about the creepy new GM mega-dinosaur they have secretly created to boost visitor numbers: the terrifying <em>Indominus Rex</em>, created by lab supremo Dr Henry Wu (BD Wong) and watched over by the sinister military consultant Hoskins (Vincent D’Onofrio).</p> \n<p>Do these people quite realise how intelligent and aggressive their new dinosaur is, do you suppose, and how very unlikely it is to remain within its paddock? To add to her personal non-dinosaur issues, Claire just happens to have some chemistry with fellow JW employee Owen (Chris Pratt), a rough-and-ready Indiana Jones-ish raptor wrangler and dinosaur whisperer who has actually trained a performing group of prehistoric carnivores to do his bidding for the tourists: he also rides a motorbike, wears a leather waistcoat and appears to live in a lakeside caravan. Needless to say, rescuing the two boys from the upcoming dino catastrophe is going to bring Owen and Claire together and generally end their emotional ice age.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-66b3c234-4bc8-4d83-8c0c-4bf02cdc2bdf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433928624687/da7d403a-998f-4966-80d2-bf911dcc23d9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jurassic World\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Owen is an old-fashioned guy, a rough outdoorsy sort, a man’s man, maybe kind of a … well, what’s the figure of speech for an extinct old-fashioned type? Certainly not “dinosaur”: they were vigorous and capable survivors who might yet turn out to have been on earth longer than humans. Chris Pratt gives a tremendously likeable performance as Owen: easy-going, relaxed, somewhere on a continuum between Harrison Ford and Tom Hanks. Bryce Dallas Howard (who I always remember in Lars Von Trier’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2006/mar/03/2\">Manderlay</a> and M Night Shyamalan’s preposterous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/News_Story/Critic_Review/Guardian_Film_of_the_week/0,4267,1286595,00.html\">The Village</a>) is also very good: coiffured and groomed and composed as Claire, this actor brings her kind of intense presence to the part. In fact, it is she who has the faintly raptorish presence, especially when her retrouss&eacute; nose is seen in profile. Owen, Claire and the horrible <em>Indominus Rex</em> make quite a team. It’s a world of fear and

This, I hasten to add, is not because we were both bird enthusiasts, but because I was rushing to finish the email and made an innocent typo.</p> \n<p>However, if a <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-02/the-best-e-mail-signature-is-actually-the-worst\" title=\"\">recent article</a> in Bloomberg Business is to be believed, it wasn’t the typo that was the worst thing about my sign-off; it was the “best”. According to the article, titled “You’re ending your e-mails wrong”, we’re all signing off our emails incorrectly because so many of us end them with “best”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Surely the ubiquity of the sign-off shows that it’s simply the best, better than all the rest?</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Back in 2003, studies showed that only 5% of emails ended that way. But recently “best” has apparently become “completely and unnecessarily ubiquitous”. Much as “everyone” now writes spurious trend pieces based on select anecdata, “everyone” now signs off their office emails with best.</p> \n<p>So what’s so wrong with that? Surely the ubiquity of the sign-off is a sign that it’s simply the best, better than all the rest, better than any other closing convention you’ve ever sent?</p> \n<p>Actually, no. “Best is benign,” <a href=\"http://www.selfgrowth.com/experts/judith_kallos.html\" title=\"\">Judith Kallos</a>, an email etiquette consultant (yes, this is an actual job), told Bloomberg. “It works when you apparently don’t know what else to use.” Unimaginative but inoffensive, formal but not too florid, the basic best has become the Starbucks of email signatures. It demonstrates a distinct lack of adjectival imagination. It screams that you can do bester. Worse still, according to one PR expert who chimed in on the matter, the ubiquity of the sign-off is part of a more malignant trend of <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-business/11659218/Work-email-Your-sign-off-is-vulgar-and-lazy.-Heres-how-to-do-it.html\" title=\"\">“vulgarised and lazy” language in emails</a>.</p> \n<p>I don’t mean to sound vulgar and lazy, but WTF? Honestly, does anyone really care how you sign off a work email? While some industries and etiquette experts may still cling to analogue conventions when navigating digital platforms, much of the business world has moved on. Arguing over whether “yours sincerely” is a more fitting email sign-off than “best wishes” or “yours faithfully” or your spirit animal as represented in emoji is like fiddling while Rome burns its email servers and moves towards a new generation of messaging platforms such as <a href=\"http://www.theverge.com/2014/8/12/5991005/slack-is-killing-email-yes-really\" title=\"\">Slack</a>. These tend to be more conversational and informal by design and have their own idiosyncratic rules of etiquette.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jan/18/it-used-to-be-rude-not-to-answer-michael-goves-mobile-phone-etiquette\">It used to be rude not to answer the phone. Now you’re rude if you do | David Mitchell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Constant connectivity also means that we’re treating email more like instant messaging, and that’s also changing the conventions we associate with it. After all, you don’t need a sign-off when you’ve never really signed off. Indeed, many people are now eschewing ending conventions altogether. The Bloomberg article is of this camp, and suggests that the right way to end your emails is now simply with a full stop. While this makes sense, there’s also something rather sad and transactional about abandoning the complimentary closing altogether. Rather than becoming “vulgarised and lazy”, it appears that language in our emails is simply becoming more efficient and boring.</p> \n<p>Besides, it won’t be too long before much of the content of our emails is being suggested for us by algorithms with content, tone and sign-off expertly tailored to the recipient. There is already a site called <a href=\"https://www.crystalknows.com/home\" title=\"\">Crystal</a> that runs <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2015/04/write-perfect-email-anyone-creepy-site/\" title=\"\">“proprietary personality detection technology”</a> to help you write the perfect email to anyone. When this sort of technology is implemented at scale, I’m afraid the email etiquette consultancy industry will be in for a devastating downturn.</p> \n<p>So, while debates over the relative merits of a “best” versus a “regards” may seem like a semantic storm in an e-cup, I say enjoy this vulgarised laziness while it lasts. Pretty soon the robots will take over and we’ll be enjoying perfectly tailored sign-offs that are typo-free.</p> \n<p>Brest, Arwa</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433939281078/Womans-hands-on-a-compute-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Best has become the Starbucks of email signatures.

The parents’ educational background is showing more and more in their grades.</p> \n<p>“Instead of breaking up social differences and class differences in the education system, we have a system today that’s creating a wider gap between the ones that have and the ones that have not.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-0e3e39e6-3c0c-45a8-90a9-b0fa287cefbe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433936989473/52bb38fc-2a88-4828-be95-53f116293a9b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gustav Fridolin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gustav Fridolin (front left) with his prime minister, Stefan Lofven, and cabinet colleagues in October 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: TT/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sweden’s decline follows a raft of changes in the late 1980s and early 1990s that transformed the educational landscape. A system that had been largely centralised was devolved to municipalities, teacher training was changed, exams and grades changed, and a voucher system was introduced giving parents the power to choose which school to send their child to. Each child was funded by the state, and if the child chose to go do a different school, the money would follow.</p> \n<p>Since then, almost 800 publicly funded private schools – or free schools – have been set up across Sweden, many of them by companies who are allowed to make a profit. In England, the education secretary, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/forprofit-schools-have-no-place-in-britain-says-tory-education-secretary-nicky-morgan-10257148.html\">Nicky Morgan</a>, has ruled out allowing free schools to be run for profit. This is one of key concerns in the current education debate in Sweden. </p> \n<p>Critics on the left in Sweden blame the voucher system for declining results, saying it has opened the door for schools more interested in making a profit than providing education. Conservatives who support free choice say students have been given too much influence in the classroom, undermining the authority of teachers.</p> \n<p>Fridolin’s line is that it was not one single change that caused the problems, but a combination that helped create a “fragmentary school system” which lacked steering and sowed the seeds for growing inequality.<br /></p> \n<p>“The school system is not a market where everyone has the same possibilities and the same information. It becomes that some parents, the educated parents with strong resources, use the possibility to choose schools.”</p> \n<p>His government’s aim, he says, is to make sure that public money spent in schools stays in schools. But it will not be easy. “It’s a genie-in-the-bottle situation. How do we change a system that has gone on so long in allowing quite big profit in schools?”</p> \n<p>Fridolin has a fight on his hands. On the opposing side is Barbara Bergstr&ouml;m, founder and chair of Internationella Engelska Skolan (IES), one of the largest providers of free schools in Sweden. IES currently educates 20,000 pupils in 30 schools across Sweden. Its success is such that a further 94,000 children are on its waiting lists, some as young as three weeks have their names down for a place.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7dfc45b9c22b9d3b0f48389ed3d9cc06e4939275\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433936966217/48944cd1-6422-42ca-86b1-710189d95c9a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Barbara Bergstr&ouml;m\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara Bergstr&ouml;m, founder and chair of Internationella Engelska Skolan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arni Torfason/Demotix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We meet in the polished corridors of the first IES school to open, in Enskede, a suburb of Stockholm. It’s almost the end of term and many of the children are going to visit museums around the city. The school is orderly, the pupils courteous – the regime is stricter than in many of Sweden’s state schools – and results are strong, exceeding those of neighbouring municipal schools.</p> \n<p>“This is more organised than my last school,” says one 12-year-old girl. “It was all relaxing on the table there.”</p> \n<p>“In my last school they were really messy,” says her friend. “They didn’t really listen to the teachers. Here it’s more respectful.”</p> \n<p>When Gove visited this school he liked what he saw, and when Bergstr&ouml;m met him in London later he asked her: “How many schools are you going to open in the UK? A hundred, 200?”</p> \n<p>In fact IES has opened just one, IES Breckland, in Brandon, Suffolk, which was placed in special measures by Ofsted but is now making “reasonable progress”. Bergstr&ouml;m, a former science teacher from Buffalo, New York, says there will be no more schools in England for the time being.</p> \n<p>She has had meetings with Fridolin. “There’s an awful lot of rhetoric about for-profit companies. If we were not for profit we would not be where were we are today. There’s no way we would be able to do what we are doing in our schools without the security of a solid financial base.”</p> \n<p>Ulla Hamilton, chief executive of the Swedish Association for Independent Schools, agrees. “The market is working,” she says. The theory is that competition forces flagging schools to up their game. </p> \n<p>She says the decline in Sweden’s schools has nothing to do with the introduction of free choice or the emergence of independent schools. Hamilton quotes research by the IFAU, the Swedish Institute for Evaluation of Labour Market and Education Policy, which suggests that results had started to drop even before the changes. “The free schools are not the cause,” she says.</p> \n<p>But as the postmortem continues into what has gone wrong in Sweden’s education system, the free school movement is faltering. Because of the uncertainty about the future, fewer companies are coming forward to open new schools, banks are afraid to provide loans, and the numbers being approved to set up schools is going down. Meanwhile, waiting lists for places in many of Sweden’s independent schools are going up.</p> \n<p>Like Bergstr&ouml;m, Hamilton is in favour of profit. “You need to be able to make a margin otherwise people will not be interested in setting up,” she says. She adds that the payback for shareholders is tiny compared with public preconceptions.</p> \n<p>There are no profits at Frejaskolan, a state school in Gnesta, just south of Stockholm. There’s a happy, informal atmosphere (uniforms are unheard of in Sweden, in any school) but in the last two years a small number of parents have chosen to take their children out and put them in an independent school 25 miles away.</p> \n<p>“The parents know about the school,” says one of the teachers. “It stands up quite well. There’s good marketing. When they go, we lose the money we get from the state. I’m a parent myself and I’m a little bit worried. </p> \n<p>“My youngest is 10 years old. Will she have teachers who are really qualified? We don’t really know how it will be.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian asked Andreas Schleicher, the OECD’s director for education and skills, what lessons the UK might learn from the Swedish experience. He said: “When establishing school autonomy and choice, the Swedish system did not strengthen oversight and intervention functions (which were traditionally weak in Sweden). So the system had no means to learn from successful schools and scale their success, and it had no means to detect and address educational underperformance.</p> \n<p>“I think the UK needs to watch out for that as well, unless it is willing and able to upscale Ofsted by dimensions. Successful school systems are more than a collection of independent schools.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943031056/2e61ef3e-b976-4b8f-b334-5e662f9132c6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Arni Torfason/Demotix","altText":"Students at the Swedish free school.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Arni Torfason/Demotix"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433936474512/d0d12650-6288-451b-bde2-f70790f11ae6-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gustav Fridolin (front left) with his prime minister, Stefan Lofven, and cabinet colleagues in October 2014.

Two opposing answers to that question are battling it out in London right now. The first is pedestrian, traditional: it says that a house is fundamentally a home.

London’s most expensive block, where flats go for up to &pound;140m apiece, it juts out of Knightsbridge. Qatari money paid for its building. Russians, Kazakhs, and Ukrainians have bought apartments there – although how many of them live there is up for debate. A 2011 investigation by our sister paper the Observer revealed that only nine of the 62 homes then sold in the block <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2011/nov/26/one-hyde-park-council-tax\">were registered for council tax</a> – and five of those were paying the half-price reduced levy for second homes. The following year, journalists at the Guardian found that 80% of the residences had been bought by offshore firms based <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2012/nov/26/one-hyde-park-british-virgin-islands\">in the British Virgin Islands</a>.</p> \n<p>Some might look at One Hyde Park and see a temple to wealth, an enclave of the super-rich. They’re partly right – but the building is also a state of the art financial instrument, bought tax-efficiently by some of the world’s biggest holders of flight capital. Allow me to say this very gently, so as not to give the Guardian’s lawyers palpitations, but not all the money invested in that building may have been earned in the sense normally understood by earthlings such as you and me.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/08/candy-brothers-one-hyde-park-tax\">Revealed: the video the Candy brothers' tax adviser didn't want you to see</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s against that background that we should read <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/08/candy-brothers-one-hyde-park-tax\">the latest revelations</a> about Christian Candy of One Hyde Park. As today’s story shows, who Candy is depends entirely on whether you believe his advisers – or the words that spring from his own mouth and those of his closest colleagues. So he talks like one of the property developers for the luxury flats – but was not one of the property developers, no sir. He is a UK tax exile, who has apparently been coming to the UK every week for the past five years. He appeared to help pick the contractors for the project, like a property developer would – but was not a property developer. Which version of events one is told seems to depend rather a lot on whether one might have something to do with Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.</p> \n<p>The reason Christian Candy should have chosen his words very carefully is because he heads another part of the brothers’ empire, the part based in the tax haven of Guernsey – the most profitable bit to do with developing and flogging properties. Elder brother Nick Candy supposedly does the interior design and project management, based in the UK. Except that, as the unedited video obtained by the Guardian suggests, the roles are not so cut and dried as all that.</p> \n<p>One Hyde Park is just a block of flats, supposedly a set of homes. But it is also a tax-efficient financial instrument, developed and managed by a couple of brothers who are themselves engaged in complicated financial planning to ensure they pay as little tax as possible to this country. Even though they rely on British law and order to protect their property and the deals made on it. Even though they studied at British universities – at a time when British students paid no tuition fees (perhaps now may be a good time to remind ourselves that Christian Candy <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2014/oct/20/candy-brothers-nick-christian-property-tycoons-brand-opulence\">named his twins</a> Isabella Monaco Evanthia and Cayman Charles Wolf).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-membership element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/guardian-live-how-do-we-solve-the-london-housing-crisis-with-diane-abbott-simon-jenkins-and-others-16912350295\">Guardian Live: How do we solve the London housing crisis?

Opting out of the society one is part of, opting out of paying one’s taxes to the UK Treasury. I visited One Hyde Park in its early days. Once past the top-hatted doorman, I went up eight floors in a glass lift, then into a flat decorated with statues of big cats and with a verandah that would enable its owner to breakfast above Knightsbridge. The publicist pointed out the marble worktops in the “family” kitchen, and then the second kitchen behind it where one’s staff would do the actual cooking. There was round-the-clock room service, she explained: “When you’re flying back to London, you just ring ahead and ask for someone to turn down your bed.”</p> \n<p>It struck me as a pied a terre for a private-jet capitalists, and it would have bothered me less were it not in a city where over a quarter of a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-rents-lettings-and-tenancies\">million households are waiting for a council flat</a>. One Hyde Park is in the borough of Westminster, where half the households waiting for social housing are now homeless. Public-housing provision in Westminster is so thin that the council is now infamous for dumping tenants in need of an emergency home <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2014/dec/11/homeless-families-out-of-area-temporary-accommodation-rent-housing-benefit-cap-shelter\">into outer London</a>.</p> \n<p>As I say, there are two versions of what a house is for now at war in the capital. I still have the old-fashioned, corduroy answer that a house is a home.

It’s been announced that, in the first episode of the 27th Simpsons series, Homer will fall in love with a pharmacist played by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/culture/lena-dunham\">Lena Dunham</a>, and that’ll be the end of their marriage.</p> \n<p>As Simpsons executive producer Al Jean told Variety, “In the premiere, it’s discovered after all the years Homer has narcolepsy and it’s an incredible strain on the marriage. Homer and Marge legally separate, and Homer falls in love with his pharmacist, who’s voiced by Lena Dunham. We’ll have cameos from the other <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/girls\">women from Girls</a>.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/14/can-the-simpsons-survive-without-harry-shearer\">Can The Simpsons survive without Harry Shearer?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This news is nothing short of a full-blown tragedy. Homer and Marge Simpson have been married for years. Quite how many years is a slightly confusing matter – they got married in the early 1980s and then permanently stopped ageing in the late 1980s, which means that they’ve either been together for 10 or 35 years – but that’s not really the point. We’ve always looked to Homer and Marge Simpson for stability in troubled times, and now they’re crashing apart on the rocks. How could The Simpsons do this to us?</p> \n<p>Well, truth be told, they aren’t. Anyone who has grimly clung on through the dregs that latter-day Simpsons episodes have flung at us are perfectly used to this level of nonsense by now. New episodes aren’t even episodes any more, simply delivery systems for desperate, promotional non-stories. Remember last September, when everyone briefly got their knickers in a twist when The Simpsons announced that it would kill off a long-serving character, and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/sep/29/who-died-on-the-simpsons-and-did-the-family-guy-crossover-work\">it ended up being Krusty’s dad</a>? Remember what a disappointment that was? This is going to be exactly the same.<br /></p> \n<p>I guarantee that the legal separation will happen, and be permanently resolved, within the space of a single episode. This isn’t Maude Flanders dying. It isn’t <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/simpsons-retires-marcia-wallaces-edna-687154\">Marcia Wallace dying</a>. It’s barely even a nudge on from the Viva Ned Flanders episode from 1999, where Homer got drunk and married a cocktail waitress – something ostensibly bad happened; 10 minutes later it was fixed; a week after that, it was forgotten for ever. This will just be a repeat of that, with the added bonus of an annoyingly voiced pharmacist.</p> \n<p>This is what The Simpsons has become now. It’s gone from a show that disappoints you when it airs a repeat to a show that disappoints you when it airs a new episode. Gradually, over the space of decade, the primary function of The Simpsons has been to remind you that it still exists. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9a92daa8d458b67e2b61a9266cdbc0f6939155d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433928643529/b3b82efb-b8b6-470f-a789-e0c2e8484918-460x193.jpeg\" alt=\"Don't worry, Spider Pig is coming back too…\" width=\"460\" height=\"193\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Don’t worry, Spider Pig is coming back too …</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20TH CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another widely reported plot point from the new series, for example, is Sideshow Bob finally murdering Bart Simpson (albeit within the confines of a Treehouse of Horror episode). And, just to underline once and for all that the entire caravan is running on fumes, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=714-Ioa4XQw\">Spider Pig is coming back</a>. Spider Pig, the unfunny Jar Jar Binks figure from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2007/jul/24/animation.family\">an eight-year-old film</a> that still managed to come out long after The Simpsons had gone off the boil.</p> \n<p>Surely this is it for the series now? It can’t have much longer left. It’s one thing to lose a cast member, but it’s another thing to lose the spark that made the show so beloved in the first place. Crowbarring apart the programme’s central relationship – even temporarily – in the name of ratings is a step too far. Forget Homer and Marge, maybe it’s time the rest of us became legally separated from The Simpsons.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433930834842/adcdc9b6-bc1c-4acf-b633-3b0e81660414-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sky/Chris Buck","altText":"Is Lena Dunham the person that finally comes between Homer and Marge for good?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sky/Chris Buck"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433928642833/b3b82efb-b8b6-470f-a789-e0c2e8484918-1020x427.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":427,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Don’t worry, Spider Pig is coming back too … Photograph: Allstar/20TH CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","credit":"Allstar/20TH CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","altText":"Don't worry, Spider Pig is coming back too…","cleanCaption":"Don’t worry, Spider Pig is coming back too …","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Allstar/20TH CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T10:34:51Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T11:24:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":135,"contributors":[{"name":"Stuart Heritage","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749780/StuartHeritage.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stuart-heritage"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["The Simpsons","Animation","Television & radio","Culture","US television","Television","Lena Dunham"],"tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/the-simpsons","webTitle":"The Simpsons"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/animation","webTitle":"Animation"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/us-television","webTitle":"US television"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"culture/lena-dunham","webTitle":"Lena Dunham"}],"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stuart Heritage","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stuart-heritage"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"tv-and-radio"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/10/doh-homer-simpson-leaves-marge-for-lena-dunham-for-one-episode","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49k6h","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/10/doh-homer-simpson-leaves-marge-for-lena-dunham-for-one-episode","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/10/doh-homer-simpson-leaves-marge-for-lena-dunham-for-one-episode"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433930834842/adcdc9b6-bc1c-4acf-b633-3b0e81660414-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Is Lena Dunham the person that finally comes between Homer and Marge for good?

Inclusive jokes are about the human condition, so we can all share that kind of humour.

His flawless deadpan humour and sudden bursts of violent indignation were later put to good use in Fawlty Towers – still considered the perfect sitcom by many – and in films from A Fish Called Wanda to a pair of Bond movies.</p> \n<p>Recently, he has voiced animated movies including Planes and two helpings of Shrek, appeared with his old Monty Python gang in a sellout run at London’s O2 and in the forthcoming film Absolutely Anything, and staged a solo show – rather bitterly dubbed The Alimony Tour, to reflect his divorce settlement with his ex-wife. </p> \n<p>It’s all gone into his new autobiography <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/so-anyway.html\">So, Anyway …</a>, and with its publication in paperback this month he’s joining us for a live webchat to answer your questions.

We all want to laugh, but we need to understand that humour is nearly always critical, even if it's just critical of something harmless like stupidity.

Inclusive jokes are about the human condition, so we can all share that kind of humour.

There’s one difference: rather than a van, the 29-year-old is filling a large box on a cargo bike.</p> \n<p>“It’s really easy to ride,” he says of the <a href=\"http://8freight.com/\">two-wheeled, tandem-length machine</a>, with the lidded container positioned between the saddle and the rear wheel. “You get used to it pretty quickly, and it’s still small enough to filter through traffic.”</p> \n<p>Cartwright, who recently completed a PhD in archaeology at Cambridge University, has spent the past eight months piloting the unusual contraption through the city for <a href=\"http://www.outspokendelivery.co.uk/wp/\">Outspoken Delivery</a>, one of a fast-growing breed of logistics companies eschewing the motor vehicle in favour of pedal power.</p> \n<p>Outspoken’s fleet comprises around a dozen cargo bikes and trikes of various sizes, going up to behemoths able to carry loads of more than 200kg, some with a small electric motor helping the rider set off from lights or negotiate Cambridge’s very occasional slight hills.</p> \n<p>Rob King, the founder, said it was initially a struggle to persuade customers to sign up: “We’d go into companies and say, ‘We could do these deliveries.’ They’d say, ‘Don’t be ridiculous, you’re on bikes.’”</p> \n<p>Outspoken, whose riders wear uniforms and take the <a href=\"https://bikeability.org.uk/\">Bikeability training scheme</a>, now has a big client list, including sub-contracted work from major freight companies, as well as new outlets in Glasgow and Norwich.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c37fc53dddd1be8d6eb9be3dcf3e8b652f360349\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431691240852/bb6152cf-6c85-4946-a7da-55e93bd10dcc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Outspoken Delivery in Cambridge \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cargo bikes are especially useful in towns and cities where some roads are closed to cars and vans.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Rogers for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The obvious point with cargo bikes is that they are not meant as a complete replacement for the truck or van. Cargo bikes would struggle to take a washing machines, let alone a sofa, and can’t shuttle big loads between nationwide depots. Where they come into their own is the so-called last mile deliveries, particularly the vast number of smaller packages from online purchases.</p> \n<p>They are especially effective in compact, congested towns and cities, where a cargo bike rider, unworried by parking tickets and able to use bike-only routes, can often deliver more packages in a day than their van-driving equivalent, even with the smaller payload requiring occasional returns to the depot. </p> \n<p>This is all the more so in places such as Cambridge, where <a href=\"http://www.cambridgeshire.gov.uk/info/20018/parking_permits_and_fines/9/parking/3\">parts of the centre are closed to cars and vans</a>. And of course, cargo bikes are nearly emission-free and much safer for a city’s inhabitants.</p> \n<p>There are cargo bike delivery firms in about a dozen places around the UK, and many more across continental Europe, carrying everything from Amazon packages to office stationery to takeaway food.</p> \n<p>There is even an EU-funded project, <a href=\"http://cyclelogistics.eu/\">Cycle Logistics</a>, seeking to boost the trade. Susanne Wrighton from <a href=\"http://www.fgm.at/\">Forschungsgesellschaft Mobilit&auml;t</a>, a Vienna-based mobility thinktank involved in Cycle Logistics, says her city has a successful startup <a href=\"http://www.ritabringts.at\">delivering healthy meals with a fleet of branded cargo bikes</a>. A <a href=\"https://www.ordr.cz/\">takeaway food enterprise in Prague</a> promises its bikes can deliver the dish of choice within seven minutes of order.</p> \n<p>There is more to the fast growth of the industry than convenience, says Wrighton: “It’s also a matter of more and more cities recognising that this can really improve the quality of life for people who live in the city.”</p> \n<p>Aside from a generally bike-unfriendly road culture, the UK industry was also impeded by regulations meaning heavier cargo bikes fitted with electric assistance were classified as motor vehicles.</p> \n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/24/pdfs/uksi_20150024_en.pdf\">restriction was lifted in April</a>, although the electric motors remain small – a maximum of 250w power – and limited to 15mph. Outspoken is now awaiting delivery of a vast, electric-assisted cargo trike with a three cubic-metre cargo box, almost as large as a small van. </p> \n<p>An electric boost is even more of a boon in hilly towns and cities. Staff at <a href=\"http://www.rechargecargo.co.uk/\">ReCharge</a>, a courier company launched in Brighton by another former PhD student, Sam Keam, in 2013, use electrically-assisted bikes to deliver goods ranging from sub-contracted DHL packages to bottles from a wine merchant.</p> \n<p>While local companies enjoy the green cachet of using cargo bikes, said Keam, for bigger clients it is convenience that counts: “We’re seeing growth in parts of the British economy, retail is moving online and the number of deliveries being made is going through the roof. But there’s no road space for that to happen. The only way you can grow urban economies is by changing the way you manage logistics in a city.”</p> \n<p>Deliveries by bike are, of course, a longstanding urban phenomenon, with cycle couriers a familiar sight in many big cities for decades. But as fax and then email have hacked away at this trade other businesses are stepping in.</p> \n<p>At the start of this year Richa Bhalla, a 27-year-old former tech industry worker, launched <a href=\"http://petalandcycle.co.uk/\">Petal and Cycle</a>, a florist that promises to deliver bouquets to addresses in central London addresses by bike within 90 minutes.</p> \n<p>Customers enjoy both the immediacy and the method, Bhalla said: “It’s nice to have this human contact. There’s a kind of symbolism to it, kind of like this knight in shining armour, pedalling across the city to bring you flowers.”</p> \n<p>One company, however, remains missing: Royal Mail. The UK’s biggest parcel deliverer of all has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/bike-blog/2013/dec/09/royal-mail-post-bikes\">phased out almost all its familiar delivery bikes</a>, replacing them with vans and trollies. The company says it has tried cargo bikes but found none “capable of meeting our needs”.</p> \n<p>As well as the shift from letters to parcels, Royal Mail also stopped using bikes <a href=\"http://road.cc/content/news/16001-safety-concerns-prime-reason-behind-phasing-out-royal-mail-bikes\">over safety fears</a>. That is perhaps another lesson for the cargo bike industry: it might only become completely mainstream when more areas become cycle friendly.</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431622329645/1e363716-e11d-4723-ac8a-0862970f8c26-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Paul Rogers for the Guardian","altText":"Outspoken Delivery in Cambridge","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Paul Rogers for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431691242122/bb6152cf-6c85-4946-a7da-55e93bd10dcc-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Cargo bikes are especially useful in towns and cities where some roads are closed to cars and vans.
