Inside this huge wooden drum, dashing black-clad chaps on motorbikes go full throttle so they can cling to its vertical walls. “Look!” shouts the spieler, “side-saddle riding with no hands!”</p> \n<p>At the height of its popularity in the 1960s, when it attracted more than two million thrill-seekers a year, Dreamland boasted a wall of death run by legendary stunt motorcyclist Yvonne Stagg. I never knew it firsthand, only through Lindsay Anderson’s unsettling 1953 documentary film, O Dreamland, with its terrifying animatronic electric chair and Haunted Snail ride.</p> \n<p>The park closed, seemingly forever, in 2003, but here it is, a candy-striped phoenix, saved from being turned over to featureless residential properties by the indomitable energies of The Dreamland Trust, aided by a dramatic CPO by Thanet District Council and, now, private backing. The Grade II-listed scenic railway, devastated by an arson attack in 2008, has been rebuilt, wooden slat by wooden slat, back to its rickety, grinding glory. Though sadly, the restoration wasn’t finished quite in time for opening last weekend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84c3d2ca05ce7b092f2ec2ce7701f94da457ae6c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063380541/d31ef1a5-f277-46f4-8a8b-89899099d2ec-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Messhams Wall of Death\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Defying gravity … Messhams Wall of Death provides traditional thrills</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On my first visit, I go along with Rob Ball, a photographer who has created a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/gallery/2015/jun/08/margate-dreamland-amusement-park-tintype-photographs-in-pictures\">series of haunting, tintype photographs of the park during its transition</a>. He knew it in the late 1990s when it was “more like a travelling fair, everything seemed temporary and a bit broken. It was like Margate at the time – lacking any kind of energy”.</p> \n<p>Energy it now has in spades. The staff, in their vintage Levi’s 501s, denim overalls and jaunty 1950s-style bandanas – are bursting with sugar-rush enthusiasm. Their T-shirts bellow fairground-speak: “Scream if you want to go faster”, “Hands in the air”, “We cater for pleasure”, a riff on the original strapline, Pleasure Without Measure. My first teenage, um, stirrings took place on the waltzers, and I’m delighted to see that the long-haired, tattooed ride-wrangler aesthetic is still in place, even if it’s softened by the seaside rock palette. More than 200 new jobs have been created, mostly for locals: Dreamland is already contributing significantly to Margate’s steady revival.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d42d408181c611e9fc781b5d2d1713a04700f51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063602994/f822f6cc-8730-4a69-b2b6-46e9d4af7510-359x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The brick edifice of the art deco cinema\" width=\"359\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The brick edifice of the art deco cinema</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One entrance is via the imposing, brick-fronted building, off the seafront parade of arcades and pubs and the striking, fin-fronted art deco cinema. This brings you past The Emporium, bristling with superior souvenirs, many designed by local artists, such as <a href=\"http://www.zoemurphy.com/\">Zoe Murphy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.keithbrymerjones.com/537/about-keith-brymer-jones\">Keith Brymer Jones</a>. There’s also retro furniture from <a href=\"http://junkdeluxe.co.uk/\">Junk Deluxe</a>, including decorative items crafted from pieces of the original scenic railway. You’re immediately in the heart of the hubbub: a glorious tin-tiled ceiling left in decoratively peeling state soars over roller-disco, bar, acres of neon – including a wonderful artwork by Ramsgate-based artist <a href=\"http://www.rachelwilberforce.com/\">Rachel Wilberforce</a> – and banks of original pinball machines. You can also go in via an entrance under the rollercoaster – I can only imagine how exciting this will be when the cars are rumbling above your head.</p> \n<p>Once, Dreamland was at the cutting edge of fairground excitement. But now it has a whole other agenda: rather than competing with the high-tech thrills of Alton Towers and Thorpe Park, it offers a gentle, sweetly retro vision of seaside fun masterminded by designer <a href=\"http://houseofhemingway.co.uk/hemingway-design/projects/dreamland/\">Wayne Hemingway</a>. Old rides have been refurbished, old fairground paraphernalia upcycled. But your hair will still be raised: 17 rides are currently open, more than enough for a day out, ranging from the vintage galloper merry-go-round, its handsome, brightly painted steeds performing a stately dance, to the hectic, waltzer-meets-rollercoaster swoops of the Crazy Mouse which has us screaming like hopped-up teenagers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62b7a4aa9c2815cc1480c513269787db2954a0a6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063878076/583de9ec-a223-453c-815f-0e2b6c5592bc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dreamland helter-skelter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dreamland is not aiming to compete with the likes of hi-tech Thorpe Park and Alton Towers</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Design is a huge part of it: you don’t need to notice that the teacups ride has been painted by a Wedgewood artist in classic Jasperware style – but with cultural icons from mods and rockers to new romantics. Or that the original dodgems have been repainted with David Bowie and Chuck Berry. But if you do, it adds an extra layer of pleasure.</p> \n<p>It costs &pound;14.95 for a pre-booked daily ticket (&pound;17.95 on the day), a price that has caused some local chuntering. My friend Jane remembers hanging out there every Saturday evening when entry was free, you only had to pay for rides. “As a 14-year-old, it was the only place to go – in all senses.” But I think the pricing is fair: your daily wristband allows you to go in and out as you please. So you can take time out for art at the <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/\">Turner Contemporary</a>, or to mooch round the indie shops of the Old Town – some of which, like vintage clothes specialist <a href=\"http://www.madampopoff.com/\">Madam Popoff</a>, are capitalising on Dreamland’s arrival by offering discounts to customers with wristbands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2df334c18f549fc16caffb44b929407f6659e02\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435064170608/0a93940f-fbef-49d1-8c28-3ed971d8d22d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The careful restoration of old arcade games has been part of Dreamland's redevelopment.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The careful restoration of old arcade games has been part of Dreamland’s redevelopment.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Stothard/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The one element that’s not floating my swing boat is the food. The food court looks attractive, fringed by herb-filled planters made from more reclaimed rollercoaster. But the only local presences I detect are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yamasmargate?fref=nf\">Yama’s Thai</a> (closed during our visit) and <a href=\"http://propercoffeehouse.co.uk/\">Proper Coffee</a>. Despite being served from a gleaming Airstream caravan, my cheeseburger is last century in a bad way: greasy, a stranger to quality meat products, topped with sweaty cheese. At &pound;4.50, it’s not cheap – and it nearly makes a second appearance after one too many turns on the dizzying Chair-O-Planes. I’m not sure, either, why the (expensive) ice-cream concession is by the Cotswold-based <a href=\"http://www.marshfield-icecream.co.uk/\">Marshfield Farm</a> when there’s the likes of <a href=\"http://www.morellisgelato.com/heritage\">Morelli’s</a>, which was founded in Broadstairs, nearby. So on my second visit, I use my wristband to trot out to newly opened <a href=\"http://www.hantverk-found.co.uk/\">Hantverk &amp; Found</a> (18 King St), a tiny seafood cafe and gallery, for gorgeous local seafood dishes and a clever winelist. It’s great to see outside tables at <a href=\"http://greatbritishpizza.com/margate-contact-us/\">GB Pizza</a> (14A Marine Drive) and <a href=\"http://bebeached.co.uk/\">BeBeached</a> (Harbour Arm) mobbed, too.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"200fdd4bdf551c19e35c343e9df5cbcf0ab57929\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435064465365/e2f2d7cf-e9f8-4578-84a3-0cefefcb657e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Margate is set for an influx this summer with Dreamland added to the town’s other recently opened attractions\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margate is set for an influx this summer with Dreamland added to the town’s other recently opened attractions</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But this is early days, phase one of four, promising over the next couple of years everything from a “fine dining” restaurant to the revival of the cinema and ballroom. The mood is fantastic: upbeat, from a crowd of older locals reliving their youth to cool young thangs attracted by Margate’s burgeoning reputation as Dalston-sur-Mer; fiftysomething men in braces and Harringtons, candy-floss-chomping teens… People are picnicking on the fake lawn beside the hair and beauty caravan, children gyrating newly bought hula-hoops to the strains of I’ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts. Elsewhere, drag queens in Hi-de-Hi! outfits groove to Blondie by the original 1940s toy car circuit, and a magician enthrals a crowd by the helter-skelter. Yes, there’s still work to be done. And some of the attractions – that Wall of Death, for instance – may not be permanent. But it’s already wonderful and it’s going to get even better. Lucky old Margate.</p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063099130/7a30786e-414b-469c-b777-ed6b95070a49-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Marc Sethi/PR","altText":"Dreamland, Margate","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Marc Sethi/PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063381956/d31ef1a5-f277-46f4-8a8b-89899099d2ec-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Defying gravity … Messhams Wall of Death provides traditional thrills","credit":"PAUL WEBB/PR","altText":"Messhams Wall of Death","cleanCaption":"Defying gravity … Messhams Wall of Death provides traditional thrills"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063600605/f822f6cc-8730-4a69-b2b6-46e9d4af7510-1745x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1745,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"The brick edifice of the art deco cinema","credit":"PR","altText":"The brick edifice of the art deco cinema","cleanCaption":"The brick edifice of the art deco cinema"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063879475/583de9ec-a223-453c-815f-0e2b6c5592bc-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dreamland is not aiming to compete with the likes of hi-tech Thorpe Park and Alton Towers Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters","credit":"Dylan Martinez/Reuters","altText":"Dreamland helter-skelter","cleanCaption":"Dreamland is not aiming to compete with the likes of hi-tech Thorpe Park and Alton Towers","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435064172055/0a93940f-fbef-49d1-8c28-3ed971d8d22d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The careful restoration of old arcade games has been part of Dreamland’s redevelopment.

In particular, his fury is directed at the MP3 download and its accomplice in crime, the iPod. Listening to music held on a tiny digital file through headphones or computer speakers accounts – says Shakey – for contemporary music’s “loss of soul”. Thus, Young poured his money into the Pono system, a “high-resolution” music service that he claimed would “rescue the art form that I’ve been practising for the last 50 years”. He previewed the launch with an album described by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/may/22/neil-young-a-letter-home-review\">the Guardian’s reviewer</a> as “arguably the lowest-fidelity album ever made by a major artist … muffled, distorted and buried beneath layers of crackle and hiss”. A Letter Home was created in the least expensive studio-like environment ever – a restored 1947 Voice-O-Graph booth (a fairground attraction which allowed users to take home a vinyl record of their voice). When the PonoPlayer finally arrived this January, the 24-bit, 192 kHz-sound, wallet-draining system was variously described as “making a dramatic difference” to the way we hear music or “<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://gizmodo.com/dont-buy-what-neil-young-is-selling-1678446860\">junk science</a>” – which presumably made Shakey apoplectic too. </p> \n<h2>Motoring</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b8a75fff844d270c050e66da564208d674fdc8b2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435078745691/f8739bb6-bad7-451e-9e91-ccd911e6bdfa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Neil Young with LincVolt mark one in 2010\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Young with LincVolt mark one in 2010, shortly before it was damaged in a fire.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vallery Jean/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Young isn’t the only environmentally aware human being bemoaning the cost to the earth of motoring’s reliance on fossil fuels and gas-guzzling cars. He has however, once again put his money where his mouth is, and developed <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.lincvolt.com/lincvolt_lincvoltgazette\">the Lincvolt</a>, a 1959 Lincoln Continental converted to run on biofuels or electricity. The goal – cue trumpet fanfare – is to “inspire a generation by creating a clean automobile-propulsion technology … to reduce the demand for petro-fuels enough to eliminate the need for war over energy supplies, thereby enhancing the security of nations throughout the world”.l Shakey helpfully explains: “You can plug it in at night and drive about 50 miles during the day if you drive very carefully, maybe about 35-40 if you drive like a maniac. And that’s kinda what I do.” Alas, after one of the car’s team left the charging system plugged in too long, the first such vehicle overheated and burned to the ground, taking an estimated $850,000 worth of Young’s memorabilia collection with it. Now that’s an expensive ride.</p> \n<h2>David Crosby </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d6a481fb9472c078bf15dbe63625784902658e4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435078845061/af977ae2-25a3-48ef-9a15-79faf4a9d654-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"David Crosby \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Crosby performing in June 2015.

Crosby then confirmed the situation, revealing: “Neil is very angry with me.” On this occasion, the precise source of Shakey’s ire remains unknown, although Croz perhaps upset him by wading into tricky personal waters during the media frenzy surrounding Young’s 2014 divorce from long-time wife, Pegi, and subsequent dalliance with actor Daryl Hannah. “I happen to know that he’s hanging out with somebody that’s a purely poisonous predator now — and that’s karma,” said the Croz. “He’s gonna get hurt.” Crosby later issued a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/david-crosby-apologizes-to-neil-young-daryl-hannah-20150518\">heartfelt apology</a> – presumably after he was hurting too. </p> \n<h2>Donald Trump </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdiCJUysIT0\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PdiCJUysIT0?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Neil Young – Rockin’ in the Free World\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite earlier being photographed together – <a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/06/neil-young-vs-donald-trump-9-songs-co-opted-by-clueless-politicians/\">all smiles</a>, at a Pono launch – Shakey was decidedly less than impressed when the climate-change-denying Republican kicked off the already beleaguered Trump-for-President campaign to the unlikely sound of Rockin’ in the Free World. Young initially issued a statement saying that use of his song was “not authorized”. Neil, being Neil, wouldn’t let it drop, and in a lengthy tirade on Facebook, the Canadian citizen widened his attack to take in not just Trump, but the entire US political system and corporate America. “Corporations don’t have children. They don’t have feelings or soul. They don’t depend on uncontaminated water, clean air or healthy food to survive,” he blasted. They don’t have the best tunes now either – since Young has subsequently given Rockin’ in the Free World to Trump’s avowed rival, Democrat Bernie Sanders. </p> \n<h2>Rude fans</h2> \n<p> Heckling is rarer at concerts nowadays, but it’s a brave fan who risks provoking the Young death glare. At a concert <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2pCYk1LjXs\">in Dallas</a>, the star had just begun to tell the audience a story about the instrument he was about to play when an impatient fan had the indignity to suggest he, y’know, just get on and play it. “I don’t think I am gonna play it,” said Young at first, triggering widespread laughter. However, other fans then joined in. “How about you talk and I’ll listen?” offered our rock’n’roller, quipping: “I’m trying to recall the last time I did what somebody told me what to do.” His ire was still simmering, however, during the subsequent Harvest Moon, a soft, tender ballad of which Young declared, “Funny. That song is not supposed to be angry,” while glaring at the crowd. </p> \n<h2>Starbucks </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22a4c86db07648d6c49fb4d312d6cd1cd6eedab4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435079170243/50312499-9168-476b-862e-7b50decd6c6a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Starbucks cups\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Starbucks will be getting no more latte money from Neil.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Chernin/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/oct/02/neil-young-classic-interview\">Neil Young: 'It gets spooky 'cause we were spooked' – a classic interview from the vaults</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Young is not best pleased at the world’s largest coffee chain either, as he made a statement on his website last year declaring “<a href=\"http://neilyoung.com/previous12.html\">Goodbye Starbucks</a>” and urging fans to follow his lead in boycotting the chain. This time, Shakey’s ire had been stoked by the corporate giant aligning itself with GM food company Monsanto in a lawsuit against the state of Vermont. Although the globalised coffee company <a href=\"https://news.starbucks.com/views/starbucks-response-to-questions-and-litigation-regarding-gmo-labeling\">later insisted</a> that they had nothing to do with this at all, and “has not taken a position on the issue of GMO labelling”,Young insisted: “You have the right to know what’s in your coffee”. He comparing the tiny rural state’s battle with the corporations as being like David versus Goliath, declaring Monsanto “the biggest villain of them all”. Perhaps the most striking aspect of this particular ruckus was Shakey’s admission that he “used to line up and get my latte every day”. The image of the great raging rocker queueing for a steamed milk concoction is not easily shaken off.</p> \n<h2>The Iraq war</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4kTnP5VJ1k\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k4kTnP5VJ1k?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Neil Young – Let’s Impeach the President\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Given his deeply held peace-and-love ideals, it would have been a surprise had Shakey not railed against the Iraq war, and he did not disappoint. In 2006, three years into the US-led invasion, Young was so upset by the triumphal tone of some newspaper coverage of wounded soldiers being flown to Germany that he cried. He also, true to form, got out his guitar, penning multiple songs criticising the Bush regime’s policy of warfare and associated human cost, culminating in one of his most withering protest songs ever, Let’s Impeach the President. Young admitted that it had been years since he’d crafted such angry music and in fact he’d deliberately held back – but had been moved to write by the lack of younger artists doing the same. He was probably furious at them as well.<br /></p> \n<h2>The Kent State shootings</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkg-bzTHeAk\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hkg-bzTHeAk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young – Ohio\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Perhaps the most famous and effective example of Young’s anger giving birth to a song came in 1970, after he saw photos in Life magazine of the fatal shootings by the Ohio National Guard of four unarmed students at Kent State University, during a protest against US involvement in Cambodia. That same evening, Young entered Record Plant Studio 3 in Hollywood and recorded one of the all-time great protest songs, Ohio, in just a few takes. Musically more sad than angry but lyrically ferocious even by his standards, the hit for Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young began: “Tin soldiers and Nixon coming / We’re finally on our own / This summer I hear the drumming / Four dead in Ohio.” Crosby, who reportedly cried at the recording, later described Young’s deliberate, withering reference of the president of the world’s most powerful nation by name as the “the bravest thing I ever heard”. Presumably Shakey wasn’t so angry at Croz in those days.</p> \n<h2>The Keystone XL oil pipeline </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkiRR3T_3NY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NkiRR3T_3NY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Neil Young – Who’s Gonna Stand Up\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was very little chance that Young would don a party hat over a proposed addition to an oil pipeline running all the way from Alberta in Canada to the southern US state of Texas. And still, this incident seems to have made our man more furious that ever. The rocker declared such pipelines “scabs on our lives” in November 2014, and compared the impact of the pipeline on Alberta’s oil sands to that of the Japanese city of Hiroshima after the US dropped the atomic bomb during the second world war. This brought another protest song, 2014’s Who’s Gonna Stand Up, and the lyric: “Ban fossil fuel and draw the line / Before we build one more pipeline.” Meanwhile, for his role in the episode, Canadian president Stephen Harper is “an embarrassment to many Canadians”, “a very poor imitation of George Bush”. Ouch.</p> \n<h2>Geffen Records</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OhS5WG9QbLM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OhS5WG9QbLM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Neil Young – Computer Age\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a well-worn story, but it’s always worth another airing. In the early 80s, Young signed to David Geffen’s new label, which expected – not unreasonably – that it would take delivery of more of the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh44QPT1mPE\">classic American rock records</a> that Young had made in the 1970s, such as Harvest and Tonight’s the Night. Instead, executives were rather alarmed when the first Young record for Geffen came in the electronic form of 1982’s Trans, an experimental synthesiser album which Young later explained was a reflection of his attempts to communicate with his young son, who was born with cerebral palsy. When Shakey then turned in Everybody’s Rockin’ – <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39VjfTW0Xys\">a rockabilly collection</a> – this was just too much for the incensed label, which sued him for the unprecedented and rather hilarious crime of delivering “unrepresentative” music – ie not sounding like Neil Young. Young counter-sued, claiming that his contract allowed artistic freedom, and won an apology. He recorded two more albums for Geffen, before returning to Reprise and delivering – yep, you guessed it, classic-sounding rock. Never let it be said that the angry great man doesn’t have a fantastically dry sense of humour. Meanwhile, anyone fearing for his blood pressure should take heed of his 2010 song <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4uDwvJK0YdI\">Angry World</a>, in which he assures us: “Some see life as a broken promise / Some see life as an endless fight … It’s an angry world, and everything is gonna be all right.”</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2012/10/2/1349177730726/Neil-Young---is-it-live-o-011.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty Images","altText":"Neil Young … is it live or is it Pono?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435078747019/f8739bb6-bad7-451e-9e91-ccd911e6bdfa-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Neil Young with LincVolt mark one in 2010, shortly before it was damaged in a fire.

Now he wants to share it with the world. What is behind this dark obsession? </p>","byline":"Alex Preston","body":"<p>When he was five years old, Kevin Wheatcroft received an unusual birthday present from his parents: a bullet-pocked SS stormtrooper’s helmet, lightning bolts on the ear-flaps. He had requested it especially. The next year, at a car auction in Monte Carlo, he asked his multimillionaire father for a Mercedes: the G4 that Hitler rode into the Sudetenland in 1938. Tom Wheatcroft refused to buy it and his son cried all the way home.</p> \n<p>When Wheatcroft was 15, he spent birthday money from his grandmother on three second world war Jeeps recovered from the Shetlands, which he restored himself and sold for a tidy profit. He invested the proceeds in four more vehicles, then a tank. After Wheatcroft left school at 16, he went to work for a Leicestershire engineering firm, and then for his father’s construction company. He spent his spare time touring wind-blasted battle sites in Europe and North Africa, searching for tank parts and recovering military vehicles that he would ship home to restore.</p> \n<p>Wheatcroft is now 55, and according to the Sunday Times Rich List, worth &pound;120m. He lives in Leicestershire, where he looks after the property portfolio of his late father and oversees the management of Donington Park Racetrack and motor museum (which he also owns). The ruling passion of his life, though, is what he calls the Wheatcroft Collection – widely regarded as the world’s largest accumulation of German military vehicles and Nazi memorabilia. The collection has largely been kept in<strong> </strong>private,<strong> </strong>under heavy guard, either in the warren of industrial buildings Wheatcroft owns near Market Harborough, or at his homes in Leicestershire, the Charente in south-west France and the Mosel Valley in south-west Germany. There is no official record of the value of Wheatcroft’s collection, but some estimates place it at over &pound;100m.</p> \n<p>Wheatcroft is a large, quiet man and a legend in the blokey, Clarksonish world of online military history obsessives. Among the internet tribes of second world war enthusiasts, the Wheatcroft Collection is spoken about in hushed, reverential tones – a near-mythical trove of military treasures. Now Wheatcroft, who has long been reluctant to publicise his vast archive of Nazi artefacts, is guardedly opening up his hoard to a wider audience, <a href=\"http://www.wheatcroftcollection.com/home.html\">launching a rather creaky website</a> and putting a handful of vehicles on display at his motor museum.</p> \n<p>Since that initial stormtrooper’s helmet, Wheatcroft’s life has been shaped by his obsession for German military memorabilia. He has travelled the world tracking down items to add to his collection, flying into remote airfields, following up unlikely leads, throwing himself into hair-raising adventures in the pursuit of historic <em>objets</em>. He readily admits that his urge to accumulate has been monomaniacal, elbowing out the demands of friends and family. The French theorist <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2007/mar/07/guardianobituaries.france\">Jean Baudrillard</a> once noted that collecting mania is found most often in “pre-pubescent boys and males over the age of 40”; the things we hoard, he wrote, tend to reveal deeper truths.</p> \n<p>Wheatcroft’s father, Tom, a building site worker from Castle Donington, came back from the second world war a hero. He also came back with a wife, Wheatcroft’s mother, Lenchen, whom he had first seen from the turret of a tank as he pulled into her village in the Harz mountains of Lower Saxony. He made hundreds of millions in the post-war building boom, then spent the rest of his life indulging his zeal for motor cars. He ran Donington Park racetrack and counted Ayrton Senna and Jean Manuel Fangio among his drinking buddies. He had his own race team – Wheatcroft Racing – and built up the world’s largest collection of racing cars.</p> \n<p>In his autobiography, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Thunder-Park-Story-Wheatcroft-Donington/dp/0954286057\">Thunder in the Park</a>, Tom Wheatcroft comes across as a tricky character, a cut-throat haggler and difficult husband. During the 1970s, Lenchen moved out of the family home for eight years after a period when Tom, in the bantery brogue of his memoir, “had not been quite so single-minded as far as my own family life was concerned”. Lenchen took Kevin and two of his sisters to live in nearby Market Harborough. While there was, eventually, a reconciliation, Kevin spent the majority of his adolescence apart from his war-hero father. Tom supported his son in his early years of collecting; Wheatcroft speaks of his late father as “not just my dad, but also my best friend”. Tom died in 2009. Despite being one of seven children, Wheatcroft was the sole beneficiary of his father’s will. He no longer speaks to his siblings.</p> \n<p>It is hard to say how much the echoes of atrocity that resonate from Nazi artefacts compel the enthusiasts who haggle for and hawk them.<strong> </strong>The trade in Third Reich antiquities is either banned or strictly regulated in Germany, France, Austria, Israel and Hungary. None of the major auction houses will handle Nazi memorabilia and eBay recently prohibited sales on its site. Still, the business flourishes, with burgeoning online sales and increasing interest from buyers in Russia, America and the Middle East; Wheatcroft’s biggest rival is a mysterious, unnamed Russian buyer.</p> \n<p>Naturally, exact figures are hard to come by, but the market’s annual global turnover is estimated to be in excess of &pound;30m.<strong> </strong>One of the most-visited websites is run by Holocaust denier David Irving, who in 2009 sold Hitler’s walking stick (which had previously belonged to Friedrich Nietzsche) for $5,750. Irving has offered strands of Hitler’s hair for &pound;130,000, and says he is currently verifying the authenticity of charred bones said to be those of Hitler and Eva Braun. There is also a roaring trade in the automobiles of the Third Reich – in 2009, one of Hitler’s Mercedes sold for almost &pound;5m. A signed copy of Mein Kampf will set you back &pound;20,000, while in 2011 an unnamed investor purchased Joseph Mengele’s South American journals for &pound;300,000.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"4310d0f22d3ab360ef18d30f94f4f6c3c040c0f5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063004134/e2401ae0-497c-4174-982d-f40e374fc147-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kevin Wheatcroft at home in Leicestershire, where he keeps one of the largest collections of German military vehicles and Nazi memorabilia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Wheatcroft at home in Leicestershire, where he keeps one of the largest collections of German military vehicles and Nazi memorabilia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As the crimes of the Nazi regime retreat further into the past, there seems to be an increasing desperation in the race to get hold of mementos of the darkest chapter of the 20th century. In the market for Nazi memorabilia, two out of the three principal ideologies of the era – fascism and capitalism – collide, with the mere financial value of these objects used to justify their acquisition, the spiralling prices trapping collectors in a frantic race for the rare and the covetable. In Walden, Henry David Thoreau observed that “the things we own can own us too”; this is the sense I get with Wheatcroft – that he started off building a collection, but that very quickly the collection began building him.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>When I went to Leicestershire</strong> near the end of last year to see the collection, a visibly tired Wheatcroft met me off the train at Market Harborough. “I want people to see this stuff,”<strong> </strong>he told me. “There’s no better way to understand history. But I’m only one man and there’s just so much of it.” We drove in his VW truck across flat countryside under a quivering winter sun. He was dressed in a fleece and hiking boots, a fine bushy head of hair streaming from beneath a flat cap, and had a shy, handsome face. Wheatcroft spoke to me in a rolling Midlands accent interrupted every so often by a yawn. He was knackered, he said. He had been trying to set his collection in order, cataloguing late into the night, and making frequent trips to Cornwall, where, at huge expense, he was restoring the only remaining <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-boat\">Kriegsmarine S-Boat</a> in existence. He felt he was being pulled in too many directions – there were the demands of his restoration projects, the racetrack at Donington Park, his property portfolio, and always, for the collector, a lead to be followed up, another gem to be uncovered.</p> \n<p>Wheatcroft had recently purchased two more barns and a dozen shipping containers to house his collection. The complex of industrial buildings, stretching across several flat Leicestershire acres, seemed like a manifestation of his obsession – just as haphazard, as cluttered and as dark. As we made our way into the first of his warehouses, Wheatcroft stood back for a moment, as if shocked by the scale of what he had accumulated. Many of the tanks before us were little more than rusting husks, ravaged by the years they had spent abandoned in the deserts of North Africa or on the Russian steppes. They jostled each other in the warehouses, spewing out to sit in glum convoys around the complex’s courtyard. “Every object in the collection has a story,” Wheatcroft told me as we made our way under the turrets of tanks, stepping over V2 rockets and U-boat torpedoes. “The story of the war, then subsequent wars, and finally the story of the recovery and restoration. All that history is there in the machine today.”</p> \n<p>We stood beside the muscular bulk of a Panzer IV tank, patched with rust and freckled with bullet holes, its tracks trailing barbed wire. Wheatcroft scratched at the palimpsest of paintwork to reveal layers of colour beneath: its current livery, the duck-egg blue of the Christian Phalangists from the Lebanese civil war, flaking away to the green of the Czech army who used the vehicles in the 1960s and 70s, and finally the original German taupe. The tank was abandoned in the Sinai desert until Wheatcroft arrived on one of his regular shopping trips to the region and shipped it home to Leicestershire.</p> \n<p>Wheatcroft owns a fleet of 88 tanks – more than the Danish and Belgian armies combined. The majority of the tanks are German, and Wheatcroft recently acted as an adviser to David Ayer, the director of Fury (in which Brad Pitt played the commander of a German-based US Sherman tank in the final days of the war).“They still got a lot of things wrong,” he told me. “I was sitting in the cinema with my daughter saying, ‘That wouldn’t have happened’ and ‘That isn’t right.’ Good film, though.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"296ed21acdfae55bc79bef780bd995b5d424d984\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435066472604/4fd00d94-5afe-483a-b273-92f01d310d11-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kevin Wheatcroft with one of his tanks\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kevin Wheatcroft with one of his tanks. He owns 88 – more than the Belgian and Danish armies combined.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Around the tanks sat a number of strange hybrid vehicles with caterpillar tracks at the back, lorry wheels at the front. Wheatcroft explained to me that these were half-tracks, deliberately designed by the Nazis so as not to flout the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, which stipulated that the Germans could not build tanks. Wheatcroft owns more of these than anyone else in the world, as well as having the largest collection of Kettenkrads, which are half-motorbike, half-tank, and were built to be dropped out of gliders. “They just look very cool,” he said with a grin.</p> \n<p>Alongside the machines’ stories of wartime escapades and the sometimes dangerous lengths that Wheatcroft had gone to in order to secure them were the dazzling facts of their value. “The Panzer IV cost me $25,000. I’ve been offered two and a half million for it now. It’s the same with the half-tracks. They regularly go for over a million each. Even the Kettenkrads, which I’ve picked up for as little as &pound;1,000, go for &pound;150,000.” I tried to work out the total value of the machines around me, and gave up somewhere north of &pound;50m. Wheatcroft had made himself a fortune, almost without realising it. “Everyone just assumes that I’ve inherited a race track and I’m a spoilt rich kid who wants to indulge in these toys,” he told me, a defensive edge to his voice. “It’s not like that at all. My dad supported me, but only when I could prove that the collection would work financially. And as a collector, you never have any spare money lying around. Everything is tied up in the collection.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Everyone just assumes that I’ve inherited a race track and I’m a spoilt rich kid who wants to indulge in these toys</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Kevin Wheatcroft</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Leaning against the wall of one of the warehouses, I spotted a dark wooden door, heavy iron bolts on one side and a Judas window in the centre. Wheatcroft saw me looking at it. “That’s the door to Hitler’s cell in Landsberg. Where he wrote Mein Kampf. I was in the area.” A lot of Wheatcroft’s stories start like this – he seems to have a genius for proximity. “I found out that the prison was being pulled down. I drove there, parked up and watched the demolition. At lunch I followed the builders to the pub and bought them a round. I did it three days in a row and by the end of it, I drove off with the door, some bricks and the iron bars from his cell.” It was the first time he had mentioned Hitler by name. We paused for a moment by the dark door with its black bars, then moved on.</p> \n<p>Sometimes the stories of search and recovery were far more interesting than the objects themselves. Near the door sat a trio of rusty wine racks. “They were Hitler’s,” he said, laying a proprietary hand upon the nearest one. “We pulled them out of the ruins of the Berghof [Hitler’s home in Berchtesgaden] in May 1989. The whole place was dynamited in ’52, but my friend Adrian and I climbed through the ruins of the garage and down through air vents to get in. You can still walk through all of the underground levels. We made our way by torchlight through laundry rooms, central heating service areas. Then a bowling alley with big signs for Coke all over it. Hitler loved to drink Coke. We brought back these wine racks.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d42ca1114df94f6759523418d9ddf7e9905052f6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435065470840/89b63898-2171-47b7-9bdc-eb8b6bdd73b5-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A silver-bound edition of Mein Kampf.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A silver-bound edition of Mein Kampf.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Later, among engine parts and ironwork, I came across a massive bust of Hitler, sitting on the floor next to a condom vending machine (“I collect pub memorabilia, too,” Wheatcroft explained). “I have the largest collection of Hitler heads in the world,” he said, a refrain that returned again and again. “This one came from a ruined castle in Austria. I bought it from the town council.”</p> \n<p>“Things have the longest memories of all,” says the introduction to a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/object-lesson.html?rref=collection%2Fcolumn%2Fon-photography\">recent essay by Teju Cole</a>, “beneath their stillness, they are alive with the terrors they have witnessed.” This is what you feel in the presence of the Wheatcroft Collection – a sense of great proximity to history, to horror, an uncanny feeling that the objects know more than they are letting on.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>Wheatcroft’s home sits behind high walls </strong>and heavy gates. There is a pond, its surface stirred by the fingers of a willow tree. A spiky black mine bobs along one edge. The house is huge and modern and somehow without logic, as if wings and extensions have been appended to the main structure willy-nilly. When I visited, it was late afternoon, a winter moon climbing the sky. Behind the house, apple trees hung heavy with fruit. A Krupp submarine cannon stood sentry outside the back door. One of the outer walls was set with wide maroon half-moons of iron work, inlaid with obscure runic symbols. “They were from the top of the officers’ gates to Buchenwald,” Wheatcroft told me in an offhand manner. “I’ve got replica gates to Auschwitz – <em>Arbeit Macht Frei</em> – over there.” He gestured into the gloaming.</p> \n<p>I had first heard about Wheatcroft from my aunt Gay, who, as a rather half-hearted expat estate agent, sold him a rambling chateau near Limoges. They subsequently enjoyed (or endured) a brief, doomed love affair. Despite the inevitable break-up, my father kept in touch with Wheatcroft and, several years ago, was invited to his home. After a drink in the pub-cum-officers’ mess that Wheatcroft has built adjacent to his dining room, my dad was shown to the guest apartment. It was remarkable, he said, mostly for the furniture. That night, my dad slept in Hermann G&ouml;ring’s favourite bed, from Carinhall hunting lodge, made of walnut wood and carved with a constellation of swastikas. There were glassy eyed deer heads and tusky boars on the walls, wolf-skin rugs on the floor. My father was a little spooked, but mostly intrigued. In an email soon after, he described Wheatcroft to me as “absurdly decent, almost unnaturally friendly”.</p> \n<p>Darkness had fallen as we stepped into the immense, two-storey barn conversion behind his home. It was the largest of the network of buildings surrounding the house, and wore a fresh coat of paint and shiny new locks on the doors. As we walked inside, Wheatcroft turned to me with a thin smile, and I could tell that he was excited. “I have to have strict rules in my life,” he said, “I don’t show many people the collection, because not many people can understand the motives behind it, people don’t understand my values.” He kept making these tentative passes at the stigma attached to his obsession, as if at once baffled by those who might find his collection distasteful, and desperately keen to defend himself, and it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I try not to answer when people accuse me of being a Nazi. I tend to turn my back and leave them looking silly</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Kevin Wheatcroft</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The lower level of the building contained a now-familiar range of tanks and cars, including the Mercedes G4 Wheatcroft saw as a child in Monaco. “I cried and cried because my dad wouldn’t buy me this car. Now, almost 50 years later, I’ve finally got it.” On the walls huge iron swastikas hung, street-signs for Adolf Hitler Strasse and Adolf Hitler Platz, posters of Hitler with “<em>Ein Volk, Ein Reich, Ein F&uuml;hrer</em>” written beneath. “That’s from Wagner’s family home,” he told me, pointing to a massive iron eagle spreading its wings over a swastika. It was studded with bullet holes. “I was in a scrap yard in Germany when a feller came in who’d been clearing out the Wagner estate and had come upon this. Bought it straight from him.”</p> \n<p>We climbed a narrow flight of stairs to an airy upper level, and I felt that I had moved deeper into the labyrinth of Wheatcroft’s obsession. In the long, gabled hall were dozens of mannequins, all in Nazi uniform. Some were dressed as Hitler Youth, some as SS officers, others as Wehrmacht soldiers. It was bubble still, the mannequins perched as if frozen in flight, a sleeping Nazi Caerleon. One wall was taken up with machine guns, rifles and rocket launchers in serried rows. The walls were plastered with sketches by Hitler,<strong> </strong>Albert Speer and some rather good nudes by G&ouml;ring’s chauffeur.<strong> </strong>On cluttered display tables sat a scale model of Hitler’s mountain eyrie the Kehlsteinhaus, a twisted machine gun from Hess’s crashed plane, the commandant’s phone from Buchenwald, hundreds of helmets, mortars and shells, wirelesses, Enigma machines, and searchlights, all jostling for attention. Rail after rail of uniforms marched into the distance. “I brought David Ayer in here when he was researching Fury,” Wheatcroft told me. “He offered to buy the whole lot there and then. When I said no he offered me 30 grand for this.” He showed me a fairly ordinary-looking camouflage tunic. “He knows his stuff.” We were standing in front of signed photographs of Hitler and G&ouml;ring. “I think I could give up everything else,” he said, “the cars, the tanks, the guns, as long as I could still have Adolf and Hermann. They’re my real love.”</p> \n<p>I asked Wheatcroft whether he was worried about what people might read into his fascination with Nazism. Other notable collectors, I pointed out, were the bankrupt and discredited David Irving and Lemmy from Mot&ouml;rhead. “I try not to answer when people accuse me of being a Nazi,” he said. “I tend to turn my back and leave them looking silly. I think Hitler and G&ouml;ring were such fascinating characters in so many ways. Hitler’s eye for quality was just extraordinary.” He swept his arm across the army of motionless Nazis surrounding us, taking in the uniforms and the bayonets, the dimly glimmering guns and medals. “More than that, though,” he continued, “I want to preserve things. I want to show the next generation how it actually was. And this collection is a memento for those who didn’t come back. It’s the sense of history you get from these objects, the conversations that went on around them, the way they give you a link to the past. It’s a very special feeling.”</p> \n<p>We walked around the rest of the exhibition, stopping for a moment by a nondescript green backpack. “There’s a story behind this,” he said. “I found a roll of undeveloped film in it. I’d only bought the backpack to hang on a mannequin, but inside was this film. I had it developed and there were five unpublished pictures of Bergen-Belsen on it. It must have been very soon after the liberation, because there were bulldozers moving piles of bodies.”</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f071c8fe13856176640f53bb47878a907a2bce23\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435068764390/d62df28b-dc4b-4b92-82bb-32b8b3a4b5c8-345x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Josef Mengele's grandfather clock.\" width=\"345\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Josef Mengele’s grandfather clock.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>The most treasured pieces of Wheatcroft’s collection</strong> are kept in his house, a maze-like place, low-ceilinged and full of staircases, corridors that turn back on themselves, hidden doorways and secret rooms. As soon as we entered through the back door, he began to apologise for the state of the place. “I’ve been trying to get it all in order, but there just aren’t the hours in the day.” In the drawing room there was a handsome walnut case in which sat Eva Braun’s gramophone and record collection. We walked through to the snooker room, which housed a selection of Hitler’s furniture, as well as two motorbikes. The room was so cluttered that we could not move further than the doorway.</p> \n<p>“I picked up all of Hitler’s furniture at a guesthouse in Linz,” Wheatcroft told me. “The owner’s father’s dying wish had been that a certain room should be kept locked. I knew Hitler had lived there and so finally persuaded him to open it and it was exactly as it had been when Hitler slept in the room. On the desk there was a blotter covered in Hitler’s signatures in reverse, the drawers were full of signed copies of Mein Kampf. I bought it all. I sleep in the bed, although I’ve changed the mattress.” A shy, conspiratorial smile.</p> \n<p>We made our way through to the galleried dining room, where a wax figure of Hitler stood on the balcony, surveying us coldly. There was a rustic, beer-hall feel to the place. On the table sat flugelhorns and euphoniums, trumpets and drums. “I’ve got the largest collection of Third Reich military instruments in the world,” Wheatcroft told me. Of course he did. There was Mengele’s grandfather clock, topped with a depressed-looking bear. “I had trouble getting that out of Argentina. I finally had it smuggled out as tractor parts to the Massey-Ferguson factory in Coventry.” Wheatcroft briefly opened a door to show the pub he had built for himself. Even here there was a Third Reich theme – the cellar door was originally from the Berghof.</p> \n<p>The electricity was off in one wing of the house, and we made our way in dim light through a conservatory where rows of Hitler heads stared blindly across at each other. Every wall bore a portrait of the F&uuml;hrer, or of G&ouml;ring, until the two men felt so present and ubiquitous that they were almost alive. In a well at the bottom of a spiral staircase, Wheatcroft paused beneath a full-length portrait of Hitler. “This was his favourite painting of himself, the one used for stamps and official reproductions.” The F&uuml;hrer looked peacockish and preening, a snooty tilt to his head. We climbed the stairs to find more pictures of Hitler on the walls, swastikas and iron crosses, a faintly Egyptian statuette given by Hitler to Peron, an oil portrait of Eva Braun signed by Hitler. Paintings were stacked against walls, bubble wrap was everywhere. We picked our way between the artefacts, stepping over statuary and half-unpacked boxes. I found myself imagining the house in a decade’s time, when no doors would open, no light come in through the windows, when the collection would have swallowed every last corner, and I could picture Wheatcroft, quite happy, living in a caravan in the garden.</p> \n<p>We passed along more shadowy corridors, through a door hidden in a bookshelf and up another winding staircase, until we found ourselves in an unexceptional bedroom, a single unshaded light in the ceiling illuminating piles of uniforms. On the walls of the room were a host of gaudy naif paintings and objects in display cases. “They all belonged to the Krays,” Wheatcroft said. “That’s my other great love, the Kray twins.” There was a chill in the air in this room, under the swinging white light of the lamp.<strong> </strong>Somehow this collection of gangland trinkets and their casual brutality seemed to undermine the lofty aspirations of the rest of the collection. There was Ronnie’s death certificate on the wall, his framed false teeth, the gun he used for one of his first murders. On the mantelpiece in the corner of the room there was a small library of books about the twins. Further inspection of the walls revealed the Krays’ cufflinks and rings, spoons from Broadmoor, some early mugshots. Wheatcroft reached into a cupboard and pulled out Hitler’s white dress suit with careful, supplicatory hands.</p> \n<p>“I was in Munich with a dealer,” he said, showing me the tailor’s label, which read Reichsf&uuml;hrer Adolf Hitler in looping cursive. “We had a call to go and visit a lawyer, who had some connection to Eva Braun. In 1944, Eva Braun had deposited a suitcase in a fireproof safe. He quoted me a price, contents unseen. The case was locked with no key. We drove to Hamburg and had a locksmith open it. Inside were two full sets of Hitler’s suits, including this one, two Sam Browne belts, two pairs of his shoes, two bundles of love letters written by Hitler to Eva, two sketches of Eva naked, sunbathing, two self-propelling pencils. A pair of AH-monogrammed eyeglasses. A pair of monogrammed champagne flutes. A painting of a Vienna cityscape by Hitler that he must have given to Eva. I was in a dream world. The greatest find of my collecting career.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd627fb1f269809639472cc9041a8baa480eae53\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435067480900/f3806673-f379-4abb-ba85-a4335a297c52-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Hitler mannequin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A wax figure of Hitler surveys the dining room in Kevin Wheatcroft’s house.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wheatcroft drove me to the station under a wide, star-filled night. “When David Ayer offered to buy the collection, I almost said yes,” he told me, his eyes on the road. “Just so it wouldn’t be my problem any more. I tried to buy the house in which Hitler was born in Braunau, I thought I could move the collection there, turn it into a museum of the Third Reich. The Austrian government must have Googled my name. They said no immediately. They didn’t want it to become a shrine. It’s so hard to know what to do with all the stuff. I really do feel like I’m just a caretaker until the next person comes along, but I must display it, I must get it out into the public – I understand that.” We pulled into the station car park and, with a wave, he drove off into the night.</p> \n<h2>* * *</h2> \n<p><strong>On the way home I read</strong> Wheatcroft’s father’s autobiography and then stared out of the train window, feeling the events of the day working themselves upon me. The strange thing was not the weirdness of it all, but the normality. I really don’t believe that Wheatcroft is anything other than what he seems – a fanatical collector. I had expected a closet Nazi, a wild-eyed goosestepper, and instead I had met a man wrestling with a hobby that had become an obsession and was now a millstone. Collecting was like a disease for him, the prospect of completion tantalisingly near but always just out of reach. If he was mad, it wasn’t the madness of the fulminating antisemite, rather the mania of the collector.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"de5e5764d330517efd050c1ebcbc4c56c7b0ee5b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435064709485/abe83430-6c4f-4bcb-b99a-23db6f190863-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A pair of Ronnie Kray's shoes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pair of Ronnie Kray’s shoes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many would question whether artefacts such as those in the Wheatcroft Collection ought to be preserved at all, let alone exhibited in public. Should we really be queueing up to marvel at these emblems of what Primo Levi called the Nazis’ “histrionic arts”? It is, perhaps, the very darkness of these objects, their proximity to real evil, that attracts collectors (and that keeps novelists and filmmakers returning to the years 1939-45 for material). In the conflicting narratives and counter-narratives of history, there is something satisfyingly simple about the evil of the Nazis, the schoolboy Manichaeism of the second world war. Later, Wheatcroft would tell me that his earliest memory was of lining up Tonka tanks on his bedroom floor, watching the ranks of Shermans and Panzers and Crusaders facing off against each other, a childish battle of good and evil.</p> \n<p>After I sent him a copy of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2012/may/16/hhhh-laurent-binet-review\">Laurent Binet’s 2010 novel HHhH</a>, a brilliant retelling of the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich, one of the principal architects of the Holocaust, Wheatcroft emailed me with news of an astonishing new find in the house of a retired diplomat. “I’d fully intended to ease up on the collecting,” he told me, “to concentrate on cataloguing, on getting the collection out there, but actually some of the things I’ve discovered since I saw you last, I’ve just had to buy. Big-value items, but you just have to forget about that because of the sheer rarity value. It’s compounded the problem really, because they were all massive things.”</p> \n<p>His latest find, he said, was a collection of Nazi artefacts brought to his attention by someone he had met at an auction a few years back. The story is classic Wheatcroft – a mixture of luck and happenstance and chutzpah that appears to have turned up objects of genuine historical interest. “This chap told me that his best friend was a plumber and was working on a big house in Cornwall. The widow was trying to sort things out. The plumber had seen that in the garden there were all sorts of Nazi statues. He sent me a picture of one of the statues, which was a massive 5 &frac12; foot stone eagle that came from Berchtesgaden. I did a deal and bought it, and after that sale my contact was shown a whole range of other objects by the widow. It turned out that this house was a treasure trove. There’s an enormous amount I’m trying to get hold of now. I can’t say an awful lot, but it’s one of the most important finds of recent times.”</p> \n<p>The owner of the house had just passed away; he was apparently a senior British diplomat who, in his regular trips to Germany in the lead-up to the war, amassed a sizable collection of Nazi memorabilia. He continued to collect after the war had finished, the most interesting items hidden in a safe room behind a secret panel. “It’s stunning,” Wheatcroft told me, by telephone, his voice fizzing with excitement.<strong> </strong>“There’s a series of handwritten letters between Hitler and Churchill. They were writing to each other about the route the war was taking. Discussions of a non-aggression pact. This man had copied things and removed them on a day-to-day basis over the course of the war. A complete breach of the Official Secrets Act, but mindblowing.” The authenticity of the papers, of course, has not yet been confirmed – but if they are real, they could secure Wheatcroft a place in the history books. “Although it’s never been about me,” he insisted.</p> \n<p>It seems our meeting in the winter stirred something in Wheatcroft, a realisation that there were duties that came with owning the objects in his collection, obligations to the past and present that had become burdensome to him. “It’s the objects,” he told me repeatedly, “the history.” It also seemed as if Wheatcroft’s halfhearted attempts to bring his collection to a wider public had been given a much-needed fillip. “An awful lot has changed since I saw you,” he told me when we spoke in late spring. “It refocused me, talking to you about it. It made me think about how much time has gone by. I’ve spent, I suppose, 50 years as a collector just plodding along, and I’ve suddenly realised that there’s more time behind than ahead, and I need to do something about it. I’ve pressed several expensive buttons in order to get some of my more valuable pieces restored. Because you did just make me think what’s the point of owning these things if no one’s ever going to see them?” <span class=\"bullet\">•</span></p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Follow the Long Read on Twitter:<a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnlongread\"> @gdnlongread.</a></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435060129598/1897e46f-1537-4263-8a55-5d0e009f0755-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Sillitoe for the Guardian","altText":"Kevin Wheatcroft at home in Leicestershire, where he keeps one of the largest collections of German military vehicles and Nazi memorabilia.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063008843/e2401ae0-497c-4174-982d-f40e374fc147-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kevin Wheatcroft at home in Leicestershire, where he keeps one of the largest collections of German military vehicles and Nazi memorabilia.

The weather is only one factor, because much depends on where exactly you will be hanging out. You wouldn’t pack the same holiday wardrobe for a cultured city break in Madrid as you would for a party weekend in Mykonos, would you?</p> \n<h2>The Pyramid stage</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"50d12cfac58fd50b18940a0968964a26f3442f63\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435072397074/2795d687-ece8-4b86-bbab-0362033fc49a-236x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A festivalgoer in printed bodysuit at Glastonbury in 2014\" width=\"236\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A festivalgoer in printed bodysuit at Glastonbury in 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Hordle/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"286885cc2201643d236d504c97e5e5c163d14746\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435072042964/06f44541-99b4-4aad-b9e5-e665502b2add-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Katherine Jenkins at Glastonbury in 2013\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katherine Jenkins at Glastonbury in 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The festivalgoers who camp out right in front of the Pyramid stage are, for obvious reasons, the ones you will see on the telly. So you know this look already: cut-off denim shorts, wellies, bikini top under a brightly coloured anorak, flower garland worn as headband. Two years after Katherine Jenkins wore a flower garland, denim cut offs and box-fresh Hunters to Glastonbury 2013, the look refuses to die. This is as mainstream as Glastonbury gets, the festival equivalent of a tailored day dress and shoulder bag from House of Fraser on the 8.09 from suburbia. Which makes sense, since this is the crowd who have travelled to Glastonbury in order to hear songs they know all the words to from Cardio Workout Hits Volume 3. </p> \n<p>Katherine Ormerod, founder of the Fashion Content Agency, predicts that this year’s on-your-boyfriend’s-shoulders-for-the-headliners style updates will include Hunter’s short Chelsea boot-style wellies, printed bodysuits and gold and silver temporary tattoos. Around the age of 24, this crowd graduates from neon to boho tops, while cut-offs remain in play into the early 30s. But before you roll your eyes at the cut-off denim short, bear in mind that, as Emily Eavis points out, “my dad [festival founder Michael] has always worn them. They are easy to navigate in a portaloo, they don’t drag in the mud, they’ve got lots of useful pockets. They’re perfect.”</p> \n<h2><br /></h2> \n<h2>West Holts stage</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bdc766cf0d0adaa168bf5865a0af3f0e2cb1fae\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435072113918/22816d95-3bc7-45c6-8cd7-8ab56c57439c-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Kate Moss at Glastonbury in 2013\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kate Moss at Glastonbury in 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Boland/FilmMagic</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The cool kids booked the Braid Bar at Selfridges well in advance to ensure the perfect Bey/Cara-style cornrow plaits (they last for days). Then they decanted day-to-day essentials into a Mansur Gavriel bucket bag and curated a faux-casual model-off-duty look of faded black jeans, T by Wang hoodies and McQ cotton scarves. Sunglasses are a rounded cats’ eye shape (Miu Miu are the best, but Zara’s are pretty good). Their style flourish for the new festival season is a bandana tied around one wrist. The in-crowd slogan T-shirt at the Governors Ball festival in New York last week – “Go Burn Your Flower Crown” – may make an appearance here. </p> \n<p>This tribe mingle with the older generation who still think of this as the Jazz World stage, and whose fashion icons are “Bob Harris and Camilla Batmanghelidjh,” says Sam Wolfson, editor of Noisey. “Up on Pennard Hill, where teenagers and students tend to camp, you see a lot more of the 2008 Kate Moss festival look, with the shorts and oversized jackets, as well as bindis and Native American headdresses, rightly considered problematic by readers of Comment is Free,” he says. “But Glastonbury is also a place where forgotten subcultures congregate in weird areas, so head down to Silver Hayes [the old Dance Village] at 3pm on Friday and you’ll see former rave kids, now in their 40s, doused in glitter, feathers and smiley faces.” Silver Hayes is also the place for “ironic sunglasses in the shape of pineapples,” advises Laura Weir, fashion features editor of Vogue.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"942ae2edc76b49fc54b62f023fd957165ae4d72e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435072899566/6f0e1338-24e5-4233-9f38-7c3e9b0584d9-460x316.jpeg\" alt=\"A festivalgoer with braided hair at the Governors Ball music festival in New York, 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A festivalgoer with braided hair at the Governors Ball music festival in New York, 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Zuchnik/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Backstage</h2> \n<p>The vast majority of the celebrity photos taken at Glastonbury are taken in the grey area simply marked “No Public Access” on the official sitemaps – the hospitality areas. The crowd are older and wiser, which means “less bum cheek, more vintage references – a bit of a Stevie Nicks, Joni Mitchell vibe”, says Ormerod. And there are fewer headdresses, because, as Weir points out, “the look here is very much, ‘I do this all the time’. A kind of casual, I’m-with-the-band swish.” Expect a few dungarees (subtext: I wee in a Winnebago). The bar is propped up by industry execs “in rancid Britpop camo jackets,” says Wolfson. “And Florence, who always dresses like Margot from the Good Life, Lily, who seems to have a rave wardrobe bought entirely from late 90s Gatecrasher kids, and Alexa, who wears the same look David Cameron would on a weekend in the Cotswolds.”<br /></p> \n<h2>Side of stage</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3213ad4f19a78982d2a4a3e22e4eb9b850bb36c1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435079250282/8cdd098e-4a3c-47da-ad9a-2e9b93425fe3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Gwyneth Paltrow and Apple at Live 8 London in 2005\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gwyneth Paltrow and Apple at Live 8 London in 2005.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Tregidgo/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In fashion terms, Kim Kardashian is headlining Glastonbury this year. Her side-of-stage look on Saturday night is much anticipated: will she eschew wellies for Louboutins, as Bey did when she watched Jay Z six years ago? Will she do a Gwyneth in her Coldplay-wife days, and bring the baby in ear defenders? “Side of stage, you get your record label execs – who are staying off-site in a hotel, and so have a completely different level of cleanliness. Their ironed shirts look so incongruous next to backing dancers in feathers,” says Anna Russell of AR Artist Management. This is also the spot to see the festival hardcore, whose epic mountains of wristbands in every possible shade rival the brass coils stacked around the necks of the Kayan people of Burma.</p> \n<h2>Shangri-La And Block9</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"766438a60638cf344d890de76b50d567508e3d51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435073113852/6dd758c5-307b-4873-a84a-9eff40109ebd-267x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Glam rocks … a model wearing a Rosa Bloom leotard with outsize, round sequins and feather headdress\" width=\"267\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Glam rocks … a model wearing a Rosa Bloom leotard with outsize, round sequins and feather headdress.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Studio 54 meets dystopia” is how Anna Russell describes the Glastonbury neighbourhoods that come to life after dark. This is where the edgiest fashion happens (and where the major brands send their researchers and cool-hunters to sniff out the coming looks). Jonny Woo, comedian and drag artist, presides over Block9, which has “a queer, underground, urban vibe,” he says. “This is where you’ll see a couture Dior look, or 70s Halston at the Downlow. Or a Mad Max Cyber look at Arcardia. No one looks down on anyone at Glastonbury – it’s all about the love across the whole festival. But if you come to Block9, don’t be surprised if you are stripped down and re-styled by any one of the drag queens hanging off the scaffold. You’ll definitley leave rocking a cooler look than when you arrived.” </p> \n<p>Woo’s tip for 2015: “Beg, borrow or steal a wristband for Maceo’s, which is where the cool kids – and the crew, who really go for it – head for serious partying.” Didn’t pack anything glam enough to get in? Head for Rosa Bloom’s stall and pick up a leotard covered in outsize, round sequins. “Festivalgoers love sequins,” says the label’s designer Rosa Hirsch-Holland. “When I first made them, I thought they would be a niche item, but the range of people who buy them is amazing. They seem to make women feel good.”<br /></p> \n<h2>The Green Fields</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8c8481f2c9897e804ad4bb609be34421e73b3855\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435072538804/ff50d2b6-a035-432f-87c5-741793583403-252x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Florence Welch at Glastonbury in 2010\" width=\"252\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Florence Welch at Glastonbury in 2010.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David McHugh / Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>OK, so the fashion here would make Diana Vreeland turn in her grave – harem pants, those big cross-body tie-dye bags, really terrible sandals – but who cares? The commitment to recycling and sustainability here is way ahead of the pack. And now that Bey’s a (sort of) vegan, breakfast at Manic Organic in the Green Fields is set to be a one-weekend-only substitute for people-watching at the Wolseley. And, as Ormerod says, “the only real Glastonbury snobbery is about community spirit. You look down on people who don’t get into the peace-and-love spirit – people who steal from tents, people who drag you into the mud (especially if you’re wearing Saint Laurent), litterbugs, queue jumpers etc. It’s very British in that respect.”</p> \n<p>The hippie outposts are also the place to expect the unexpected. The scale of the festival, with epic walks from one stage to another on which even veterans get totally lost, means that tribes mingle. As Emily Eavis says, “You might see a bloke in a Chelsea shirt in the Stone Circle, and that’s one of the things that makes Glastonbury special. There is a mainstream festival look that gets photographed a lot and has become commodified, but that’s not representative of what you see here. It’s so much more imaginative, a brilliant mix of practicality and fancy dress. There are incredibly dressed people, and you wouldn’t necessarily expect that on a camping trip.”</p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435071896842/Festivalgoers-at-the-Sout-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Festival style at the South West Four Music Festival in 2013.

No children play cricket, wrestle or run. Even when evening comes and the searing Indian summer temperatures subside, they will remain with their marbles or toys indoors in this poor Delhi neighbourhood.<br /></p> \n<p>Basona Bhadra, 26, watches her eight-year-old son, Varu, pour water from one cup to another on her kitchen floor. “He gets breathless and ill,” she says. “He doesn’t like going out any more. He is happier at home.”</p> \n<p>Bhadra and her family moved from the city of Meerut, 50 miles away, to Anand Vihar, in the east of the Indian capital, four months ago. She blames the heat for the hacking cough that made her child abandon the energetic games he used to enjoy.</p> \n<p>Local doctors disagree. Abhinav Agarwal, a paediatrician in nearby Vaishali, says around a third of his patients suffer chronic respiratory ailments – a consequence, he says, of Delhi’s appalling pollution.</p> \n<p>Agarwal’s conclusions are backed by data. A survey released last year by the World Health Organisation found that Delhi was the most polluted city in the world, with an annual average of 153 micrograms of the most dangerous small particulates, known as PM2.5s, per cubic metre.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2014/nov/03/india-air-pollution-cutting-crop-yields-by-almost-half\">India air pollution 'cutting crop yields by almost half'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2014/nov/27/india-court-delhis-worsening-air-pollution\">India court slams Delhi's worsening air pollution</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/india-untamed/2015/jun/05/why-an-opinion-article-on-delhis-air-pollution-upset-many-indians\">Why an opinion article on Delhi's air pollution upset many Indians | Janaki Lenin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The level was six times the WHO’s recommended maximum, 12 times US standards and more than twice the level considered safe even by Indian authorities. During winter, when lower temperatures and fires intensify the pollution, concentrations of PM2.5s routinely spike much higher, regularly reaching levels described by experts as hazardous for humans.</p> \n<p>The worst hit among Agarwal’s patients are children, particularly those aged between two and seven. “They are the most vulnerable. It’s been bad for years now. I don’t know if it’s getting worse, or not. It’s definitely not getting better,” he says.</p> \n<p>There are now fears that millions of children in India will suffer serious health problems later in life.</p> \n<p>“If you look at lung function in children [here], there is significant decline with constant exposure. This will probably be irreversible. For adults, there is also a more rapid decline than usual with age. Some suggest it is the equivalent of smoking around 10 cigarettes per day. There is also a higher chance of developing coronary and arterial disease,” says Dr Guleria, a lung specialist at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.</p> \n<p>The WHO found that India has the world’s highest rate of death from respiratory disease, with 159 per 100,000 in 2012, about 10 times that of Italy, five times that of the UK and twice that of China. One <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/landmark-study-lies-buried-how-delhis-poisonous-air-is-damaging-its-children-for-life/\">study</a> found that half of Delhi’s 4.4 million schoolchildren would never recover full lung capacity.</p> \n<p>Much depends on levels of exposure, which means that children, who in India often cycle or walk to school along busy roads, receive extremely high doses of toxic chemicals and damaging particulates. <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Press/-Delhi-children-breath-toxic-air-reveals-Greenpeace-air-monitoring-survey-in-schools/\">Daily levels in schools</a> are four times worse than those that are supposed to trigger alerts in London.</p> \n<p>In Anand Vihar, the factors that cause pollution across Delhi are particularly severe. There is heavy traffic, swollen by often badly maintained and old trucks and buses; huge landfill rubbish dumps which are sometimes set on fire; filthy industries just a few miles from the city; two coal-fired power stations; nearby intensive construction which generates choking clouds of dust; and, seasonally, smoke from crop burning in fields from farmland in neighbouring states.</p> \n<p>Another blackspot in Delhi is Munirka, in the south of the city and close to two heavily congested ring roads.<br /></p> \n<p>Meenu Singh, a Munirka resident whose eight-year-old son has severe asthma which doctors blame on pollution, says she would leave the city if she could.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4561540828a61f9427793fa4b194c9f5caf64a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434454114521/e760fcf8-6da1-4572-b590-cf514236ac8b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Smog envelops buildings on the outskirts of Delhi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smog envelops buildings on the outskirts o Delhi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I’m really worried about my child’s health. I don’t want him to be in Delhi, but we have no choice at the moment. He is missing exams and school so his education is suffering. We would hope to one day send him to boarding school and even abroad so that he can live an healthy life,” she says.</p> \n<p>Many expatriate workers have already <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/newdelhi/capital-punishment-delhi-s-poisonous-air-prompts-nyt-correspondent-to-leave-india/article1-1353527.aspx\">left the city,</a> with some major international companies now preferring to base executives in Dubai or Bangkok. Classes at international schools in the city have been cut as numbers dwindle.</p> \n<p>Delhi saw significant improvement in its air quality a decade ago following a slew of measures including converting buses and autorickshaws to run on gas, moving small industries to zones on the outskirts of the city and raising emission standards. But benefits were swiftly lost.</p> \n<p>“We could not keep the momentum. Now there is a new challenge, and it is much more complicated,” says Anumita Choudhury of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi thinktank.</p> \n<p>Choudhury says the problem is a “mobility crisis” in Delhi as use of private vehicles has soared while public transport has suffered chronic under-investment. Between 1991 and 2011, the population of Delhi and its adjoining cities more than doubled to 22 million while the number of registered cars and motorbikes increased fivefold to around 8m.</p> \n<p>“We love our cars these days and middle class families have two, three, four of them,” says Surender Sharma, a retired senior air force officer in Delhi who moved to the top floor of a high rise block on the city’s outskirts three years ago to escape air pollution.</p> \n<p>Environmentalists<a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/pollution/Act-on-Delhis-foul-air-now/articleshow/47561541.cms\"> say</a> between 40% and 50% of the dangerous PM2.5 particulates in Delhi are caused by vehicles. The figures have been challenged by the car industry. One major problem, all admit, is the 70,000 trucks which drive through the city every night on long-distance journeys. A plan to build a bypass has been repeatedly delayed.</p> \n<p>A new metro has barely made an impact, experts say, as almost all those who use it were previously using buses or bicycles, not cars.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce77ccafa31c8c2ed14a67e948035b4496100f64\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434453325103/93eb9aa8-c674-41d0-98a0-b3ccc5b85d2f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Police officers wear masks as they control traffic in Delhi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers wear masks as they control traffic in Delhi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After being ignored by the media and politicians for many years, the problem of toxic air is now becoming a significant domestic issue with newspapers highlighting the problem.</p> \n<p>“Clean air is a human right,” Prakash Javadekar, the environment minister, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/05/indian-minister-promises-acute-air-pollution-world-health-organisation\">said earlier this year</a>.</p> \n<p>The Bharatiya Janata party government won a landslide victory at an election last year. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, campaigned on a promise of boosting India’s flagging growth. It has been unclear how he intends to reconcile economic development with protection of India’s forests and rivers and an improvement in air quality.</p> \n<p>Conflicts between local and national governments, and between agencies, have also hampered efforts.</p> \n<p>The result is that no significant policies beyond a national air monitoring index have yet been announced, while many measures introduced elsewhere, such as<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/sorry-children-school-wont-shut-on-bad-air-days/\"> closing schools</a> during spikes of pollution or forcing old vehicles off the road, have been rejected.</p> \n<p>“Only 14% of individual journeys in Delhi are made in private vehicles. It is a small minority who are determining policy in this city so the majority voice has to come out louder to determine travel and investment choices,” says Choudhury, of the CSE.</p> \n<p>The problem is not restricted to the capital. According to the WHO, 13 of the dirtiest 20 cities in the world are in India.</p> \n<p>Medical experts fear a failure to act rapidly could be costly in the long run. “We have a very young population currently being exposed [to severe pollution] and they will have very significant health problems in 15 to 20 years’ time. We are just looking at this in terms of short-term economic growth. The health cost has been forgotten,” says Guleria, the lung specialist.</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434728512023/2eb20871-6bd1-42c6-a52e-e1c880efd0f1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Hindustan Times/Getty Images","altText":"Children cover their faces to try to protect themselves from air pollution in the Indian capital.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434454116187/e760fcf8-6da1-4572-b590-cf514236ac8b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Smog envelops buildings on the outskirts o Delhi.

These legacies are crucial to London’s character, but the image has a negative: neighbourhoods lost in the shadows, once taken for granted, now forgotten. </p> \n<p>This process of vanishing continues all around us. To understand the change that is happening in London right now, it helps to place it in the context of the past. Many vanished neighbourhoods were destined to disappear, superseded by changing economies, technologies, populations and fashions. Others were deliberately demolished to improve the city. Are we sure that our estate redevelopment plans are so different to those of the Victorians, who cleared poorer areas with what seems to us now like reckless abandon?</p> \n<p>By taking a closer look at vanished London, we can see how we are reshaping the city today – and maybe take a better guess at whether future generations of Londoners will approve.</p> \n<h2><strong>Agar Town</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3917f9488caed3e6030404a37a56f567834b337b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435057323483/93d9be19-cd45-4120-9167-ad73343f4fad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"St Pancras station was opened in 1868, providing a London terminus for the Midland Railway.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St Pancras station was opened in 1868, providing a London terminus for the Midland Railway.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SSPL/Getty/Science &amp; Society Picture Library</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Agar Town, built in the 1840s behind what is now St Pancras Station, sounded like a respectable Victorian suburb – with streets called Canterbury Place, Durham Street, Oxford Crescent – but, in fact, conditions were terrible. The local vestry failed to provide “Ague Town”, as it became known, with street lighting or cleaning, there was no sewerage, and it quickly became synonymous with mud and disease. Agar Town attracted outrage and horror from contemporaries, who claimed it resembled the isolated villages of rural Ireland. Much of the vitriol was directed at the blameless, working-class population who were accused, among other things, of working on the Sabbath to build their own houses. When the Midland Railway company came calling in 1866, Ecclesiastical Commissioners, the landlords of Agar Town, sold the entire place and it was entirely demolished within the space of two months – including its half-finished church – and replaced with railway sidings. Now trains from St Pancras crawl pass the Agar Town site, still in the backlands but now partly occupied by the lower-profile, 1980s houses of the obscure Elm Village.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cripplegate</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3785b7e5e0aff3b9eecd93685d5e8cf0909ebe8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435057230923/04213bcb-945c-432a-99cd-9e4097d20702-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Following the second world war, the Barbican area was almost totally devastated by bombs.

The neighbourhood grew around a gate in the Roman London Wall, and became a place of religious dissent. During the mid-17<sup>th </sup>century it was home to Oliver Cromwell, and fomented the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fifth_Monarchists\">violent Fifth Monarchist uprising in 1661</a>. Later, Cripplegate became inextricably linked, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/jonathanswift\">thanks to Jonathan Swift</a>, with the feuding hack writers of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grub_Street\">Grub Street</a> (now Milton Street) and saw the production of the city’s first daily newspaper. However, by the second world war, Cripplegate had become “Fire Island”, the highest-insurance-risk area in London, occupied by rag trade warehouses packed with tinder-box stock. Two serious fires around the turn of the century were dwarfed on the night of 29 November 1940, when incendiary bombs burned Cripplegate to the ground. When the Barbican sprouted atop much of the ancient quarter, many streets were not rebuilt. Some lost their twins – Golden Lane, Silk Street and Whitecross Street survived, but Silver Street, Paper Street and Redcross Street did not – and a sense of absence still hangs over the area.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a61e0db4f14bd49a4be1554bd1d9f3b8a1676538\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435057120595/acd10d4c-8682-45ed-b7b2-a3fa67fd2461-353x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Dr Johnson’s summer house at Streatham, 1773.

In 1659, thirsty labourers, taking a break from weeding on the steep hill above Streatham Common, tried the water from a spring and, presumably to their surprise, discovered it was a powerful purgative. Reports of its efficacy spread, and Streatham water became a prized commodity. Spa gardens were set up to provide entertainments, and crowds flocked to experience the springs, which were said to be three times as powerful as those at Epsom, and capable of curdling milk. Streatham, a small village beyond the edge of built-up London, became a social centre. A group of intellectuals – the Streatham Worthies, including Samuel Johnson, Edmund Burke, David Garrick and Oliver Goldsmith – gathered at Streatham Park, a mansion owned by Henry and Hester Thrale. The mansion was also the location for negotiations that ended the American War of Independence. Later the Prince Regent was said to stop off regularly on his way to Brighton at the Horse and Groom pub. Fashion moved on, the spa closed, and Streatham became a railway suburb. Streatham water, however, was available until the 1940s, delivered by the local dairy along with the milk.</p> \n<h2><strong>Norton Folgate</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fd045f210d3e9ca48fdf8f50a43f99df3908313\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435058251476/e3ad7731-8210-41ad-9af3-ee98980d053c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Looking North on Norton Folgate towards Shoreditch High Street.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Looking North on Norton Folgate towards Shoreditch High Street.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: C A Mathew/Bishopsgate Library/Jeremy Freedman</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Monasteries\">Dissolution of the Monasteries</a>, Thomas Cromwell gave St Bartholomew’s and St Thomas’s Hospitals to the Mayor of London, but St Mary Spital Priory and Hospital, located between Bishopsgate and Shoreditch, was in bad repair and was demolished. It left behind just a name – Spitalfields – and the Liberty of Norton Folgate, a self-governing area of no more than 10 streets on the lost priory’s lands. By the 19th century, Norton Folgate perched on the edge of the tumultuous East End. Its narrow backstreets filled with Huguenot weavers’ houses, lodgings for market porters and small workshops. The Liberty was administered by its own council of Ten Ancients, chaired by the Headborough, who employed four council officials – two overseers to collect rents, a scavenger who cleaned the streets, and a constable to keep order. Remarkably, this arrangement lasted until 1900, when the Liberty was finally abolished. Now Norton Folgate is a name on a 150-yard stretch of main road, but it is also the front line in the advance of the City of London. Its distinctive 18th- and 19th- century buildings are at the heart of a pitched planning battle, as British Land seek to replace much of the conservation area with the usual glass offices, keeping only the facades.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/mar/29/chinatown-restaurants-london-threat-rent-rises\">Big trouble in little Chinatown as rent rises force restaurant owners out</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Limehouse Chinatown</strong></h2> \n<p>The opium dens of Chinatown, in Victorian Limehouse, remain infamous but their location is little known. Street names are all that remain of a place that gripped the western imagination for decades. Chinese sailors first arrived in Britain with the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/mar/04/east-india-company-original-corporate-raiders\">East India Company</a>, and a small community settled near modern Westferry. They brought with them opium, which was legal until 1914 and cheaper than beer – no surprise as it was produced by the British in India and forcibly sold to China. The myth of a foreign, sinister but impossibly fascinating and exotic East End grew from the 1870s, and held sway until the second world war. Pennyfields and Limehouse Causeway inspired writers from Charles Dickens and Oscar Wilde to Thomas Burke and Sax Rohmer. It also drove anti-Chinese sentiment, which peaked around the first world war, with riots in Limehouse and political campaigns against sailors “taking British jobs”. After the Blitz, many Chinese moved to Soho and the streets were redeveloped. Just a few names on the map – Amoy Place, Ming Street, Pekin Street – hint at the fantasies kindled in this place.</p> \n<h2><strong>White City</strong><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56e29545c4ce7cdb2e6553160d9e153421005b98\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435056818766/1dbb63e3-a2c5-4f2f-9d6f-2abe958042cf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The 'flip-flap' ride at the Franco-British Exhibition held at White City, London, 1908.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ‘flip-flap’ ride at the Franco-British Exhibition held at White City, London, 1908.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/jun/24/which-london-neighbourhoods-will-disappear-next\">Which London neighbourhoods will disappear next?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>White City is known as the home of the BBC and of a large, postwar housing estate, but its name comes from the brilliant white pavilions of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-British_Exhibition_(1908)\">1908 Franco-British Exhibition</a>. The fields of Old Oak Farm, on the edge of London, were the site for London’s first Olympic Park and an exhibition the like of which Britain had never seen. Arranged to mark the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entente_Cordiale\">Entente Cordiale of 1904</a>, the show filled an area eight times the size of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/theguardian/from-the-archive-blog/2011/may/10/newspapers-national-newspapers\">1851 Great Exhibition</a>. Twenty “palaces” and 120 pavilions cheerfully combined Arabian, rococo and Tudor styles to unique effect. The “White City” looked like a mirage of a city, beamed on to the Shepherd’s Bush scrubland. It was incredibly popular, with 100,000 visitors a day enjoying a strange combination of trade exhibits (including a Canadian sculpture of Edward VII carved in butter), wild fairground rides, elephant slides and even a village of huts inhabited by 150 imported Senegalese. The 1908 Olympics were also held on the site, almost as an afterthought. The site continued to host exhibitions, but the sheen faded and the structures were gradually pulled down. The last remaining halls were demolished for Westfield in 2003. The show may be over, but a Japanese garden in Hammersmith park provides a final, surviving glimpse of its wonders.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Tom Bolton is the author of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com\">Vanished City</a></em><em> </em></li> \n <li><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em></li> \n</ul>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432034259760/50d98941-17d6-432d-9280-a362f754a608-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Keystone/Getty","altText":"Chinese Freemason Society in Limehouse, near London's docklands, in 1927.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Keystone/Getty"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435057325104/93d9be19-cd45-4120-9167-ad73343f4fad-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"St Pancras station was opened in 1868, providing a London terminus for the Midland Railway.

Matviyenko<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/03/17/fact-sheet-ukraine-related-sanctions\"> has been subjected to US sanctions</a> since the beginning of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/23/eu-extends-sanctions-against-russia-as-ukraine-conflict-rumbles-on\">Ukraine crisis</a>.</p> \n<p>North Korean analyst John Grisafi, intelligence director of NK News, says that by sending experienced, high-level party members the country aims to do more than just meet and greet. Choe has held multiple senior party posts, Grisafi says, including acting as head of international affairs for the workers’ party.</p> \n<p>“His going abroad suggests more substance than ceremony and he likely has more authority to work out something meaningful and not simply be a token presence,” Grisafi says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9bd11dd0bd6fccaf79913ec186eeb6902c2b13fb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435072143995/306c7903-5c10-41e1-b3a2-133d0af61697-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Senior North Korean military officer Hyon Yong Chol attends the 4th Moscow conference on international Security in Moscow in April\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senior North Korean military officer Hyon Yong Chol attends the 4th Moscow conference on international Security in Moscow in April</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergei Karpukhin/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>North Korea has also dispatched Political Bureau member and secretary of the Party Central Committee Kang Sok Ju to Cuba, <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2015/06/22/North-Korea-sends-envoys-to-Cuba-Russia/9081435018697/\">reportedly to discuss food aid</a>. </p> \n<p>“Kang Sok Ju also has a focus on foreign affairs and is currently international affairs secretary for the party. In many cases with North Korea, the party official responsible for a given issue is usually more seriously influential than their counterpart in the government ministries,” Grisafi said.</p> \n<p>As part of this week’s diplomatic outreach, the DPRK also sent foreign minister Ri Su Yong to Equatorial Guinea, in what is likely the first stop on what KCNA has called a tour of “some African states”.</p> \n<p>The trip to the continent by a high-ranking official is the second of its kind within nine months, after North Korea’s de facto head of state, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/nov/01/north-korea-ebola-virus\">Kim Yong-nam, visited Uganda, Sudan and the Republic of Congo</a> in October.</p> \n<h2>Changing attitudes?</h2> \n<p>But is the famously secretive state really changing its attitude to diplomacy?</p> \n<p> Sources have suggested these trips are a reaction to the opening of <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/23/us-northkorea-southkorea-spies-idUSKBN0P30SV20150623\">a new United Nations office in the South Korean capital, Seoul, </a>tasked with investigating human rights abuses, a move which is reported to have riled the North. <br /></p> \n<p>On Monday the DPRK <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/content/north-korea-withdraws-from-universiade-games-south-korea/2832914.html\">withdrew from an international sporting event</a> to be held in Gwangju in South Korea, citing the new UN office as the principal reason for not participating.</p> \n<p>“The DPRK would not be able to attend the games because of the UN office that is planning an investigation on Kim Jong-un’s human rights violations,” unification researcher Cho added.</p> \n<p>South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo, a national daily newspaper, has suggested that North Korea’s sudden interest in outreach could be a reaction to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/06/22/why-is-north-korea-suddenly-talking-about-the-worst-drought-in-100-years/\">the ongoing drought</a>.</p> \n<p>KCNA and international aid groups have drawn attention to the low rainfall that could have serious impact on the DPRK’s agricultural sector, threatening its already fragile economy.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435070420688/d3dcd31f-5c9e-45f1-bc61-b38524d671c3-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rodong
