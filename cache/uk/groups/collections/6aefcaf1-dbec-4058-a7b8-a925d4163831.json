The most prominent of their number, David Davis, likes the label, so it might just stick: shorthand for those Conservatives compelled by a strong belief in civil liberties and the tradition of ancestral freedoms, enshrined in Magna Carta on the meadowed banks of the Thames eight centuries ago.</p> \n<p>As an animating force, this conviction is more than the heritage-loving sentimentalism to which some Tories are indeed prone. In fact, it may be responsible for some of the new government’s most perilous moments in parliament. For a party that needed the Liberal Democrats to govern in its first term, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/live/2015/may/08/election-2015-live-labour-and-libdems-crushed-in-shock-election-result\" title=\"\">to win a 12-seat majority </a>was a historic achievement. But the scale of that achievement does not alter the brute fact: 12 is only 12.</p> \n<p>I have long urged the Cameron camp to make its peace with Davis, who was raised by a single mother on a council estate, is an experienced businessman and personifies the “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/12/the-guardian-view-on-blue-collar-conservatism-tory-tanks-on-labour-lawn\" title=\"\">blue-collar conservatism</a>” that the prime minister now endorses. But Davis has not been forgiven by the Tory leadership for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2008/jun/12/speeches\" title=\"\">resigning his seat in June 2008</a>, over Labour’s plan to extend the maximum period of detention of terror suspects without charge from 28 to 42 days. Seven years on, he fully expects to be at the heart of one of this government’s first significant defeats.</p> \n<p>To set the scene: Michael Gove, the new justice secretary, has been tasked with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/10/conservatives-to-push-forward-on-manifesto-and-scrap-human-rights-act\" title=\"\">fulfilling the Tory manifesto’s pledge to “scrap the Human Rights Act</a>, and introduce a British bill of rights”. Once enacted, the bill “will break the formal link between British courts and the European court of human rights, and make our own supreme court the ultimate arbiter of human rights matters in the UK”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Runnymede Tories believe that Blair and his successors have exploited the fear generated by terrorism to curtail rights</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Runnymede Tories such as Dominic Grieve and Ken Clarke (both QCs) are not like the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2013/oct/22/john-major-speech-revenge-on-eurosceptic-bastards\" title=\"\">Eurosceptic “bastards”</a> who made John Major’s life a living hell. They do not operate as a cohesive gang or a whipped party-within-a-party – not yet, anyway. Some, such as Jesse Norman, the Tory MP for Hereford and South Herefordshire, want to keep the Human Rights Act. Others are content for it to be replaced by a British bill of rights – provided the bill is sufficiently robust as a bulwark against the over-mighty state. Meanwhile, Dominic Raab, MP for Esher and Walton, Davis’s former chief of staff and author of the Runnymede Tories’ founding tract, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2009/feb/08/assault-on-liberty-review\" title=\"\">The Assault on Liberty (2009)</a>, has been made a justice minister. Has he been bought off by Big Brother, or do the Tory civil libertarians now have a man on the inside?</p> \n<p>All parties are always, to a greater or lesser degree, split, often around many axes. For decades, the Conservatives were divided into “wets” and “dries”, then “Eurosceptics” and “Europhiles”, then socially liberal “mods” and morally upright “rockers”. These bifurcations persist. But the argument that is most intriguing and most fissile today is between the Runnymede Tories and those Conservatives who dislike the human rights industry, or the specifically European variety, or intellectual abstractions in general. The left are natural dialecticians. Most Tories think “dialecticians” are the people you phone when the fuses blow.</p> \n<p>Why has a significant minority of Conservatives become exercised by the risk to civil liberties, and why now? This generation of Conservative parliamentarians was shaped by New Labour, not the cold war. They watched Tony Blair and Gordon Brown regulate, intrude and nurture the nanny state, often in collaboration with Brussels. They fretted as political ambition was given rocket boosters by technology. The new gods were digital, omniscient, swooping through the stratosphere, recording anyone and&nbsp;anything they chose. In the end, Big&nbsp;Brother had come not in the form of “a boot stamping on a human face” but in gigabytes of data unwittingly given by&nbsp;the citizen.</p> \n<p>Related to this is the profound schism within Conservative ranks over the western response to 9/11 and subsequent jihadi attacks. When Blair said after the 7/7 atrocities that “the rules of the game have changed”, many Tories agreed (there are shy neo-cons too, you know). Gove was their natural tribune. In <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/jun/06/michael-gove-trojan-horse-islam\" title=\"\">his book Celsius 7/7</a> he wrote (correctly, in my view): “When a senior law lord such as Leonard Hoffmann can say of attempts to restrain the liberty of Islamist ideologues that ‘the real threat to the life of the nation comes not from terrorism but from laws such as these’, then we know we are living in a land that has still not woken up to the challenge we face.”</p> \n<p>Runnymede Tories, in contrast, believe that Blair and his successors have exploited the fear generated by terrorism to curtail rights and augment state power. For them, human rights are both profoundly precious and profoundly British. In 1951, after all, Britain became the first country to ratify the European convention – a text that had been heralded by Churchill and (mostly) drafted by the former Conservative attorney general David Maxwell Fyfe. For Conservatives of this stripe, the convention’s roots, furthermore, lie in the common law of this country and what Burke called the “recorded” rights etched into countless judgments of English courts. They are to be found in the 1689 bill of rights, in Blackstone, and in the work of more recent jurists such as AV Dicey.</p> \n<p>There are serious practical barriers to the scrapping of the Human Rights Act, not least the extent to which it is embedded in devolution legislation and the Good Friday agreement. But the technical aspects of the problem are the least of it. A folk memory of Magna Carta has been awoken that will not galvanise every Tory MP but is strong enough to give the government whips <a href=\"http://www.migrainetrust.org/factsheet-hemicrania-continua-10920\" title=\"\">Magna Hemicrania</a> (look it up).</p> \n<p>As I wrote last week, if anyone has the intellectual firepower to square all the circles it is Gove. He will also need political guile, and confidence that David Cameron will stand by him when things get sticky, which they will. Unfortunately, the justice secretary cannot take this for granted. The manner in which Gove was moved from the Department for Education for doing precisely what he had been tasked to do is one of the worst blemishes on Cameron’s record.</p> \n<p>This is precisely the sort of issue that might unite the opposition parties – so that every single Conservative vote will count. As things stand, the Runnymede Tories would defeat any bid to ditch the Human Rights Act with support to spare. That’s life with a small majority for you. Welcome back to reality, prime minister.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431878003249/David-Davis-with-David-Ca-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Davis, who resigned his seat in 2008 in protest over Labour's record on civil liberties, is the most prominent of the Runnymede Tories.

Sometimes, when the mood took him, Grayson turned himself into a witch but he was a good wizard/witch, even if some of the people didn’t like or understand everything he did. One day, Grayson returned to the land of Essex, in order to build a fairytale house for a princess called Julie on the bank of a river. Julie, also from Essex, had had a humble start to life, but through determination and resilience she’d worked her way up in the world, until her tragic death under the wheels of a pizza delivery scooter. Julie didn’t really exist; Grayson created her – out of clay and all the good women folk of Essex, including his own mother and his own childhood.</p> \n<p>It’s hard not to think of fairytales when you see <strong>Grayson Perry’s Dream House</strong> (Channel 4, Sunday). The building itself looks a bit like a temple – Thai Buddhist maybe, perhaps more Hindu in some of the details. And it should, it is a temple, to Julie, to Essex, to the ordinary woman and thwarted female intelligence. Grayson calls it an “Essex Taj Mahal”, and it is that too, a monument to a dead queen, though this one’s not from Persia but from Canvey Island. It is also, with its brightly coloured ceramic tiles, very Hansel &amp; Gretel.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/may/10/grayson-perry-a-house-for-essex-stonking-shrine\">Grayson Perry’s A House for Essex: a stonking shrine to a fictional woman</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some fairytale themes in the story too: coming of age, and overcoming adversity; a journey, through the county and up the social ladder; transformation, marriage (Julie had a couple of them), beauty, loyalty; intelligence too – she, Julie, Essex woman, easily outsmarts her own stereotype.</p> \n<p>Like fairytales, television about building and making things demands problems and setbacks along the way, before a happy ending. This was probably the least satisfying thing about GP’s DH. During a site visit, Grayson does his best to be underwhelmed and worried for the benefit of the camera and the narrative arc (sorry, hate the phrase). Pah! He knows what it’s going to look like. And a meeting at the Wrabness village hall for residents to express their concerns fails to throw up any of the expected fireworks or outrage from Conservative rural England. They all seem to love the idea of Grayson’s dream house, disappointingly.</p> \n<p>The end of the story though is a joy – six real-life Essex Julies with Grayson, on bicycles, pedaling through the county along fictional Julie’s lifeline, comparing their own stories to hers and to each others. They almost certainly won’t all live happily ever after, but suddenly the whole thing makes sense. And the house? In my expert opinion I’d say it was pretty damn joyous too.</p> \n<p>I’m going to get into trouble for not loving <strong>Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell</strong> (BBC1, Sunday), I can see that loads of people will. I appreciate the sumptuous period drama; I see the craft and extravagance in the production (I did genuinely enjoy the stone statues in York Minster coming to life); I’m both impressed and cheered by the embarrassment of British acting talent on show, a huge and fabulous cast, reins loosened just a little so that they can flirt with caricature; and though I haven’t read Susanna Clarke’s novel, I’d be surprised if it wasn’t respectful, in plot, in tone, in everything.</p> \n<p>My problem is a personal one: fantasy simply isn’t my thing. Magic, faeries, Raven Kings, all that, leaves me cold, and I don’t think any spell’s going to bring me round. Maybe it’s a defect in my own imagination, but while you probably saw a fabulous parallel world of riches and intrigue, I just found it a bit silly, to be honest. So I’ll leave it to those who get it – and wait for the flak.</p> \n<p><strong>The Detectives</strong> (BBC2, Sunday) on the other hand: brilliant. Bleak as hell, we’re with the sexual offences unit of the Greater Manchester Police, following two horrific cases – the rape of a 13-year-old schoolgirl, and abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile’s mate Ray Teret. But I don’t think I’ve ever seen real police work laid so bare like this. Respect to the feds, for transparency. And for the honesty from some of the detectives. Like Carol here, who says that the quality that makes her a good detective is her nosiness. And Christine, who admits how much she loves interviewing suspects.</p> \n<p>No cameras in the interview room itself. Just an audio recording, and some effective use of VU meters. You can see those needles lying.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431700024891/Grayson-Perrys-dream-hous-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Grayson Perry's dream house.

In 1971, I was seven and my form teacher at All Saints Primary School, Miss Jones, would read it to the class at the end of each school day. I was enraptured by it all: Moomin Valley, Moomintroll and Sniff, Snufkin and his pipe and mouth organ, the cantankerous botanist called the Hemulen, the Hobgoblin’s magical hat, and what happened when the Muskrat absent-mindedly dropped his false teeth into it.</p> \n<p>I loved Miss Jones. She was youngish with big henna’d hair, wore black zip-up knee boots and a flashy leather raincoat, and zipped around in a little convertible MG looking like Tara King, the forgotten Avengers girl between Mrs Peel and Purdey. She was my first, delighted encounter with someone exhibiting distinct signs of “raciness”. I always imagined that her life beyond the school gates was like a never-ending episode of Top Of The Pops. For all I know, though, it could have been more like that of her namesake on Rising Damp.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ie8lqrOe_4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ie8lqrOe_4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But she knew kids, and lulled us into daily peaceful acquiescence before knocking-off time with tales from Moomin Valley. And now, all these decades later, after hunting high and low for a copy of my favourite fictional book, The Muskrat’s weighty philosophical tome The Uselessness Of Everything, and with a Moominpappa coffee cup on my mantelpiece, given to me by a Swedish-American ex-girlfriend who looked like Pippi Longstocking, I returned to Moomin Valley in the new animated movie <strong>Moomins On The Riviera</strong>, which evokes a little bit of that enchantment I felt as a child. In it, the Moomins find a wrecked pirate ship in the fjord and use the booty inside to take a posh, mishap-filled vacation in the snooty south of France.</p> \n<p>My only disappointment with the – Jansson estate-approved – movie (which should in no way deter parents) is with the voices and the dialogue. I guess my addiction is to the straitlacedly barmy mid-century English prose of the translator, Elizabeth Portch, and such imperishable locutions as “Well, strike me pink!” or “Bless my tail!” and the song All Small Beasts Should Have Bows In Their Tails (with renditions of which, I confess, I have regaled a number of deeply unimpressed cats). I also missed Moomin Valley in the midsection, and could have used more Snufkin and more Thingamy and Bob, with perhaps an icy intercession by the formidable and terrifying Groke.

Exhibitions draw on the CaxiaForum’s collection from the past 40 years, as well as other museums.

You could be forgiven for thinking they’re basically a very aristocratic equivalent of the sort of letters you read in local newspapers, where some retiree will dedicate many paragraphs to bemoaning the declining state of the flower beds in the local park ever since they <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/brain-flapping/2014/jan/21/how-same-sex-marriage-causes-floods\">allowed homosexuals to marry</a>, or some such thing. </p> \n<p>Such behaviour is almost entirely harmless.

Or, more accurately, his <a href=\"http://www.dcscience.net/2015/05/15/prince-charles-letters-confirm-that-hes-not-fit-to-be-king/\">dislike of it</a>. And when Prince Charles doesn’t like something, he clearly resorts to writing letters about it. What if Prince Charles has also written to scientists to express his wishes too? It’ll probably be another 10 year legal battle to find out what he said (if anything) but you can imagine how scientists, not necessarily beholden to Royal etiquette, may have responded…</p> \n<h2><strong>Physics</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2dfc2210cfd7af34603bcf42f38c39a34a6f9a7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431902495009/476f7297-5776-4cbb-b5e3-8e4aca80bb25-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Physics letter charles\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A physicist writes to Prince Charles.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>Your Royal Highness</p> \n <p>Thank you for your recent letter.

In her best-selling book Charming Bowels, microbiologist Giulia Enders explains how to go to the loo</p>","byline":"Annalisa Barbieri","body":"<p>In my large Italian family, I grew up with the subject of poo, bottoms and constipation readily – and far too frequently – discussed at the dinner table. I’d be about to raise a raviolo to my mouth, only to hear how someone’s piles had popped, just that morning.</p> \n<p>This doesn’t mean I’m anal (sorry) about the subject. It’s fascinating away from the lunch table. Late last year, I read that we are pooing all wrong: we should be squatting, not sitting, on a toilet bowl. Then a book called <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/may/07/gut-reaction-book-digestive-tract-german-bestseller\">Charming Bowels by Giulia Enders</a> caused something of a storm in its native Germany and I got fully immersed in the subject.</p> \n<p>Enders is studying in Frankfurt for her medical doctorate in microbiology. She is utterly, charmingly obsessed with the gut, gut bacteria and poo. She writes and talks about her subject matter with such child-like enthusiasm, it’s infectious. And, yes, we have been pooing all wrong. Enders tells me about various studies that show that we do it more efficiently if we squat. This is because the closure mechanism of the gut is not designed to “open the hatch completely” when we’re sitting down or standing up: it’s like a kinked hose. Squatting is far more natural and puts less pressure on our bottoms. She says: “1.2 billion people around the world who squat have almost no incidence of diverticulosis and fewer problems with piles. We in the west, on the other hand, squeeze our gut tissue until it comes out of our bottoms.” Lovely.</p> \n<p>But not to worry. Although you can climb on your toilet seat and squat (“It might be fun!”), we can iron out the kink by sitting with our feet on a little stool and leaning forward. The book even has a helpful drawing by Enders’ sister.</p> \n<p>Then there are the sphincters. One of them we probably all know about – the one we open consciously – but there is also another, inner one, which is operated unconsciously. This <em>ani internus</em> sends a sample into the chamber between the inner and outer sphincter for the sensor cells to analyse and decide if it’s “safe” to fart or poo: “Yes, you’re at home. No, you’re in the office.” If it’s not safe, the sensors send it back in. But, if the inner sphincter is ignored enough times – say, because we are too shy to go to the loo for fear of being overheard – it sulks and can switch off. That’s one of the reasons constipation can occur.</p> \n<p>Enders loves her inner sphincter. “Learning about those two sphincters really changed my perspective on life,” she says. “Those inner nerves don’t care for other people; they have no eyes or ears. Finally, something that only thinks of me! So, now I can go to the toilet anywhere. I worship that muscle!”</p> \n<p>But the gut – and Enders’ book – is about far more than poo (although there is plenty there, about consistency, frequency, buoyancy, colour and laxatives, to keep the most forensic of scatologists happy). Enders’ big thing is bacteria. Our gut, which comprises two-thirds of our immune system, is full of the stuff. Two kilos’ worth, in fact. Our bacteria fight pathogens, are involved in blood-group development, digest our food, extract energy, produce hormones and can affect our mood. This gut/brain connection is a fairly new area of medicine, which Enders is very excited about. And she’s not alone: the American biochemist <a href=\"http://biomedsci.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_descrip.aspx?id=339\">Rob Knight</a> told <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/index.html\">science journal Nature</a> that the field “offered at least as much promise as stem-cell research”.</p> \n<p>“There is an increasing interest in the gut microbiota and health and disease,” confirms Dr Ayesha Akbar, consultant gastroenterologist at <a href=\"http://www.stmarkshospital.org.uk/\">St Mark’s hospital in London</a>. “There is a huge number of gut bacteria which, in health, maintain a balance. However, an imbalance has been linked to many chronic disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease and obesity. There is a suggestion that they may also be linked to psychiatric disorders and mood, with the majority of evidence coming from animal studies. Further research needs to be performed in humans in this area.”</p> \n<p>Enders’ own interest in this link started when she was a new student. She met a man at a party whose breath was “the worst I have ever smelled – almost faecal”. The next day, he killed himself. “Could a diseased gut,” she wonders, “also have affected his psychological state?” She is keen, though, to point out that depressive disorders are multifactorial and not always connected to the gut; much more research is needed. The first human study of the effect of intestinal bacteria on the brain was only conducted only two years ago.</p> \n<p>Enders admits that writing about a possible connection between our psychological state and the gut was “the hardest part of the book for me. A professor would have been scared of putting it in the book, but I feel people are being robbed if they don’t know about this research.”</p> \n<p>As well as some serious issues, there are plenty of entertaining nuggets in the book. Did you know that our spit contains a painkiller more powerful than morphine: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opiorphin\">opiorphin</a>? We have it only in minute quantities, so that we’re not off our heads all the time. Eating, though, releases more of the chemical and Enders wonders if this is one factor in comfort eating. And guess what? Your appendix – that bit of people always say is of no use – is actually made entirely of immune tissue and is a veritable larder of the best, most useful bacteria for the gut.</p> \n<p>Enders’ book is full of stuff like this. I hate to say it, but it is the perfect toilet book. Thankfully, it has also been translated into Italian, so that’s Christmas sorted.</p> \n<p><em>Gut: The Inside Story of Our Body’s Most Under-rated Organ by Giulia Enders (Scribe, &pound;14.99).
