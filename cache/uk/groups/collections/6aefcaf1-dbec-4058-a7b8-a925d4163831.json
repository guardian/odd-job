Lloyd told him to stay home.</p> \n<p>He had to watch her score a hat-trick and lift the trophy on television instead.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/jul/05/womens-world-cup-2015-final-usa-v-japan-live\">Women's World Cup 2015 final: USA beat Japan 5-2 – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“My fiance was coming, until I made sure he wasn’t. It’s just so demanding mentally – I feel more mentally zapped right now than physically,” Lloyd said after the match. “I want him here now to celebrate, but I just had to focus.”</p> \n<p>Sunday was a rematch of the 2011 Women’s World Cup final, and a redemption story for the Americans, but all of that melted away as Lloyd put on the kind of performance that requires someone to be completely in the zone. What had gone before between these two teams didn’t matter in the end: Lloyd wrote her own history.</p> \n<p>Buoyed by Lloyd running wild and free in the attack, USA stunned the Japanese. Lloyd scored three times in just 16 minutes to propel the Americans to a 5-2 win and their first World Cup in 16 years, their third overall.</p> \n<p>Lloyd’s final goal of the evening was her most audacious, and encapsulated the hold the Americans had on the match. She noticed goalkeeper Ayumi Kaihori way off her line, and launched the ball from just inside the Japanese half. Kaihori got her fingertips on it but it ricocheted off the post and in.</p> \n<p>“Carli Lloyd? Give me a break,” said a gushing captain Abby Wambach, who plans to retire before the next tournament. “I’ve seen it first-hand how hard she works. She won us this World Cup.”</p> \n<p>This wasn’t the first time Lloyd had punished Japan. In the 2012 Olympics, she scored both of USA’s goals to clinch the gold medal 2-1.</p> \n<p>“She always does this to us,” Japan coach Norio Sasaki said. “In London, she scored twice. Today, she scored three times. So, we’re embarrassed, but she’s an excellent player.”</p> \n<p>Lloyd’s first two goals at BC Place came from set pieces, but it wasn’t Japan’s lack of height that hurt them – it was poor defending from clever, low corners.</p> \n<p>On her first, just five minutes into the match, Lloyd shook her defender and ran toward the near post to meet a low, driven ball with the outside of her foot. Two minutes later, defender Julie Johnston backheeled from another corner, and Lloyd smashed it home.</p> \n<p>“I visualized playing in the World Cup final and visualized scoring four goals,” said Lloyd. “It sounds pretty funny, but that’s what it’s all about.”</p> \n<p>Brush fires nearby left BC Place with a smoky haze that smelled like a bonfire and looked like smog, but USA coach Jill Ellis said there was something else in the air.</p> \n<p>“There was this feeling – we just knew,” Ellis said. “I just [knew] that the players could deliver. I told them in the semi-final game that these players are born for big moments; this is what they relish. It doesn’t surprise me that as the games got harder, this team gets better.” Ellis also called Lloyd her “rock star”.<br /></p> \n<p>Lauren Holiday scored a beautiful 14th-minute volley off a loose ball that will be overshadowed by Lloyd’s dazzling performance. Tobin Heath added the US’s fifth and final goal of the match 10 minutes after the half.</p> \n<p>Down four goals early, the Japanese paused, huddled and looked to regroup. They showed a brief hint that they might be able to work their way back into the match, Yuki Ogimi capitalising on some bad defending to score in the 28th minute.</p> \n<p>“The US has studied and improved their set plays and we needed to account for that,” Sasaki said. “We needed to put more emphasis on attacks. We should’ve been more assertive and actively seek[ing] goals.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/usa-win-womens-world-cup-internet-reacts\">Women's World Cup 2015: USA beat Japan – the internet reacts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But they couldn’t test USA goalkeeper Hope Solo enough, officially recording four shots on goal, but a couple of those saves barely stretched Solo. Japan’s second came from a Johnston own goal.</p> \n<p>In an effort to reshuffle his deck, Sasaki used two of his substitutions before the 40th minute was up, bringing on veteran Homare Sawa, who finished her sixth and last World Cup in Japan’s loss.</p> \n<p>Four years ago Japan and USA played to a 2-2 draw, and the Japanese clinched the world title in a penalty shootout. The Americans had been undefeated in 25 prior meetings with Japan going into that final when the <em>Nadeshiko</em> shocked the world.</p> \n<p>The Americans exacted a form of revenge a year later, when they won the 2012 Olympics. But the Women’s World Cup tends to be viewed as the pinnacle by the American players, despite both tournaments featuring most of the same nations and players.</p> \n<p>The prevailing storyline heading into the match was one of redemption and making up for a heart-breaking loss to Japan four years ago. But the team insisted they weren’t thinking about that. All they wanted was to add a third star above their crest.</p> \n<p>“Not 1%,” Lloyd said when asked if she felt any sense of redemption. “It’s a World Cup final that we wanted to win, and it just happened to be against Japan.”</p> \n<p>Going into Sunday’s final, both USA and Japan were unbeaten in Canada with USA ranked No 2 in the world compared to Japan, ranked fourth. Japan had only given up three goals in the entire Women’s World Cup going into Sunday’s rout, where they conceded five. It’s a grim statistic they will never forget.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3482af881794f94acc640ef85a5da8cbbd90f338/0_384_4908_2948/4908.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2948,"width":4908,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ronald Martinez/Getty Images","altText":"USA lift the trophy after their 5-2 win over Japan.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ronald Martinez/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T03:32:36Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T04:15:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":574,"contributors":[{"name":"Caitlin Murray","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caitlin-murray"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["USA women's football team","Women's World Cup 2015","US sports","Football","Sport","Women's football"],"tags":[{"id":"football/usa-womens-football-team","webTitle":"USA women's football team"},{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caitlin Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/caitlin-murray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/usa-womens-world-cup-champions-japan","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ad4d","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jul/05/usa-womens-world-cup-champions-japan","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/05/usa-womens-world-cup-champions-japan"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3482af881794f94acc640ef85a5da8cbbd90f338/0_384_4908_2948/4908.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2948,"width":4908,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"USA lift the trophy after their 5-2 win over Japan.

Sudoku then became a worldwide craze.</p> \n<p>Now there’s a new one with similar aspirations. <strong>Hidato</strong> is the creation of Israeli inventor Gyora Benedek. (The name comes from <em>hida</em>, the Hebrew for riddle.)</p> \n<p>The aim of Hidato is to fill the cells with consecutive numbers from1 to the highest number (both of which are circled) so that consecutive numbers connect. In other words, 1 must be next to 2, which must be next to 3, which must be next to 4, and so on.</p> \n<p>More simply: find the path from 1 to the highest number that covers the grid entirely.</p> \n<p>Like Sudoku, every Hidato has a unique solution and it can be deduced using logic. The small ones are fairly easy, but the larger ones are quite challenging. Give them a go!</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8a73d89084c407137bcc78d99a7e99fd22f21b26\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435931549468/b4908223-af62-425b-9cc6-040a4cbac141-460x419.png\" alt=\"A little trickier.

On seeing a sudoku puzzle shortly afterwards the idea popped into his mind of a puzzle where you had to reconstruct the path of the fish from some given positions.</p> \n<p>Benedek’s first Hidatos used a square grid. These ones already appear in newspapers around the world, and he has published several books of them. But recently Benedek started to design the puzzle using hexagons, which he calls beehive Hidato. I think they are much prettier, and produce more options for the paths.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de6f01e6c10ba6bbf351ec058c3e4a7dade58d8d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435501263742/08bb02e1-02f7-4e80-9478-2b9a2ddcdea5-bestSizeAvailable.png\" alt=\"Hidato 3: now we're getting there.\" width=\"449\" height=\"404\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Now we’re getting there.

No meat, eggs or diary – nothing that comes from animals. Is there anything interesting left to eat? Yes, there’s lots – according to vegans – including chickpeas, kidney beans, fortified soy products, fruit and nuts. So this week’s research linking vegan diet and weight loss is a triumph for the tofu burger. Vegetarian diets have previously been linked with a reduced risk of Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and dying from pretty much everything. But, more importantly – at least as far as summer magazine issues go – vegan diets haven’t been strongly linked with weight loss. This is partly because studies on weight loss and varities of vegetarianism have been small, lasted varying amounts of time and the subjects studied haven’t stuck to their diets.</p> \n<h2><strong>The solution</strong></h2> \n<p>This new study, a meta analysis published in the <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11606-015-3390-7\" title=\"\">Journal of General Internal Medicine</a>, adds up the results of the best studies that compare weight loss in vegetarian and non-vegetarian diets, and also lacto-ovo vegetarians (who drink milk and eat eggs) and vegans. The studies included 1,151 dieters who had followed a regime for between nine and 74 weeks. The diets included the Atkins diet and those recommended by the <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/\" title=\"\">American Diabetes Association</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health-pro/guidelines/current/cholesterol-guidelines/final-report\" title=\"\">US&nbsp;National Cholesterol Education Program</a>. Those who followed a vegetarian diet lost an average of 1.48kg more than those on other diets, while vegans lost 2.52kg more than the non-vegetarian dieters. The lead author, Ru-Yi Huang, says that wholegrain products that are rich in fibre may cause the stomach to delay in emptying and therefore delay feelings of hunger. Some of the individual pieces of research within the meta analysis had more dramatic evidence of weight loss – one study found a weight loss of 10kg at a year and 8kg at five years in vegetarians. A <a href=\"http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/4/2/e003505.full\" title=\"\">study in BMJ Open</a> of 39 overweight people found that an “Eco-Atkins diet” – a low-carbohydrate vegan diet (with protein from soy and nut products) – led to 6.9kg weight loss over six months as well as lower cholesterol levels.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/vegetarianfoodfacts.pdf\" title=\"\">The British Dietetic Association</a> says that vegetarian and vegan diets are suitable for every stage of life as long as they are well planned. There are many ways to lose weight, all of which involve eating less or at least expending more energy than you take in. Becoming a vegan is usually a lifestyle choice rather a diet – one that people make for many reasons, and feeling better in a two-piece is perhaps not the most common one.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435933964817/Should-I-go-vegan-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A fibrous vegan diet could help delay feelings of hunger.

A group of students, male and female, dolled up and headed for a nightclub to celebrate the end of their exams. But it was an eye-opener, she told me, and not in a good way. Three members of the group were denied entry at the door: the only black, male students. When the group asked why, the bouncer – gatekeeper, arbiter, paveside general – characterised this frustration and reasonable request for information as aggression.</p> \n<p>Disappointed, but keen not to ruin the event for everyone else, the barred trio hung around to watch as others in the line behind them were permitted entry. Then, older, wiser, sourer, they headed home.</p> \n<p>Maybe they were unlucky, but maybe not, for there seems to be a lot of this about. Recently, the black newspaper the Voice addressed the issue with a front-page headline: <a href=\"http://www.voice-online.co.uk/article/no-hoods-no-trainers%E2%80%A6no-black-people\" title=\"\">“No Hats, No Hoodies ... No Black People?”</a></p> \n<p>The paper highlighted again the experience of a student who filmed his encounter with a paveside general outside a club in the Midlands. “Is this because we are black?” demanded the student. “If it was my club I would let you in, but it isn’t,” the doorman replied. When the tape surfaced, an apology followed – which tells us that even the paveside general answers to someone. What’s going on?</p> \n<p>There is, of course, the hoary old stereotype that too many black adolescents in one place raises the prospect of disturbance. There is perennially talk of quotas. But, without formal complaints and investigations – perhaps by way of undercover mystery shopping – these things are fiendishly hard to prove. And even when a venue’s unacceptable behaviour is proven, the club can always blame the paveside deity. So, effecting change is tricky.</p> \n<p>Last month, Lee Jasper, the equalities activist and once adviser to a mayor of London,<a href=\"http://www.obv.org.uk/news-blogs/racism-doors-british-nightclubs\" title=\"\">called on councils that issue nightclub licences to step up</a>. “If any club is found to be discriminating, whether informally or formally, they should lose their licence automatically,” said Jasper.</p> \n<p>Indeed that would concentrate minds.</p> \n<p>The Voice, meanwhile, asks those who have been turned away, – as well as doormen tasked with policing discriminatory door policies – to tell their stories. More light, more transparency, and probably more citizen intervention. If the authorities don’t name and shame the establishments with dodgy door policies, wronged clubbers with cameraphones undoubtedly will.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435936867377/No-hats-no-hoodies-...-no-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"No hats, no hoodies ... no black people?

That is full circle.”</p> \n<p>Hoffman, currently starring in drama The Choir, said he was struggling to find his next directing role after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2012/dec/27/quartet-review\">making his debut on 2012’s Quartet</a>. “I’m looking at everything that comes to me, I’m not getting much as far as directing is concerned,” he said. “I don’t think that has anything to do with whether you are good or not, it’s just about whether your films make money or not.”</p> \n<p>Quartet’s musical theme offers a clue as to the actor-director’s true passion: he said he regretted failing to become a professional pianist rather than appearing on camera.</p> \n<p>“I love it more than anything,” said Hoffman. “But I can’t play well enough to make a living out of it. If God tapped me on the shoulder right now and said ‘no more acting, no more directing, but you can be a decent jazz pianist’... I could never read music gracefully. I don’t have a good ear.

As vasectomy becomes less popular, could new methods including a testes-shrinking drug provide reliable, reversible birth control for men?</p>","byline":"Ann Robinson","body":"<p>There are, despite an ancient and colourful history, only three forms of male contraception: condoms, withdrawal and vasectomy. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23671357\" title=\"\">The first condoms were used by Pasiphae, wife of King Minos of Crete</a>, who used a goat’s bladder in her vagina to protect against his sperm, which was said to contain scorpions and serpents that killed his mistresses. The withdrawal method got bad press in the bible when Onan withdrew and spilt his seed rather than impregnate his widowed sister-in-law, Tamar. God was very displeased with this contraceptive method and killed him. Vasectomy was first offered to a man in&nbsp;Indiana in 1899 as a <a href=\"http://www.vasectomy-information.com/history-of-vasectomy/\" title=\"\">cure for his “excessive masturbation”</a> – an alternative to the more conventional treatment of castration. The vasectomy was a great success and the physician reported that the patient “became more of a sunny disposition, brighter of&nbsp;intellect and ceased to masturbate”.</p> \n<p>And we really haven’t progressed much since then. There is still no reversible male contraceptive, apart from condoms. Vasectomy – a surgical procedure, and by far the most reliable of the three – is also becoming less and less popular in the UK according to recent NHS statistics: rates fell from 30,000 NHS vasectomies in England in 2006/7, to 14,000 in 2012/13 (the most recent figures available). And, even if men do want one, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/vasectomies-being-given-the-snip-as-gps-in-essex-told-they-must-ration-number-of-procedures-10245407.html\" title=\"\">provision of vasectomies on the NHS is being rationed</a> in many areas.</p> \n<p>There is clearly a huge gap in the market. New technologies are being developed, but an acceptable, reliable, reversible solution remains elusive. The challenge is that men produce so many sperm – around 1,000 per second. Women, however, only produce one egg per month, so suppressing an egg is always going to be easier than stemming the flood of sperm. And if a decent male contraceptive pill, injection or implant does come along, will men use it? In a study of attitudes to a male pill by men and women, both sexes were positive – though, unsurprisingly, women were more enthusiastic than men. Men in stable relationships were more receptive than men in casual sexual relationships and men with healthy lifestyles were more positive than less healthy men.</p> \n<p>There’s still time for those men to change their minds, though, as it will be a while before this range of promising ideas will be fully developed:</p> \n<h2><strong>The injection</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.parsemusfoundation.org/vasalgel-home/\" title=\"\">Vasalgel is a polymer gel</a> injected into the vas deferens (sperm duct) via the scrotum. It blocks sperm but lets the rest of the fluid ejaculate through, so it doesn’t protect against sexually transmitted diseases. A second injection dissolves and flushes out the gel, offering a potentially permanent but reversible method. Vasalgel is similar to a compound called Risug (or “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reversible_inhibition_of_sperm_under_guidance\" title=\"\">reversible inhibition of sperm under guidance</a>”) that is being trialled in India and appears to be safe and effective for humans, though Risug may never attract enough funding to come to market. Vasalgel has been tested on rabbits and primates and clinical trials are due to start in early 2016 – in the US, 26,000 men are on a waiting list to take part.</p> \n<h2><strong>The clean-sheets pill</strong></h2> \n<p>A drug is being developed in the UK based on phenoxybenzamine and thioridazine, which have been found to stop muscle contraction in the vas deferens so that sperm isn’t pushed forward. The rest of the ejaculate gets stalled, too, hence the “clean sheets”. The question is whether men would accept a dry ejaculate or, as one respondent to a survey put it, “all of the twitch, none of the spurt”. This method could also <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15893119\" title=\"\">reduce transmission of HIV</a> and deserves more attention but, again, funding is a problem. John Guillebaud, emeritus professor of family planning and reproductive health at University College London, says <a href=\"http://www.malecontraceptive.org/#!clean-sheets-pill/c1u8o\" title=\"\">the team needs funding for studies in rams</a>, then further trials if results are positive. “The fastest likely [development] is 10 years.” The idea is for a pill that men can take two to four hours before sex. “That’s fine for many,” says Guillebaud, but “might lead to conceptions when extra-frisky couples can’t wait that long” – they would be advised to use condoms until the pill kicks in. An implant version would give a longer-lasting effect, but normal semen would be restored within days of stopping the drug, but trials would be needed to test that.</p> \n<h2><strong>The herb</strong></h2> \n<p>This is a male contraceptive pill based on the active ingredient of <a href=\"http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2014/05/11/papua-s-humble-gendarussa-plant-may-provide-male-pill.html\" title=\"\">gendarussa, a shrub native to Indonesia</a>, where the drug has been developed. It works by blocking the enzyme that allows a sperm to penetrate an egg. Although further trials into effectiveness, dosage and safety are needed, trials involving about 300 men who took the extract for one to four months resulted in only one pregnancy.</p> \n<h2><strong>The implant</strong></h2> \n<p>A drug <a href=\"http://www.malecontraceptive.org/#!eppin/ck9h\" title=\"\">(anti-Eppin) binds to a protein on sperm (Eppin)</a>, and stops the sperm swimming towards the egg. Anti-Eppin could be delivered through an implant under the skin or orally. Tests assessing the drug’s safety are yet to be undertaken, but Dr Michael O’Rand, <a href=\"http://eppinpharma.com/about-us/\" title=\"\">president of EppinPharma</a>, the pharmaceutical startup developing the drug, says: “When we finish toxicology and non-human primate testing, we will be ready for a phase one human trial. However, this is several years away.”</p> \n<p>He adds: “I&nbsp;would definitely take it.”</p> \n<h2><strong>The genetic drug</strong></h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(12)00929-4\" title=\"\">JQ1 is a drug that turns off the BRDT gene</a> responsible for sperm production in the testes. In animal studies, the drug takes six weeks to achieve temporary infertility and one to three months for fertility to return when the drug is stopped. Testicular size is reduced, but hormone levels and mating patterns are unaffected. It remains to be seen whether it will make human testes shrink and whether men would mind if it does.</p> \n<h2><strong>The hormonal pill</strong></h2> \n<p>Pills that combine two sex hormones (androgens and progestogens) act on the brain to shut down natural hormones that stimulate the testes to produce sperm. Tests have proved effective but have raised side-effects such as liver damage and variable effectiveness, especially between different ethnic groups.</p> \n<h2><strong>The “bright” pill</strong></h2> \n<p>A compound that temporarily inhibits the reproductive capacity of sperm has been developed by Professor Haim Breitbart (the pill’s name is a play on his surname) of Bar Ilan university in Israel. The drug makes mice infertile for one to three months, depending on the dose, with no impact on sex drive. “The mice behaved nicely; they ate and had sex. They were laughing and everything,” said Breitbart to the online magazine Popular Science. However, the professor says there is little chance of further development for now.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435941872138/Colored-Condoms.-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There is clearly a huge gap in the market and an acceptable, reliable, reversible solution remains elusive.
