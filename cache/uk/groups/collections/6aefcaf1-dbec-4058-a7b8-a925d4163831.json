The rebels had been shooting down Ukrainian military planes in the area in the preceding days.” <br /></p> \n<p>The terrible truth soon became clear as dazed residents of Petropavlovka and other villages surveyed the fields around them. The remains were from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which had apparently been shot out of the sky with a surface-to-air missile. All 298 people on the Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur flight died. </p> \n<p>In the nearby fields, there were human remains: sometimes mangled limbs, sometimes intact bodies. There were also all the accoutrements of modern air travel strewn on the ground.<br /></p> \n<p>“People started bringing letters, medicines, suitcases, all kinds of personal possessions. Many people just came to be here and talk, because they were scared to go home. There were pieces of plane, overhead panels, everything. It was awful,” said Voloshina. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"MH17 map\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436428994231/ukraineMH17grabovo.png&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>It took rescue workers several days to fill bags with the bodies: black for whole bodies and green for parts. The cleanup mission was complicated by the fact that the plane fell in territory controlled by the pro-Russia rebels, where Ukraine had lost its sovereignty. The crash site was never properly sealed off, and rumours spread of looting and interference at the scene. </p> \n<p>A year later, there has been no conclusive proof of who was responsible, though most evidence points to separatist forces shooting down the plane by accident with a Buk missile system, possibly brought across the border from Russia. Messages appeared on social media from an account linked to the rebels saying they had shot down a Ukrainian plane, but were swiftly deleted.</p> \n<p>Russia has furiously denied accusations that pro-Moscow rebels were responsible. Russian media suggested the plane had been shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet, and even produced witnesses who had supposedly seen the plane being tailed before being downed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b7dfefbf1d05d093b66ebfa2bea351f5eb45791b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436195634912/11844d99-72f3-4e57-a7fa-714bee6f9462-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pro-Russia separatists stand guard at crash site\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Armed pro-Russia separatists stand guard as monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and members of a Malaysian air crash investigation team inspect the crash site.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mostly the pro-Russia forces denied ever having used a Buk, though one leader, Alexander Khodakovsky, told Reuters he believed the separatists had taken control of such a system from Russia.</p> \n<p>“That Buk I know about. I heard about it. I think they sent it back. Because I found out about it at exactly the moment that I found out that this tragedy had taken place,” he said last summer.</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Guardian in Donetsk last week, he was more circumspect. “There was all the fuss about the Buks which were maybe there or maybe weren’t there, but honestly I can’t say anything with clarity because I didn’t see anything and didn’t hear anything. Recently, in order to stop any insinuations, I have tried not to talk about that theme.”</p> \n<p>The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic was more blunt. “I have said several times that we did not shoot down the Boeing,” said Alexander Zakharchenko from his office in central Donetsk. “We never had this kind of missile system. The Ukrainian army had a Buk. And so with a calm conscience we will happily receive any mission that wants to look into it.”</p> \n<p>But Khodakovsky pointed out that the rebels last summer were still made up of several disparate groups with no central command.</p> \n<p>“At that time it was chaotic here. One division didn’t know what the others were doing. We were sitting here and were responsible for our tasks; those who were elsewhere had other tasks,” he said.</p> \n<p>Exactly who was controlling the Buk remains a mystery, although there is some evidence it came from across the border and may have been manned by a Russian crew. In the days after the crash, the Ukrainian security service released what it said were phone taps that implicated a number of separatist leaders, including Igor “the Demon” Bezler, who ran the town of Gorlovka at the time but has now left the region. An <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jul/29/-sp-ukraine-rebel-igor-bezler-interview-demon\">attempt</a> by the Guardian to question Bezler ended with him threatening to kill the interviewer, but one of his former prisoners said Bezler could not have shot down the plane.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"98d2046338d6f792cd3e3b14df67a585c4482b67\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436196648910/d073dfcf-6794-4a3d-bbd8-aa593f44c9f1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"People walk among the plane wreckage\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People walk among the plane wreckage near the village of Grabovo.

I was there when he was talking about it,” said Vasyl Budik, during a recent interview in the town of Slavyansk, where he works as an adviser to Ukraine’s defence ministry. He spent three months last summer as a prisoner of Bezler in Gorlovka. “When he was told about the passenger plane later, he was going crazy; he understood that there would be major consequences for the rebels. But Bezler had nothing to do with it. He couldn’t believe it.”</p> \n<p>In Moscow, amid public denials of involvement, diplomats scrambled to establish what had happened. A diplomatic source in Moscow said scheduled liaison meetings with counterparts in the Russian foreign ministry were held as planned all last year, with the exception of the week after the MH17 incident. It was almost as though the Russians wanted to get their story straight before meeting foreign officials, the diplomat said.</p> \n<p>On 29 July, 12 days after the incident, an intriguing column appeared in the Kommersant newspaper by the long-time Kremlin pool correspondent Andrei Kolesnikov. With its odd tone purporting to read Vladimir Putin’s mind, it read like no other piece he had ever written.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-442401614__\n</div> \n<p>“If at the end of the day it turns out that the rebels really were responsible for this, this will radically change his attitudes to them,” wrote Kolesnikov, in what appeared to be a carefully calibrated transmission of a message he had been asked to put across. “Even if it turns out to be a fateful mistake. Innocent dead children … this would be a red line for him he could not cross. To cover up for those who did this knowing that they did it. No, this is a sin he could not countenance … Our policy of relations with the resistance fighters would be rethought once and for all. Vladimir Putin would ditch them.”</p> \n<p>That is not what happened, however. Instead, in the weeks after the tragedy, Russian involvement in east Ukraine appeared to intensify. In mid-August, the Guardian <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/aug/14/russian-military-vehicles-enter-ukraine-aid-convoy-stops-short-border\">witnessed</a> a convoy of armoured vehicles crossing the border under cover of night; shortly after, a group of paratroopers were captured by the Ukrainians (Russia said they had “got lost”), and in late August came the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/sep/03/ukraine-soldier-youre-better-clueless-because-truth-horrible-moscow-ilovaysk\">battle of Ilovaisk</a>, where regular Russian soldiers are believed to have taken part, despite Moscow’s denials.</p> \n<p>The Dutch-led investigation into the crash has proceeded slowly, with a full report not expected until October. The investigators are believed to have concluded that the plane was indeed shot down by a Buk missile. Perhaps in an attempt to pre-empt this, the version of a Ukrainian fighter jet has been ditched by Russian media and a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/02/russian-missile-firm-offers-recreate-mh17-crash\">press conference was recently held</a> in Moscow by the manufacturers of Buk systems, Almaz-Antey, in which they claimed investigations showed the plane had been hit by a Buk missile system that only Ukraine possesses. Other investigations, such as by the citizen blogging team Bellingcat, have suggested the Buk came from Russia, and was operated by a Russian military crew.</p> \n<p>There has been talk in the Netherlands and Malaysia about an international tribunal to establish criminal responsibility for the shooting down of MH17.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fbd30a07c9f6e53a8abf487072ad0774764907fd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436196302715/dfd772ec-9fe0-4064-80d1-38af3f902785-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Passengers' belongings at the crash site.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers’ belongings at the crash site.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“No route is 100% perfect, but this is the route that is by far the most preferred,” the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said last week. “We also have plan Bs if this approach doesn’t work, both national and international, but this is the route that would be the best. And that’s why we are exploring that possibility first of all.”</p> \n<p>Russia, however, has described the idea of a tribunal as premature. This week, the deputy foreign minister Gennady Gatilov tweeted: “Russia opposed to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/MH17?src=hash\">#MH17</a> tribunal as politically illogical, unnecessary and complicated to create.”</p> \n<p>On the ground, most of the debris has been cleaned up. In the village of Grabovo, where many of the remains of MH17 fell, and where even a few months ago pieces of the plane’s exterior could still be found scattered in the fields, everything has been cleared away. There is little sign of the horror of a year ago, although villagers occasionally turn up personal possessions in the field.</p> \n<p>A proper clean-up of the plane wreckage only became possible in March, after a shaky <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-crisis-reports-emerge-of-agreement-in-minsk-talks\">ceasefire</a> was signed in Minsk in February. Residents helped collect fragments and belongings from the crash, and in April a Dutch mission arrived to take away everything that had been collected in a big truck, paying residents for their time. M&eacute;decins sans Fronti&egrave;res sent a psychologist to work with the children of the village. Even now, walking in the fields is not safe: just a few weeks ago in a neighbouring village, a six-year-old boy was killed by a mine.</p> \n<p>At the spot where much of the wreckage lay, a small makeshift memorial has been created with a few bedraggled children’s toys and some candles laid on the ground. A placard is mounted on the nearby electricity pylon, bearing a poem in handwritten red block letters: “Pause and pray / Feel the minutes pass / Here fell the Boeing / And in a terrible moment / Their lives were taken.”</p> \n<p>The rebel leader Zakharchenko said he did not know whether there were any events planned to mark the one-year anniversary. “Why are you asking us? Ask the Netherlands. If they want to do anything we’ll guarantee their safety,” he said.</p> \n<p>Voloshina, the mayor of Petropavlovka, said the father of a Dutch victim had visited the area in early June, and had taken soil from the fields in which MH17 had crashed to keep as a memory.</p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b75887b5c7a25045e6cc6eb40b22173999fb9ec8/0_152_3422_2054/3422.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2054,"width":3422,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Flowers and a teddy bear","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436195636377/11844d99-72f3-4e57-a7fa-714bee6f9462-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Armed pro-Russia separatists stand guard as monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and members of a Malaysian air crash investigation team inspect the crash site.

Locals compare its use to coffee, and staunchly defend the coca custom even after it was declared an illegal substance in 1961 by the UN convention on narcotic drugs.</p> \n<p>But cultural use of the drug has remained strong in Bolivia. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/09/its-not-cocaine-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-popes-coca-drink\">It's not cocaine: what you need to know about the pope's coca drink</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bolivian president Evo Morales defended the use of coca – and even farms it himself. </p> \n<p>Morales told a 2007 UN general assembly, “This leaf represents … the hope of our people.”</p> \n<p>As well as warding off altitude sickness, chewing coca leaves (which are held in the cheek) or drinking a brew, just like the pope, provides physical and mental stimulation but nothing like the cocaine high.</p> \n<p>It’s also an ingredient in toothpaste, lotions and shampoo (in Bolivia that is - don’t try to drink your shampoo at home to get high). A 1995 report by the World Health Organisation said there were “no negative health effects” from coca use in leaf form.</p> \n<p>As well as helping the pope get over his altitude sickness, the coca leaf can suppresses hunger, thirst, pain, and fatigue.

The finishing touch is a measure of tobacco that’s been marinating in alcohol for days. Yum. After you’ve chewed it, you spit out the remnants on the street. Don’t freak out – that’s not bloody teeth coming out of your mouth, it’s just the leftover betel leaf ingredients.</p> \n<h2>Kava: the Pacific</h2> \n<p>Kava is not to be confused with the Spanish bubbly of a similar name. The effect of this kava depends, of course, on how much you consume. A little and you’ll be slightly buzzed – a lot and you’ll be smashing up the furniture. </p> \n<p>A crop native to the western Pacific, kava comes from the root of a pepper plant. It has a distinctive taste and a relaxing and slightly numbing effect.</p> \n<p>Like the Bolivians with their coca, Pacific islanders treat kava like drinking tea or coffee - but abuse has lead to <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2015/02/18/islanders-shocked-australia-moves-ban-kava\">Australia banning the importation of kava</a>, angering the country’s Islander diaspora. “Basically what kava does is it compounds existing health and substance abuses issues in the communities, so what it does is it adds one more layer of problems to the community,” said the Northern Territory Police detective superintendent Tony Fuller, head of the Drug and Organised Crime Division.</p> \n<h2>Khat: Africa</h2> \n<p>Native to the Horn of Africa, khat is a flowering plant that in 1980 was classified by the World Health Organisation as a “drug of abuse.”</p> \n<p>Khat contains a<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathinone\"> cathinone</a>, an amphetamine-like<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stimulant\"> </a>stimulant.</p> \n<p>It’s arduous work to get that stimulation though, requiring users to chew on sticks, said to give a feeling of excitement and euphoria. </p> \n<p>But our khat tester believes you’d have to chew a proverbial forest to get any sort of high. </p> \n<p>He recalls: “We paid $50 for a bundle of sticks (in London, where it was legal) and we chewed all night. It was only after 20 minutes gnawing that we felt any effect. It was like a mild painkiller or relaxant.”</p> \n<p>Although you are advised not to drive after chewing it, our khat user said, “I don’t think it would be possible to overdose.

He’d been working on the project for more than eight years. As well as directing, he’d written the script (along with Joe Cornish) and was a co-producer. Key crew went with him.</p> \n<p>You’d forgive a studio for panicking. Marvel, however, didn’t. They barely blinked. It was, after all, as they stressed at the time, a joint decision, triggered by a last minute emergence of “creative differences”. An alternate director was installed (Yes Man’s Peyton Reed), likewise other team members. The script was tweaked and the shoot went ahead as planned. They didn’t even move the release date. </p> \n<p>If ever there was an outfit bigger than the talent it employs, it’s Marvel. Their slate is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/apr/04/marvel-movie-masterplan-2028-president-kevin-feigle-comic-book\">already scheduled through to 2028</a>, and probably beyond. It has a master-plan, a road map for its cinematic universe, and it’s damned if it’s going to deviate – regardless of whether a film-maker who devoted nearly a decade to it is onboard or not.</p> \n<p>So: can you tell? Can you ever. Ant-Man is a cut-and-shut muddle, haunted by a ghost, produced by a high-end hot dog factory, by turns giddying and stupefying. Watching it is like channel-surfing between Hot Fuzz, a duff early 90s Michael Douglas drama and the very schlockiest bits of Interstellar. </p> \n<p>Our hero is Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), fresh out of prison, a low-rent Robin Hood now determined to go straight for the sake of his young daughter. But he struggles to find work and so is persuaded by his – slightly questionably ethnic – criminal chums (one Italian, one Hispanic, one African-American, all bumbling wrong-uns) to break into the safe of millionaire Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas). </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWdKf3MneyI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pWdKf3MneyI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But it’s a setup. Hank just wanted to check Scott had the skills required for an important task: to be shrunk via a special suit and then do battle alongside a troop of telepathically-controlled ants. Their target is Hank’s former protege, Darren (Corey Stoll), who’s harnessed this special shrinking tech and aims to use it for nefarious ends. </p> \n<p>So far, so promising. It’s one of Stan Lee’s wackier ideas, inherently humorous rather than hubristic. You can see why Wright might have liked it and what he might have done with it, in part because his hallmark is still all over it. A couple of lovely montages involving Scott’s pal, Michael Pena (the film’s highlight), are straight out of Shaun of the Dead, and climatic fights in a child’s bedroom and a briefcase are brilliantly conceived and wittily realised – a happy mix of left-field invention and mainstream wows. Given the success of last year’s Guardians of the Galaxy, you wonder why quirky seems to have suddenly made Marvel quite so queasy. </p> \n<p>But other scenes are hopelessly inert, sagging beneath the weight of third-rate music cues and flaccid blocking. Rudd’s romance with a scientist called Hope (Evangeline Lily) flatter than a jam sandwich; she saddled with bad wig and whiny lines, his wryness sometimes a touch too remorseless. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64eb9d638a5db83739c9339d41d503bed202ee10\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436371939592/b0e13996-3acb-4eee-beb6-6afd09bca1a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ant-Man\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Douglas, too, is on muted form – as mad scientists go, this one’s mighty bland. Stoll plays things <em>very</em> straight as Darren the baddie, and it’s a shame Judy Greer has gone from interesting indie star to perennially-worried mum (as Rudd’s ex she basically reprises her concerned turn from Jurassic World). Though the child playing her and Rudd’s daughter is appealing, the father/sprog dynamic is just too blunt to affect. </p> \n<p>And it’s in these shameless scenes the film seems most especially to ape Interstellar, especially during po-faced CGI excursions to the “quantum realm”.

This is one of London’s most dangerous junctions for cyclists, and it is not reassuring to see that I am the only woman among five or six men, most of them in Lycra or high-vis jackets astride racing bikes.<br /></p> \n<p>The light turns green and they shoot off, leaving me breathing in diesel fumes behind a 171 bus, which pulls in to a stop as soon as it gets on to the bridge. I go around it, then get caught behind another bus that is signalling right to pull out. I stop to wait, catching my breath, and watch as another cyclist squeezes through the gap between the bus and a cement mixer in the next lane.</p> \n<p>It feels as though you are taking your life in your hands if you are a cyclist in London – especially if you are a woman: of eight cyclists killed on London’s roads so far this year, six were female. The latest to die, 26-year-old <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/cyclist-26-killed-in-bank-tipper-truck-crash-was-newly-married-oxford-graduate-10339057.html\">Ying Tao, was hit by a tipper truck at the notorious Bank roundabout</a> opposite the Bank of England on 22 June. Last month, Esther Hartsilver, a 32-year-old physiotherapist, was crushed by an HGV 100 metres from where she worked at King’s College Hospital. Other female fatalities this year were Stephanie Turner, a 29-year-old physiotherapist, Frederica Baldassa, a 26-year-old Italian fashion designer, 36-year-old Claire Hitier-Abadie of Marylebone, who was on a Santander bike, and designer <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/london-arts-visionary-moira-gemmill-killed-by-lorry-while-cycling-near-lambeth-bridge-10167161.html\">Moira Gemmill, 55,</a> killed on Lambeth Bridge. All <a href=\"http://www.london24.com/news/cycling/london_cycle_deaths_2015_1_3964719\">were hit by lorries</a>. The statistic is made all the more shocking because women make only 26% of cycling journeys in the capital.</p> \n<p>Lilli Matson, head of surface delivery planning at Transport for London (TfL), says this year has been an anomaly: in all of 2014, there was only one woman among 13 fatalities, and for every billion kilometres cycled between 2008 and 2011, 710 men and 580 women were either killed or seriously injured.<strong> </strong>But she acknowledges that the overriding reason women only make up a quarter of London’s cyclists, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2015.1014451\">despite a doubling in the number of people who commute by bike in the past decade</a> or so, is because they fear for their safety.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If there aren’t at least as many women as men, then usually it’s because cycling is not safe enough</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Gil Penalosa</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae65d8554df8c97084d105c3d67df8763b3082dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436263618333/37d91d7e-9b1e-4864-bb70-ece336d91b5f-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Cycling in Copenhagen.

Sustainable transport consultant Alix Stredwick quotes <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441640701806612\">2008 research by the Department for Transport</a> showing that UK-wide, women make 27% of cycle journeys, just ahead of the US at 25%, but below Canada at 30% – and in a different league entirely to Germany at 49%, and Denmark and the Netherlands, where women cyclists outnumber men at around 55%. In many European cities, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2015.1014451\">cycling is also a pursuit for all ages</a> – unlike in UK cities, where it is mainly the preserve of young, fit and white males.</p> \n<p>Stredwick says the gender imbalance in London “reflects the hostile road environment for cycling”. “I’ve come to the conclusion that we get the cyclists we deserve. If we have a street environment that’s hostile, that has no facilities, that has fast traffic with heavy lorries thundering past, we will get low numbers of courageous people, mainly men, on racing bikes and pretty well no one else. But if you provide a street environment where it’s much more egalitarian, where your granny can cycle to the shops safely and have somewhere to park her Dutch-style bike – that’s when we’ll get those kind of cyclists. But you have to be able to provide for them.”</p> \n<p>Gil Penalosa, who runs Toronto-based consultancy 8-80 Cities, describes women cyclists as the “indicator species” for how bike-friendly a city is. “If there aren’t at least as many women as men, then usually it’s because cycling is not safe enough. It’s an indicator that you do not have good enough cycling infrastructure.”</p> \n<p>This can be seen in New York, he points out, where on busy, traffic-clogged Manhattan streets, perhaps 80% of cyclists will be male, while along the five-mile segregated cycle path that runs along the Hudson River, more than half will be women.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f9a5d6524a732117f54dce9aaee597a30f5d6329\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436263700838/8522025d-67aa-4959-9cfd-de6f07f4b73e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cycling along the Hudson River.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women account for around 20% of cyclists in traffic-choked Manhattan – but more than half of cyclists along the Hudson River bike track.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stacy Walsh Rosenstock/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For London, struggling to improve dangerously poor air quality amid increasing congestion, cycling is now being treated as a transport policy priority, a zero-emissions way to take pressure off the Underground and buses, which have seen passenger numbers double since 2001.</p> \n<p>TfL wants to treble the number of journeys by bike in the city from 500,000 to 1.5m a day over the next decade, and double the number of people who cycle as part of their daily commute, transferring to bikes at mainline stations. </p> \n<p>As Johnson says in the introduction to the <a href=\"https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/gla-mayors-cycle-vision-2013.pdf\">Mayors Vision for Cycling in London</a>, “Our routes will specifically target parts of the tube and bus network which are over capacity, promoting transfers to bikes and relieving crowding for everyone. Cycling will transform more of our city into a place dominated by people, not motor traffic.” But he says this will only come about when people feel comfortable doing it in ordinary clothes, astride clunky bikes. “I want more women cycling, more older people cycling, more black and minority ethnic Londoners cycling, more cyclists of all social backgrounds – without which truly mass participation can never come.”</p> \n<p>Matson says improving safety is the main thrust of London’s &pound;913m cycling drive, with a grid of high quality cycle routes crisscrossing the city, using a combination of segregated cycle ways – including the east-west cycling superhighway – and quieter back-route streets that will be well signposted and prioritise cyclists. There are also similar schemes, called “mini Hollands”, being developed in the outer London boroughs of Kingston, Walthamstow and Enfield.</p> \n<p> Safety isn’t exclusively a female concern, she says, but “it is clear that women give safety a much higher priority than men, so we have to have the right kind of infrastructure that’s attractive to them”. She points out that there are also plans to step up efforts to tackle the dangers posed by HGVs. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s a big mistake to exclude over-65s.

But she is not convinced that they will bring about the cycling revolution on London’s streets that the mayor envisages.</p> \n<p> “They are still not planning the kind of dense, direct network that you will see in many Dutch and Danish towns. It needs to be a much denser network than they’re planning at the moment – one where you don’t have one superhighway but a whole network of high quality routes that you don’t have to share with all that motor traffic.”</p> \n<p>She says that TfL’s budget for cycling over the next decade, which works out to around &pound;11 per person per year, is half of what some cities in the Netherlands and Denmark spend. “And they already have good infrastructure. Eleven pounds is much better than we’ve had in the past, but when you consider that we have to catch up, it won’t transform things over night.”</p> \n<p>And while women are an important demographic to target, cycle infrastructure needs to be planned with children and old people in mind as well, Aldred says. She points to a 2010 TfL study, <a href=\"https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/analysis-of-cycling-potential.pdf.pdf\">Analysis of Cycle Potential in London</a>, which excludes over-65s as potential cyclists. </p> \n<p>In Cambridge, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2015.1014451\">which is unique in the UK in having European levels of cycling commuters at 32.5%</a> (compared to about 7.2% in inner London and 3% UK-wide), not only is there gender parity, but a quarter of over-65s cycle-commute. “It’s a big mistake to exclude over-65s. We need them if we are to get those higher levels of cycling.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/mar/24/cycling-near-miss-close-pass-road-rage\">Cycling near misses: ‘You need ceaseless vigilance if you want to stay alive’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> The same goes for children, she says. Only 2-3% of children in the UK cycle to school, compared with 49% of Dutch school children. And since women are mainly responsible for the school run, not being able to cycle children to school and then continue on to work has big implications for traffic congestion at school-run time.</p> \n<p>“From my research, a lot of people might cycle in a bus lane but they wouldn’t want to do that with an eight-year-old child. You need to have quality cycle routes along main roads with plenty of room. You want your person in Lycra to be able to overtake a kid going to school.”</p> \n<p>The Cambridge core traffic scheme, which restricts car use in the city centre and prioritises cycling and public transport, is the main reason cycling rates in that city are so high, says Aldred. </p> \n<p>Bold measures to promote cycling at the expense of other modes of traffic may be needed in London, too, Stredwick suggests. “What politicians are nervous about tackling is the fact that it’s not just about cycling. It’s about how it affects other modes [of transport],” she says. </p> \n<p>Where Stredwick lives, in the inner London borough of Hackney, 15% of commuters now cycle, double the inner London average, but the share of women cyclists is little improved, she says. She puts this partly down to the council’s resistance to segregate bike lanes on main roads, for fear that they will interfere with bus travel and car parking spaces. </p> \n<p>“Maybe we need fewer buses, pumping out diesel particulates. People could get off the buses and cycle instead.”</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Follow Guardian Cities on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/guardiancities\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/guardiancities\">Facebook</a> and join the discussion</em><br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436263486387/d65e819e-da25-4d34-bdf6-96e53923349a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bloomberg via Getty Images","altText":"A cyclist rides a London cycle hire bike along a section of Cycle Superhighway 8.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436263617179/37d91d7e-9b1e-4864-bb70-ece336d91b5f-2060x1373.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1373,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Cycling in Copenhagen.
