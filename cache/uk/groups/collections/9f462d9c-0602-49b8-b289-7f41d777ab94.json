Over her breakfast coffee, she watched the last of Georgia’s hills recede and the red earth appear, and with it tin-roofed houses set in the middle of swept yards, and in the yards the inevitable verbena grew, surrounded by whitewashed tires. She grinned when she saw her first TV antenna atop an unpainted Negro house; as they multiplied, her joy rose.<br /></p>\n <p>Jean Louise Finch always made this journey by air, but she decided to go by train from New York to Maycomb Junction on her fifth annual trip home. For one thing, she had the life scared out of her the last time she was on a plane: the pilot elected to fly through a tornado. For another thing, flying home meant her father rising at three in the morning, driving a hundred miles to meet her in Mobile, and doing a full day’s work afterwards: he was seventy-two now and this was no longer fair.</p>\n <p><br />She was glad she had decided to go by train. Trains had changed since her childhood, and the novelty of the experience amused her: a fat genie of a porter materialized when she pressed a button on a wall; at her bidding a stainless steel washbasin popped out of another wall, and there was a john one could prop one’s feet on. She resolved not to be intimidated by several messages stenciled around her compartment – a roomette, they called it – but when she went to bed the night before, she succeeded in folding herself up into the wall because she had ignored an injunction to PULL THIS LEVER DOWN OVER BRACKETS, a situation remedied by the porter to her embarrassment, as her habit was to sleep only in pajama tops.</p>\n <p><br />Luckily, he happened to be patrolling the corridor when the trap snapped shut with her in it: “I’ll get you out, Miss,” he called in answer to her poundings from within. “No please,” she said. “Just tell me how to get out.” “I can do it with my back turned,” he said, and did.</p>\n <p><br />When she awoke that morning the train was switching and chugging in the Atlanta yards, but in obedience to another sign in her compartment she stayed in bed until College Park flashed by. When she dressed, she put on her Maycomb clothes: gray slacks, a black sleeveless blouse, white socks, and loafers. Although it was four hours away, she could hear her aunt’s sniff of disapproval.</p>\n <p><br />When she was starting on her fourth cup of coffee the Crescent Limited honked like a giant goose at its northbound mate and rumbled across the Chattahoochee into Alabama.</p>\n <p><br />The Chattahoochee is wide, flat, and muddy. It was low today; a yellow sandbar had reduced its flow to a trickle. Perhaps it sings in the wintertime, she thought: I do not remember a line of that poem. Piping down the valleys wild? No. Did he write to a waterfowl, or was it a waterfall?</p>\n <p><br />She sternly repressed a tendency to boisterousness when she reflected that Sidney Lanier must have been somewhat like her long-departed cousin, Joshua Singleton St Clair, whose private literary preserves stretched from the Black Belt to Bayou La Batre. Jean Louise’s aunt often held up Cousin Joshua to her as a family example not lightly to be discountenanced: he was a splendid figure of a man, he was a poet, he was cut off in his prime, and Jean Louise would do well to remember that he was a credit to the family. His pictures did the family well – Cousin Joshua looked like a ratty Algernon Swinburne.</p>\n <p><br />Jean Louise smiled to herself when she remembered her father telling her the rest of it. Cousin Joshua was cut off, all right, not by the hand of God but by Caesar’s hosts. </p>\n <p><br />When at the University, Cousin Joshua studied too hard and thought too much; in fact, he read himself straight out of the nineteenth century. He affected an Inverness cape and wore jackboots he had a blacksmith make up from his own design. Cousin Joshua was frustrated by the authorities when he fired upon the president of the University, who in his opinion was little more than a sewage disposal expert. This was no doubt true, but an idle excuse for assault with a deadly weapon. After much passing around of money Cousin Joshua was moved across the tracks and placed in state accommodations for the irresponsible, where he remained for the rest of his days. They said he was reasonable in every respect until someone mentioned that president’s name, then his face would become distorted, he would assume a whooping crane attitude and hold it for eight hours or more, and nothing or nobody could make him lower his leg until he forgot about that man. On clear days Cousin Joshua read Greek, and he left a thin volume of verse printed privately by a firm in Tuscaloosa. The poetry was so ahead of its time no one has deciphered it yet, but Jean Louise’s aunt keeps it displayed casually and prominently on a table in the living-room.</p>\n <p><br />Jean Louise laughed aloud, then looked around to see if anyone had heard her. Her father had a way of undermining his sister’s lectures on the innate superiority of any given Finch: he always told his daughter the rest of it, quietly and solemnly, but Jean Louise sometimes thought she detected an unmistakably profane glint in Atticus Finch’s eyes, or was it merely the light hitting his glasses? She never knew.</p>\n <p><br />The countryside and the train had subsided to a gentle roll, and she could see nothing but pastureland and black cows from window to horizon. She wondered why she had never thought her country beautiful.</p>\n <p><br />The station at Montgomery nestled in an elbow of the Alabama, and when she got off the train to stretch her legs, the returning familiar with its drabness, lights, and curious odors rose to meet her. There is something missing, she thought. Hotboxes, that’s it. A man goes along under the train with a crowbar. There is a clank and then <em>s-sss-sss</em>, white smoke comes up and you think you’re inside a chafing dish. These things run on oil now.</p>\n <p><br />For no reason an ancient fear gnawed her. She had not been in this station for twenty years, but when she was a child and went to the capital with Atticus, she was terrified lest the swaying train plunge down the riverbank and drown them all. But when she boarded again for home, she forgot.</p>\n <p><br />The train clacketed through pine forests and honked derisively at a gaily painted bell-funneled museum piece sidetracked in a clearing. It bore the sign of a lumber concern, and the Crescent Limited could have swallowed it whole with room to spare. Greenville, Evergreen, Maycomb Junction.</p>\n <p><br />She had told the conductor not to forget to let her off, and because the conductor was an elderly man, she anticipated his joke: he would rush at Maycomb Junction like a bat out of hell and stop the train a quarter of a mile past the little station, then when he bade her goodbye he would say he was sorry, he almost forgot. Trains changed; conductors never did. Being funny at flag stops with young ladies was a mark of the profession, and Atticus, who could predict the actions of every conductor from New Orleans to Cincinnati, would be waiting accordingly not six steps away from her point of debarkation.</p>\n <p><br />Home was Maycomb County, a gerrymander some seventy miles long and spreading thirty miles at its widest point, a wilderness dotted with tiny settlements the largest of which was Maycomb, the county seat. Until comparatively recently in its history, Maycomb County was so cut off from the rest of the nation that some of its citizens, unaware of the South’s political predilections over the past ninety years, still voted Republican. No trains went there – Maycomb Junction, a courtesy title, was located in Abbott County, twenty miles away. Bus service was erratic and seemed to go nowhere, but the Federal Government had forced a highway or two through the swamps, thus giving the citizens an opportunity for free egress. But few people took advantage of the roads, and why should they? If you did not want much, there was plenty.</p>\n <p><br />The county and the town were named for a Colonel Mason Maycomb, a man whose misplaced self-confidence and overweening willfulness brought confusion and confoundment to all who rode with him in the Creek Indian Wars. The territory in which he operated was vaguely hilly in the north and flat in the south, on the fringes of the coastal plain. Colonel Maycomb, convinced that Indians hated to fight on flat land, scoured the northern reaches of the territory looking for them. When his general discovered that Maycomb was meandering in the hills while the Creeks were lurking in every pine thicket in the south, he dispatched a friendly Indian runner to Maycomb with the message, <em>Move south, damn you</em>. Maycomb was convinced this was a Creek plot to trap him (was there not a blue-eyed, red-headed devil leading them?), he made the friendly Indian runner his prisoner, and he moved farther north until his forces became hopelessly lost in the forest primeval, where they sat out the wars in considerable bewilderment.<br /></p>\n <p>After enough years had passed to convince Colonel Maycomb that the message might have been genuine after all, he began a purposeful march to the south, and on the way his troops encountered settlers moving inland, who told them the Indian Wars were about over. The troops and the settlers were friendly enough to become Jean Louise Finch’s ancestors, and Colonel Maycomb pressed on to what is now Mobile to make sure his exploits were given due credit. Recorded history’s version does not coincide with the truth, but these are the facts, because they were passed down by word of mouth through the years, and every Maycombian knows them.<br /></p>\n <p>“…get your bags, Miss,” the porter said. Jean Louise followed him from the lounge car to her compartment. She took two dollars from her billfold: one for routine, one for releasing her last night. The train, of course, rushed like a bat out of hell past the station and came to a stop 440 yards beyond it. The conductor appeared, grinning, and said he was sorry, he almost forgot. Jean Louise grinned back and waited impatiently for the porter to put the yellow step in place. He handed her down and she gave him the two bills.</p>\n <p>Her father was not waiting for her.<br /></p>\n <p>She looked up the track toward the station and saw a tall man standing on the tiny platform. He jumped down and ran to meet her.<br /></p>\n <p>He grabbed her in a bear hug, put her from him, kissed her hard on the mouth, then kissed her gently. “Not here, Hank,” she murmured, much pleased.<br /></p>\n <p>“Hush, girl,” he said, holding her face in place. “I’ll kiss you on the courthouse steps if I want to.”<br /></p>\n <p>The possessor of the right to kiss her on the courthouse steps was Henry Clinton, her lifelong friend, her brother’s comrade, and if he kept on kissing her like that, her husband. Love whom you will but marry your own kind was a dictum amounting to instinct within her. Henry Clinton was Jean Louise’s own kind, and now she did not consider the dictum particularly harsh.<br /></p>\n <p>They walked arm-in-arm down the track to collect her suitcase. “How’s Atticus?” she said.<br /></p>\n <p>“His hands and shoulders are giving him fits today.” <br /></p>\n <p>“He can’t drive when they’re like that, can he?”<br /></p>\n <p>Henry closed the fingers of his right hand halfway and said, “He can’t close them any more than this. Miss Alexandra has to tie his shoes and button his shirts when they’re like that. He can’t even hold a razor.”<br /></p>\n <p>Jean Louise shook her head. She was too old to rail against the inequity of it, but too young to accept her father’s crippling disease without putting up some kind of fight. “Isn’t there anything they can do?”<br /></p>\n <p>“You know there isn’t,” Henry said. “He takes seventy grains of aspirin a day and that’s all.”<br /></p>\n <p>Henry picked up her heavy suitcase, and they walked back toward the car. She wondered how she would behave when her time came to hurt day in and day out. Hardly like Atticus: if you asked him how he was feeling he would tell you, but he never complained; his disposition remained the same, so in order to find out how he was feeling, you had to ask him.<br /></p>\n <p>The only way Henry found out about it was by accident. One day when they were in the records vault at the courthouse running a land title, Atticus hauled out a heavy mortgage book, turned stark white, and dropped it. “What’s the matter?” Henry had said. “Rheumatoid arthritis. Can you pick it up for me?” said Atticus. Henry asked him how long he’d had it; Atticus said six months. Did Jean Louise know it? No. Then he’d better tell her. “If you tell her she’ll be down here trying to nurse me. The only remedy for this is not to let it beat you.” The subject was closed.<br /></p>\n <p>“Want to drive?” said Henry.<br /></p>\n <p>“Don’t be silly,” she said. Although she was a respectable driver, she hated to operate anything mechanical more complicated than a safety pin: folding lawn chairs were a source of profound irritation to her; she had never learned to ride a bicycle or use a typewriter; she fished with a pole. Her favorite game was golf because its essential principles consisted of a stick, a small ball, and a state of mind.<br /></p>\n <p>With green envy, she watched Henry’s effortless mastery of the automobile. Cars are his servants, she thought. “Power steering? Automatic transmission?” she said.<br /></p>\n <p>“You bet,” he said.<br /></p>\n <p>“Well, what if everything shuts off and you don’t have any gears to shift. You’d be in trouble then, wouldn’t you?”<br /></p>\n <p>“But everything won’t shut off.”<br /></p>\n <p>“How do you know?”<br /></p>\n <p>“That’s what faith is. Come here.”<br /></p>\n <p>Faith in General Motors. She put her head on his shoulder. “Hank,” she said presently. “What really happened?” <br /></p>\n <p>This was an old joke between them. A pink scar started under his right eye, hit the corner of his nose, and ran diagonally across his upper lip. Behind his lip were six false front teeth not even Jean Louise could induce him to take out and show her. He came home from the war with them. A German, more to express his displeasure at the end of the war than anything else, had bashed him in the face with a rifle butt. Jean Louise had chosen to think this a likely story: what with guns that shot over the horizon, B-17s, V-bombs, and the like, Henry had probably not been within spitting distance of the Germans.<br /></p>\n <p>“Okay, honey,” he said. “We were down in a cellar in Berlin. Everybody had too much to drink and a fight started – you like to hear the believable, don’t you? Now will you marry me?”<br /></p>\n <p>“Not yet.”<br /></p>\n <p>“Why?”<br /></p>\n <p>“I want to be like Dr Schweitzer and play until I’m thirty.”<br /></p>\n <p>“He played all right,” said Henry grimly.<br /></p>\n <p>Jean Louise moved under his arm. “You know what I mean,” she said. <br /></p>\n <p>“Yes.”<br /></p>\n <p>There was no finer young man, said the people of Maycomb, than Henry Clinton. Jean Louise agreed. Henry was from the southern end of the county. His father had left his mother soon after Henry was born, and she worked night and day in her little crossroads store to send Henry through the Maycomb public schools. Henry, from the time he was twelve, boarded across the street from the Finch house, and this in itself put him on a higher plane: he was his own master, free from the authority of cooks, yardmen, and parents. He was also four years her senior, which made a difference then. He teased her; she adored him. When he was fourteen his mother died, leaving him next to nothing. Atticus Finch looked after what little money there was from the sale of the store – her funeral expenses took most of it – he secretly supplemented it with money of his own, and got Henry a job clerking in the Jitney Jungle after school. Henry graduated and went into the Army, and after the war he went to the University and studied law.<br /></p>\n <p>Just about that time, Jean Louise’s brother dropped dead in his tracks one day, and after the nightmare of that was over, Atticus, who had always thought of leaving his practice to his son, looked around for another young man. It was natural for him to engage Henry, and in due course Henry became Atticus’s legman, his eyes, and his hands. Henry had always respected Atticus Finch; soon it melded to affection and Henry regarded him as a father.<br /></p>\n <p>He did not regard Jean Louise as a sister. In the years when he was away at the war and the University, she had turned from an overalled, fractious, gun-slinging creature into a reasonable facsimile of a human being. He began dating her on her annual two-week visits home, and although she still moved like a thirteen-year-old boy and abjured most feminine adornment, he found something so intensely feminine about her that he fell in love. She was easy to look at and easy to be with most of the time, but she was in no sense of the word an easy person. She was afflicted with a restlessness of spirit he could not guess at, but he knew she was the one for him. He would protect her; he would marry her.<br /></p>\n <p>“Tired of New York?” he said.<br /></p>\n <p>“No.”<br /></p>\n <p>“Give me a free hand for these two weeks and I’ll make you tired of it.”<br /></p>\n <p>“Is that an improper suggestion?”<br /></p>\n <p>“Yes.”<br /></p>\n <p>“Go to hell, then.”<br /></p>\n <p>Henry stopped the car. He turned off the ignition switch, slewed around, and looked at her. She knew when he became serious about something: his crew cut bristled like an angry brush, his face colored, its scar reddened.<br /></p>\n <p>“Honey, do you want me to put it like a gentleman? Miss Jean Louise, I have now reached an economic status that can provide for the support of two. I, like Israel of Old, have labored seven years in the vineyards of the University and the pastures of your daddy’s office for you –”<br /></p>\n <p>“I’ll tell Atticus to make it seven more.”<br /></p>\n <p>“Hateful.”<br /></p>\n <p>“Besides,” she said, “it was Jacob anyway. No, they were the same. They always changed their names every third verse. How’s Aunty?”<br /></p>\n <p>“You know good and well she’s been fine for thirty years. Don’t change the subject.”<br /></p>\n <p>Jean Louise’s eyebrows flickered. “Henry,” she said primly, “I’ll have an affair with you but I won’t marry you.”<br /></p>\n <p>It was exactly right.<br /></p>\n <p>“Don’t be such a damn child, Jean Louise!” Henry sputtered, and forgetting the latest dispensations from General Motors, grabbed for a gearshift and stomped at a clutch. These denied him, he wrenched the ignition key violently, pressed some buttons, and the big car glided slowly and smoothly down the highway.<br /></p>\n <p>“Slow pickup, isn’t it?” she said. “No good for city driving.” Henry glared at her. “What do you mean by that?”<br /></p>\n <p>In another minute this would become a quarrel. He was serious. She’d better make him furious, thus silent, so she could think about it.<br /></p>\n <p>“Where’d you get that appalling tie?” she said. <br /></p>\n <p>Now.<br /></p>\n <p>She was almost in love with him. No, that’s impossible, she thought: either you are or you aren’t. Love’s the only thing in this world that is unequivocal. There are different kinds of love, certainly, but it’s a you-do or you-don’t proposition with them all.<br /></p>\n <p>She was a person who, when confronted with an easy way out, always took the hard way. The easy way out of this would be to marry Hank and let him labor for her. After a few years, when the children were waist-high, the man would come along whom she should have married in the first place. There would be searchings of hearts, fevers and frets, long looks at each other on the post office steps, and misery for everybody. The hollering and the high-mindedness over, all that would be left would be another shabby little affair &agrave; la the Birmingham country club set, and a self-constructed private Gehenna with the latest Westinghouse appliances. Hank didn’t deserve that.<br /></p>\n <p>No. For the present she would pursue the stony path of spinsterhood. She set about restoring peace with honor:<br /></p>\n <p>“Honey, I’m sorry, truly sorry,” she said, and she was.<br /></p>\n <p>“That’s okay,” said Henry, and slapped her knee. “It’s just that I could kill you sometimes.”<br /></p>\n <p>“I know I’m hateful.”<br /></p>\n <p>Henry looked at her. “You’re an odd one, sweet. You can’t dissemble.”<br /></p>\n <p>She looked at him. “What are you talking about?”<br /></p>\n <p>“Well, as a general rule, most women, before they’ve got ’em, present to their men smiling, agreeing faces. They hide their thoughts. You now, when you’re feeling hateful, honey, you <em>are</em> hateful.”<br /></p>\n <p>“Isn’t it fairer for a man to be able to see what he’s letting himself in for?”<br /></p>\n <p>“Yes, but don’t you see you’ll never catch a man that way?”<br /></p>\n <p>She bit her tongue on the obvious, and said, “How do I go about being an enchantress?”<br /></p>\n <p>Henry warmed to his subject. At thirty, he was an adviser. Maybe because he was a lawyer. “First,” he said dispassionately, “hold your tongue. Don’t argue with a man, especially when you know you can beat him. Smile a lot. Make him feel big. Tell him how wonderful he is, and wait on him.”<br /></p>\n <p>She smiled brilliantly and said, “Hank, I agree with everything you’ve said. You are the most perspicacious individual I’ve met in years, you are six feet five, and may I light your cigarette? How’s that?”<br /></p>\n <p>“Awful.”<br /></p>\n <p>They were friends again. <br /></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>This is an extract from Go Set A Watchman by Harper Lee, published on 14 July by William Heinemann at &pound;18.99.

And it’s hard to think about this great southern novel simply as a work of art, so soon after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jul/02/us-church-burnings-race-south-carolina\">the horror at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church</a>, and while black churches still burn across the American south.</p> \n<p>To Kill a Mockingbird is an important social document for all sorts of reasons: its context matters. But for now at least, I’m keen to focus on the novel itself. </p> \n<p>Let’s perform a quick thought experiment. How will To Kill a Mockingbird be viewed a few generations down the line? Will it still be read? And if so, why? </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2015/jun/30/to-kill-a-mockingbird-go-set-a-watchman-reading-group-harper-lee\">Looking back at To Kill a Mockingbird, and forward to Go Set a Watchman</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It will explain a great deal about a certain society, but so too will history books and documentary footage. If the novel endures – and surely it must – it will be for other reasons. Similarly, future generations may find the current media storm interesting, but only in relation to the novel itself. The hype over Go Set a Watchman will be a scholarly footnote. Possibly, Go Set a Watchman itself will be a footnote. We’ll see about that soon. Either way, my point is that the text of Mockingbird is a bedrock that will endure long after the tide of history has swept aside most of our current concerns. </p> \n<p>All those millions of new readers who fall for To Kill a Mockingbird every decade don’t just do so because it’s so famous already, or for the moral and societal lessons they pick up from Atticus Finch and the tragedy of Tom Robinson. Those are part of the appeal – but they aren’t what first snags the reader. </p> \n<p>What matters first, of course, is this:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>When he was nearly thirteen my brother Jem got his arm badly broken at the elbow. When it healed, and Jem’s fears of never being able to play football were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious about his injury. His left arm was somewhat shorter than his right; when he stood or walked, the back of his hand was a right-angles to his body, his thumb parallel to his thigh. He couldn’t have cared less, so long as he could pass and punt.</p> \n <p>When enough years had gone by to enable us to look back on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. I maintain that the Ewells started it all, but Jem, who was four years my senior, said it started long before that. He said it began the summer Dill came to us, when Dill first gave us the idea of making Boo Radley come out.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>There are no particular fireworks in those opening paragraphs. That “somewhat “ and “I maintain” may give a fleeting impression of southern formality; more certainly, you get a feeling for the perspective of the narrator, of an adult walking again in a child’s shoes. Subconsciously, you might also register that this is a writer who knows about rhythm, especially thanks to the way she closes the first paragraph with the satisfying heaviness of “pass and punt” .</p> \n<p>At this stage, Harper Lee’s prose is quiet and unassuming. But those first words do something special all the same. There might not be any explosions, but the fuses are set. How did Jem break his arm? What did the Ewells start? Who are the Ewells? Who is Dill? And who on earth – what on earth – is Boo Radley? What does it mean to make him “come out”? </p> \n<p>There are mysteries to unravel – and so, you’re hooked. This is good old-fashioned storytelling: pure, maybe not simple, but certainly elemental. To Kill a Mockingbird taps into some of the longest-running themes in literature – fighting injustice, finding out about the world – and does it well. We read the book because to do so is a pleasure. When I started reading again, I was almost immediately lulled by Scout’s mint-julep voice. And once again I was bowled over by passages like this one:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Maycomb was an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop; grass grew on the sidewalks, the court-house sagged in the square. Somehow, it was hotter then; a black dog suffered on a summer’s day; bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sheltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men’s stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three o’clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>I highlighted that delicious paragraph <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2013/jul/10/to-kill-a-mockingbird-too-simple\">last time we looked at the book in the Reading group</a>. Back then I ascribed its success as much to magic as anything else. I noted the “technical prowess in the imagery (how perfectly all that sagging and wilting leads up to the teacakes)”. I also hit on the “the choice language (notice they are ‘ladies’, not women; look at the hiss and stick of the sibilance, and all those letter ‘g’s in the muddy second sentence)”. But at that stage, I decided it was an “alchemy of mood and voice” that makes the book so effective. This time around, something else stands out for me: the fact that it’s all so visual. All those images are so clear and strong. (Especially if you know that <a href=\"http://www.answers.com/Q/What_is_a_hoover_cart\">a Hoover cart</a> is a converted automobile, pulled by mules.) Harper Lee makes us see through Scout’s eyes. She does it throughout the book. She even reminds us of it. Most famously, here:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>I looked around. They were standing. All around us and in the balcony on the opposite wall, the Negroes were getting to their feet. Reverend Sykes’s voice was as distant as Judge Taylor’s.</p> \n <p>‘Miss Jean Louise, stand up. Your father’s passin’.’</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>We’re there with Scout – but also watching her, looking out. It’s a key to the success of the storytelling, as well as a neat internal commentary on Atticus’s favoured philosophy of walking in someone else’s shoes. It’s the classic “show” rather than “tell” beloved of creative writing handbooks. It makes the world seem real and gives the story weight. </p> \n<p>But there’s something else happening here too. This world seems all the more particular because it is seen through Scout’s eyes, and filtered through her memory. We’re getting a particular view, from a particular place, at a particular time. And it’s Scout’s powerful and individual vision that gives the book so much of its enduring power. We still read To Kill a Mockingbird because there’s nothing else like it, and nor can there be. </p> \n<p>Paradoxically enough, it’s this unique world view that gives the novel such universal appeal. It’s what makes it resonate, and encourages us to dive right in, bringing our own concerns and baggage with us. Maybe future generations will look to the book for solutions to their own problems. But they’ll be there, first and foremost, because they like a good story. </p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0a0be4988e648250b6399a499875d5d36b58c6bf/0_363_4041_2425/4041.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2425,"width":4041,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tristram Kenton for the Guardian","altText":"Eleanor Worthington-Cox (Scout) in To Kill A Mockingbird by Harper Lee @ Regent's Park Open Air Theatre.

Ms. Lee wrote “Watchman” in the mid-1950s, and she set it aside when her editor told her to rewrite it from the perspective of Scout as a child — advice that gave rise to the story that would become “Mockingbird.” When the news of the publication was announced last February, questions quickly arose about why Ms. Lee, who had long claimed she was satisfied with her single contribution to American literature, decided to release it after all this time.</p> \n <p>But whether or not it holds up to her <a href=\"http://nyti.ms/1JYipnh\">Pulitzer Prize-winning debut novel</a>, “Watchman” will offer readers an unprecedented and unfiltered look into the mind and creative process of one of the country’s most revered and enigmatic authors. The novel, however flawed, promises to shed new light on familiar characters, and to offer a rare look at the unedited prose of a writer who was so rattled by fame and the weight of expectations that, for decades, it seemed all but certain that she would never publish another word.</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559f74cde4b05111b7559660","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-10T07:35:35Z","body":"<p>Blowing our own trumpet alert...</p> \n<p>Lots of readers have been impressed by the way Guardian has presented the chapter. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/andrewmcdonald/statuses/619408114526240768\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That Guardian <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoSetAWatchman?src=hash\">#GoSetAWatchman</a> page sets a new standard for book extracts online.

Jean Louise is shown to be grappling with two things as she comes home. Atticus, an almost godlike figure to the Scout of Mockingbird, is now in constant pain. “She was too old to rail against the inequity of it, but too young to accept her father’s crippling disease without putting up some kind of fight … She wondered how she would behave when her time came to hurt day in and day out.”</p> \n <p>She is also pondering whether or not she should marry a childhood friend of her brother’s, who muses ruefully that “most women, before they’ve got ’em, present to their men smiling, agreeing faces. They hide their thoughts. You now, when you’re feeling hateful, honey, you are hateful.”</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559f4e34e4b07fc6a121f608","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-10T04:58:10Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-07-10T05:17:26Z","body":"<p>A few quick reviews from the Guardian Australia staff, who are a tough crowd.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>What can you really judge about a book from one chapter?

He’s shared his thoughts on a favourite quote from the book. </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>One of To Kill a Mockingbird’s most enduring features is Harper Lee’s portrayal of Atticus Finch. He represents the very best of the law and the idea of due process. My favourite scene in To Kill a Mockingbird is Atticus Finch’s powerful courtroom showdown. It’s an incredible moment that has quite probably inspired a generation of lawyers. During the hearing, Finch gets up and says:</p> \n <p><em>“We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe – some people are smarter than others, some people have more opportunity because they’re born with it, some men make more money than others, some ladies make better cakes than others – some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men.</em><br /></p> \n <p><em>“But there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal – there is one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of any Einstein and the ignorant man the equal of any college president. That institution, gentlemen, is a court.”</em></p> \n <p>These lines are as powerful – and relevant – today as they were 50 years ago.</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559f40aae4b05111b7559614","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-10T03:49:42Z","body":"<p>Book people and their jokes, hey?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/twyodor/statuses/619351952170680320\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Q: What does Harper Lee tell people who have no interest in Wimbledon?
