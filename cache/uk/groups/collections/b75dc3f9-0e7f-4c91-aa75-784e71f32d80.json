This is not just ongoing UN discussions. Paris is final.”</p> \n<p>For it to be a success, he said, heads of government – most of whom are not expected to attend the talks in person – must urgently instruct their negotiating ministers to come forward with plans for a deal that would involve cutting emissions, rich countries providing the poor with financial assistance, and putting in place sweeping new measures to help poor nations adapt to the ravages of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/climate-change\">global warming</a>.</p> \n<p>Ca&ntilde;ete said the EU would reject any deal he thought was not ambitious enough in cutting <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/carbon-emissions\">greenhouse gas emissions</a>, a key sticking point in the talks. “For us, it’s very important to have a deal – but not any kind of deal.”</p> \n<p>The commissioner’s tough talking marks a new line from the EU, which has previously been seen as dovish, trying to smooth over differences among developing and developed countries. Ca&ntilde;ete is embarking on an exhausting round of visits to developing country capitals, from Latin America to Papua New Guinea, to try to garner support for a Paris agreement.</p> \n<p>In December, world governments will meet in the French capital under the auspices of the <a href=\"http://www.cop21.gouv.fr/en\">UN to forge a new global agreement on emissions</a>, which would kick in from 2020 when current commitments run out. It is seen as the last chance to put the world on track to meet scientific advice on carbon reductions and avoid dangerous levels of climate change.</p> \n<p>Developing countries form a crucial bloc in the talks, where any agreement can only be formalised by a consensus of all 196 governments. Poor nations are demanding financial assistance to help them cut emissions and deal with the effects of climate change.</p> \n<p>Ca&ntilde;ete promised that the financial assistance on offer would be twofold: first, the EU and other countries will clearly demonstrate how they will honour their existing pledge to provide $100bn (&pound;64bn) a year by 2020 to the developing world in “climate finance”; and second, the Paris talks will agree on a system for providing such finance, in increasing quantities, beyond 2020.</p> \n<p>He has also added a further strand to the talks: he wants a new agreement on measures to provide developing countries with the means to adapt to the likely ravages of climate change, such as droughts, floods and heatwaves. He believes this adaptation strategy, which will focus on protecting key infrastructure, will be crucial to encourage poor countries to make a deal, as they are most at risk of damage from global warming. “We have to put adaptation at the centre of the negotiations, for the developing countries,” he said.</p> \n<p>Despite his reservations, Ca&ntilde;ete said he was “85% confident” that a historic deal on global warming would be agreed in Paris. “There is political goodwill – there is commitment at a high level.”</p> \n<p>What is needed now, in his view, is to turn that commitment into a strong push by heads of state and government to give their foreign and environment ministers – who are the main delegates at the talks – explicit permission to be flexible on their negotiating positions. Without that permission, many negotiators feel bound to stick to their old lines, which will make agreement hard to reach. “Make compromises if needed,” he urged. “If there is a clear political indication [from heads of government] then ministers can come with more ambition.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal\">Low targets, goals dropped: Copenhagen ends in failure</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The EU’s tougher line on the talks follows the hard-won experience of negotiating on climate at the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2009/dec/18/copenhagen-deal\">Copenhagen summit in 2009, which ended in scenes of chaos</a>, with Europe in the final hours frozen out of negotiations, as the US, China, Brazil, India and South Africa announced their own deal in a separate room.</p> \n<p>With only 10 official negotiating days to go before the opening of the Paris conference, officials were hoping to have a key text of a possible agreement in good form by now.

Since the army ousted the Muslim Brotherhood’s Mohamed Morsi from the presidency two years ago, the government has used the pretext of combatting a wave of militancy that has left hundreds of policemen and soldiers dead to unleash a wave of legislation that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/dec/26/sp-egypt-pillars-of-freedom-crashing-down\">legal experts say</a> is the most restrictive since the 1950s. </p> \n<p>Police have also arrested thousands of mainly Islamist opposition members, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/interactive/2013/jul/18/cairo-republican-guard-shooting-full-story\">killed more than 1,000 protesters</a> and curbed the activities of NGOs and political parties.

He is not scheduled to visit his homeland of Argentina, at least partly to avoid any entanglement in this year’s presidential election.</p> \n<p>The pope’s plane landed in Quito, Ecuador, where thousands of people lined a motorcade route that would take the pope to the Vatican ambassador’s residence, where he was scheduled to stay for the first leg of a trip that ends on 13 July.</p> \n<p>Pilgrims came from far and wide. A small group of Colombians set up tents at the former site of Quito’s airport, where the pope is due to say mass on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Francis is likely to raise environmental concerns with Ecuadorean president Rafael Correa and Evo Morales, the leader of Bolivia – both of whom have promoted mining and oil drilling in wilderness areas – given the pope’s recent encyclical on the need to protect nature and the poor who suffer most when it is exploited.</p> \n<p>In that document, Francis called for a new development model that rejects the profit-at-all cost mentality in favour of a Christian view of economic progress that respects human rights, safeguards the planet and involves all sectors of society, the poor and marginalised included.</p> \n<p>In a video message on the eve of his departure from Rome, Francis said he wanted to bring a message of hope and joy to all, “especially the neediest, the elderly, the sick, those in prison and the poor and all those who are victims of this ‘throwaway culture’”.</p> \n<p>Francis’ scheduled stops include a violent Bolivian prison, a flood-prone Paraguayan shantytown and a meeting with grass-roots groups in Bolivia, the sort of people he ministered to in the slums of Buenos Aires as archbishop.</p> \n<p>Crowds are expected to be huge. While the countries themselves are tiny compared to regional powerhouses like Brazil and Argentina, they are fervently Catholic: 79% of the population is Catholic in Ecuador, 77% in Bolivia and 89% in Paraguay, according to the Pew Research Center.</p> \n<p>Waiting for the pope along his motorcade route in Quito, retired schoolteacher Cecilia Alvarez lamented that the visit was being exploited by politicians in Ecuador, where the government has been facing street protests.</p> \n<p>“Francis comes on another mission, in another sense. He comes to make peace,” she said.</p> \n<p>The Vatican said it expected more than a million people to turn out for Francis’ major public masses in each country, and organisers scheduled plenty of time for the pope to meander through the throngs.</p> \n<p>When John Paul II visited Ecuador in 1985, he called for a more just society and reminded indigenous groups of the role played by missionaries who had arrived on the continent centuries before. Francis will likely repeat those messages and pay particular attention to the role his Jesuit order played.</p> \n<p>John Paul’s visits were shadowed by the Polish pope’s concern about the rise of liberation theology; he feared that Marxists were using its “preferential option for the poor” to turn the Gospel into a call for armed revolution.</p> \n<p>Guzman Carriquiri, the No 2 of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America and a top papal adviser, said a less turbulent situation awaited Francis, who has sought to revive a purer, less political version of liberation theology and recently approved beatification for one of its heroes, Salvadoran archbishop Oscar Romero.</p> \n<p>Francis also brokered a historic thaw between the US and Cuba, countries he will visit in September.</p> \n<p>“Francis’ visit will be a huge boost to the priests of the third world and theology of liberation,” said 80-year-old Xavier Albo, a fellow Jesuit. “He lives that theology through mercy, modesty and his obligation to the poor, the immigrants and the imprisoned.”</p> \n<p>Jesuits paid with their lives defending the downtrodden against dictatorships, as the pope knows well from his days as head of the Jesuits during the rightwing military dictatorship in Argentina.</p> \n<p>Opponents of dictatorships in Paraguay and Bolivia were also disappeared. One, who was tortured and killed in 1980, was Father Lu&iacute;s Espinal, a Bolivian close to Albo whose body was dumped by the side of the airport road that Francis will travel on his way into La Paz on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Francis will stop the Popemobile there, get out and pray.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436129247744/0dcefc33-7545-4182-8ebd-fafcf697515c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"pope francis quito ecuador","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rodrigo Buendia/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T21:19:33Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T21:19:33Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Pope Francis","The papacy","Catholicism","Christianity","Religion","World news","Ecuador","Bolivia","Americas","Paraguay"],"tags":[{"id":"world/pope-francis","webTitle":"Pope Francis"},{"id":"world/the-papacy","webTitle":"The papacy"},{"id":"world/catholicism","webTitle":"Catholicism"},{"id":"world/christianity","webTitle":"Christianity"},{"id":"world/religion","webTitle":"Religion"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/ecuador","webTitle":"Ecuador"},{"id":"world/bolivia","webTitle":"Bolivia"},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas"},{"id":"world/paraguay","webTitle":"Paraguay"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/05/pope-francis-south-america-ecuador-bolivia-paraguay","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ad2t","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/05/pope-francis-south-america-ecuador-bolivia-paraguay","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/05/pope-francis-south-america-ecuador-bolivia-paraguay"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436129247744/0dcefc33-7545-4182-8ebd-fafcf697515c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Pope Francis waves at the crowd upon arriving at the Mariscal Sucre international airport in Quito.

The gap is startling,” she said. “There is a moral, rights-based reason why we’ve got to educate every girl, but there’s also a practical development outcomes if we do educate girls.</p> \n<p>“We know that if we educated every girl, we would see infant deaths plummet by 3 million. We know that if women are educated children are more likely to survive childhood, more likely to be vaccinated, that economies grow because women have got the capability to work and direct that financing back to their families. Educating girls is win, win, win all round.”</p> \n<p>Nine in 10 school-age children around the world get a primary education but there are still about 121 million children of primary and lower secondary age who are not in school. Of the 58 million not in primary school, about 31 million are girls.</p> \n<p>Gillard, who is chair of the board of the Global Partnership for Education, said there was a lot of positive energy around the need for more international cooperation on education for millions of unschooled children, led by people such as Michelle Obama, Hillary Clinton and Gordon Brown, who is now the UN special envoy on education.</p> \n<p>“Born of tragedy, there has been a far greater focus by leaders on girls’ education – the shooting of Malala Yousafzai (who will attend the summit) and the dreadful circumstances of the Nigerian schoolgirls – has galvanised the world community.”</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian before the Oslo Summit on Education for Development, Gillard said she was “convinced this is an important moment for everyone to take a big step up”, with discussions on girls’ education, and how to provide emergency schooling for children fleeing conflict zones like Syria. They will also talk about a new financing commission to raise money from donors to leverage national education budgets.</p> \n<p>Gillard, who was prime minister of Australia for three years before being ousted by her predecessor Kevin Rudd in 2013, said her biggest passion was fighting for better education throughout the world now that she had retired from politics.</p> \n<p>“The motivating force throughtout my life and work in politics has been access to education and opportunity so I find it truly heartbreaking that we can look at our world and contemplate that it could be 100 years before girls get basic education, let alone full access to education,” she said.</p> \n<p>As the first female prime minister of Australia, Gillard gained renown for her so-called “misogyny speech”, taking now-prime minister Tony Abbott to task over sexist attitudes.</p> \n<p>Having written a book about her experiences in politics, she has spoken in the past three weeks on a visit to the UK about how women need to call out sexism when they encounter it and argued they must not let it dissuade them from putting themselves forward, especially in male-dominated environments.</p> \n<p>Gillard said fighting for better education for girls was one of the central battles for feminism. “We know at current rate of change it won’t be until the start of the next century that the first cohort of sub-Saharan girls universally get to go to primary school and 100 years is far too long to wait,” Gillard said.<br /></p>","section":"Development","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436089148938/99e15c01-b310-4833-b422-7a6a5bf57a46-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images","altText":"Julia Gillard, Australia's former prime minister.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Bloomberg/Bloomberg via Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T09:49:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T23:00:35Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":363,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Global development","Julia Gillard","Australia news","Norway","Education","Europe","World news","Children"],"tags":[{"id":"global-development/global-development","webTitle":"Global development"},{"id":"world/julia-gillard","webTitle":"Julia Gillard"},{"id":"australia-news/australia-news","webTitle":"Australia news"},{"id":"world/norway","webTitle":"Norway"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"}],"section":{"id":"global-development"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rowena Mason","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rowena-mason"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"global-development"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/05/gillard-urges-action-on-lack-of-schooling-millions-of-children-worldwide","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acnx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/05/gillard-urges-action-on-lack-of-schooling-millions-of-children-worldwide","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/05/gillard-urges-action-on-lack-of-schooling-millions-of-children-worldwide"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436089148938/99e15c01-b310-4833-b422-7a6a5bf57a46-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Julia Gillard says the world is at a pivotal moment in tackling millions of children growing up without basic schooling.
