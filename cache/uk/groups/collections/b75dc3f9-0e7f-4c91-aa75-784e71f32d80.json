But this week the staff there, like so many people across Ireland, have been touched by a tragedy that unfolded in the early hours of Tuesday in the American university town.</p> \n<p>Jack Halpin, a University College Dublin (UCD) student, Gaelic football player and former part-time employee of the Omniplex, was one of a group of young people celebrating a 21st birthday party when the balcony of the flat they were on crumbled under their feet.</p> \n<p>Six students in their early 20s died after they plunged 12 metres to the pavement below and seven others were taken to hospital. The injured included Halpin, 21, and his friend Clodagh Cogley: he gripped on to her and cushioned her fall.

It was also in evidence in the national furore prompted by an article in the New York Times late on Tuesday that focused on the thousands of Irish students who travel with special J-1 visas to the US every summer. </p> \n<p>These students, said the article, were “not just a source of aspiration, but also a source of embarrassment for Ireland, marked by a series of high-profile episodes involving drunken partying and the wrecking of apartments in places like San Francisco and Santa Barbara”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8cb4460437e755baad28663ab3974c84cff6f38\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434738121780/25cd2415-9f69-4f2e-8416-d1ef557375b1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"One of the many messages left near the scene of a fourth-floor balcony collapse.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the many messages left near the scene of the balcony collapse.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Dasilva/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It quoted a 2014 column by Cahir O’Doherty, the arts and culture editor of the Irish Voice, expressing distress at “the callous destruction unleashed by these loaded Irish students” at a rented house in San Francisco. “They ripped chandeliers from the ceilings, they broke doors and they smashed windows; they even punched holes in the walls,” he wrote. “Then they abandoned the place without a heads-up or a word of apology.”</p> \n<p>The perceived implication that the celebrating students may have in some way been to blame for the balcony collapse sparked hurt and fury. The New York Times public editor, Margaret Sullivan, <a href=\"http://publiceditor.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/valid-complaints-on-story-about-berkeley-balcony-collapse/?ref=topics\">wrote on her blog</a> on Wednesday that her office had field hundreds of complaints about the piece from readers who were “quite understandably” upset. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/17/irish-student-deaths-minister-hits-out-at-new-york-times-coverage\">Berkeley Irish student deaths: minister hits out at New York Times coverage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Indulging in the stereotype of drunken, feckless Irish students caused huge offence. And it could not be further from the selfless actions of Halpin, which have been credited by the 21-year-old Cogley’s family as having possibly saved her life. They said: “Both of them sadly came off as badly as each other. Jack tried to grab Clodagh and helped lessen the impact of her fall. They both fell at the same time.”</p> \n<p>In the US, the focus of the inquiry into the tragedy is now on rain damage and dry rot that allegedly weakened the supports on the balcony where the Irish students were standing. Anger in the victims’ home country was compounded when it emerged that the company that built the apartment in Berkeley was accused two years ago of building faulty balconies in another building, as court documents showed.</p> \n<p>The California-based Segue Construction paid $3.4m to settle litigation over alleged defects in a condominium development in Millbrae, California, after a homeowners’ association sued, the residents’ lawyer confirmed to the US media.</p> \n<p>Cogley, the granddaughter of an Irish rugby commentator, is now listening to Harry Potter tapes while recovering from her injuries.

He said Japan would respond sincerely to “scientifically backed comments” in the report but criticised it as lacking consensus.</p> \n<p>Reflecting the sharp divide among the nearly 90 member nations of the international body, the report laid out both sides of the argument.</p> \n<p>Under Tokyo’s revised proposal for the upcoming whaling season it plans to catch 333 minke whales each year between 2015 and 2027, about one-third of what it has previously targeted. </p> \n<p>Japan’s actual catch has fallen in recent years in part because of declining domestic demand for whale meat. Protests by the anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd also contributed to the lower catch. </p> \n<p>The Japanese government has spent large amounts of tax money to sustain whaling operations.</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/999bd88fe5e4ba8b6999c745802282b8c4707650/0_0_2900_1739/2900.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1739,"width":2900,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"HO/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"A whale (front) and another (partly seen at right) being dragged on board a Japanese ship after being harpooned in Antarctic waters.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T05:12:01Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T05:12:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":27,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Whaling","Japan","Conservation","Whales","Marine life","Animals","Asia Pacific","Wildlife","World news","Cetaceans","Environment"],"tags":[{"id":"environment/whaling","webTitle":"Whaling"},{"id":"world/japan","webTitle":"Japan"},{"id":"environment/conservation","webTitle":"Conservation"},{"id":"environment/whales","webTitle":"Whales"},{"id":"environment/marine-life","webTitle":"Marine life"},{"id":"world/animals","webTitle":"Animals"},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"environment/cetaceans","webTitle":"Cetaceans"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"}],"section":{"id":"environment"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"environment"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/20/japan-plans-unilateral-restart-to-antarctic-whaling-in-2015-says-official","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4axta","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/environment/2015/jun/20/japan-plans-unilateral-restart-to-antarctic-whaling-in-2015-says-official","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/20/japan-plans-unilateral-restart-to-antarctic-whaling-in-2015-says-official"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/999bd88fe5e4ba8b6999c745802282b8c4707650/0_0_2900_1739/2900.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1739,"width":2900,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A whale (front) and another (partly seen at right) being dragged on board a Japanese ship after being harpooned in Antarctic waters.

In Finland, the rightwing populist Finns party entered a coalition government in April.</p> \n<p>In a speech on Thursday night, Dahl listed four priorities for the DPP: cutting the number of asylum seekers; reintroducing border controls; reforming the EU, with Britain as a close ally, to prevent migrants claiming benefits; and raising welfare spending on sick and elderly people.</p> \n<p>In 2011, Denmark angered the European commission, which monitors compliance with EU treaties, when its centre-right coalition – under pressure from the DPP – <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/d190a6d0-b156-11e0-9444-00144feab49a.html\">reintroduced customs checks</a> at its borders with Sweden and Germany in apparent breach of the 1995 Schengen agreement. </p> \n<p>In a measure of the DPP’s influence in Danish politics, Liberal leaders have described refugees as a threat to the cohesion of Danish society. On Thursday night, senior Liberals said they would welcome the DPP into government. </p> \n<p>However, the DPP and Liberals disagree in a number of areas such as health, policing and unemployment benefits. The DPP wants to increase public spending by DKr4bn (&pound;380m) a year, while the Liberals have promised tax cuts.</p> \n<p>“The coming days will show if there is basis for forming a foundation which can govern,” Rasmussen said late on Thursday night. “There are many considerations to be taken.”</p> \n<p>Whatever happens, Denmark’s new government will be strongly Eurosceptic: all the rightwing parties share criticisms of the EU, although none wants to leave the union. Danish media have talked of the “capitulation” of the Liberals to the DPP on Europe after the four parties of the rightwing bloc last week announced their joint support for David Cameron’s plan to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s EU membership.<br /></p> \n<p>After a cliffhanger election that was seen as too close to call on polling day, the rightwing bloc secured the slimmest of majorities in parliament, with 90 seats to the left’s 89. The results include votes from the autonomous Danish nations of Greenland and the Faroe Islands, which each have two seats.</p> \n<p>Thorning-Schmidt said in her resignation speech: “Leadership also consists of stepping back at the right moment, and that time is now.” Her Social Democrats had fought back from a yawning deficit in the polls, but the party’s attempts to appear tough on immigration backfired. </p> \n<p>Sweden’s Social Democrats have been sharply critical of their Danish sister party’s stance on immigration. The shift to the right in Denmark leaves Sweden as the only country in Scandinavia – traditionally a stronghold of social democracy – in which the centre-left holds power. In sharp contrast to Denmark, Swedish mainstream parties have treated the anti-immigrant Sweden Democrats as pariahs, though this has not prevented the far right from polling as high as 18%.<br /></p> \n<p>During a calamitous night for the Danish left, a sliver of comfort came in the form of the new Alternative party, formed two years ago to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/16/denmarks-green-alternative-organic-meat-free-and-poised-for-breakthrough\">champion a green agenda</a>, which won nine seats with almost 5% of the vote.</p> \n<p>Turnout on Thursday was almost 86%, in keeping with a trend of high voter participation in Denmark. </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434708365882/6e74458b-6ce7-4456-8caa-0f15ca23241a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Joachim Ladefoged/AP","altText":"Kristian Thulesen Dahl","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Joachim Ladefoged/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T10:15:08Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T13:47:26Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":504,"contributors":[{"name":"David Crouch","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/david-crouch"},{"name":"Lars Eriksen","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/larseriksen"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Denmark","Europe","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/denmark","webTitle":"Denmark"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-457217129","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":99,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/19/150619Denmark.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/19/150619Denmark_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/6/19/1434715099134/KP_300734_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Denmark elections: Lars Lokke Rasmussen wins slender victory for conservative blue bloc - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Denmark elections: Lars Lokke Rasmussen wins slender victory for conservative blue bloc - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Denmark elections: Lars Lokke Rasmussen wins slender victory for conservative blue bloc - video"}}],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/danish-peoples-party-dahl-border-controls-election","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avz8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/19/danish-peoples-party-dahl-border-controls-election","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/danish-peoples-party-dahl-border-controls-election"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2eda579d7422eb81bbed7ee365224c6223e277bd/0_1235_2877_1726/2877.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1726,"width":2877,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Head of the Danish People’s Party Kristian Thulesen Dahl sings the song :”You’ll Never Walk Alone” during his party’s celebrations Thursday evening.
