Communications minister Marianela Paco said Morales had thought the “pope of the poor” would appreciate the gesture. </p> \n<p>“That was the intention of this gift, and it was not any sort of maneuver ... It was really from great affection” she told the Patria Nueva radio station.<br /></p> \n<p>But Rev James Bretzke, a theologian at Boston College in Massachusetts, accused Morales of attempting to manipulate the pope.</p> \n<p>“Does this seem to be using the crucifix for political agenda?

I stopped here to greet you and above all to remember. To remember a brother, our brother, a victim of interests who did not want him to fight for the freedom of Bolivia,” the pope said on the scheduled stop.<br /></p> \n<p>He also reportedly received a medal, bearing a hammer and sickle, from Morales that was issued in memory of Espinal’s death.<br /></p> \n<p>Lombardi said he personally wasn’t offended by Morales’ gift. “You can dispute the significance and use of the symbol now, but the origin is from Espinal and the sense of it was about an open dialogue, not about a specific ideology,” Lombardi said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/08/pope-francis-south-america-argentina-dirty-war-dictatorship\">Pope's South American tour recalls a divided church – and a dirty war</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Argentinian pope has been criticised in some quarters for not doing more to protect leftwing priests during the military dictatorship in his homeland.

I can’t attest to their surrogates.”</p> \n<p>Clinton said he hoped the campaigns would focus on policy, not rhetoric and grandstanding. “We ought to be as specific and clear as we can about the policy choices before us … [so] we know what the heck we’re deciding on,” he said. “That’s all I really care about – besides I know who I’d like to win.”</p> \n<p>Still, the Hillary Clinton campaign took a jab at Jeb Bush, posting on Twitter: “Anyone who believes Americans aren’t working hard enough hasn’t met enough American workers”. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"hillary\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Anyone who believes Americans aren't working hard enough hasn't met enough American workers. &lt;a href=&quot;http://t.co/wyS1p8zcDo&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wyS1p8zcDo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) \n &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton/status/618987543674142720&quot;&gt;July 9, 2015&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Bush responded on his Twitter feed: “Anyone who discounts 6.5 million people stuck in part-time work &amp; seeking full-time jobs hasnt [sic] listened to working Americans @hillaryclinton”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"jeb\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Anyone who discounts 6.5 million people stuck in part-time work &amp;amp; seeking full-time jobs hasnt listened to working Americans &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/HillaryClinton&quot;&gt;@hillaryclinton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeb Bush (@JebBush) \n &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/JebBush/status/619085156830314496&quot;&gt;July 9, 2015&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The tone between the two former presidents was rather more congenial as they discussed their leadership strategies and the current, attritional, state of US politics.</p> \n<p>“I think the American people expect some sharp elbows in a campaign. I think what really discourages them post-campaign is an inability to govern in a way that is congenial and hopefully that will change,” Bush said. “It’s important to create an environment of cordiality.”</p> \n<p>He said that he repeatedly tried to bond with Russian president Vladimir Putin. “I had 26 meetings with Putin one-on-one, more or less, and every one of them started with ‘how’s your family?’” said Bush. “I started off, ‘how’s your daughters doing?’, no matter how difficult the subject would be. The purpose was to try and create a human bridge, a connection, and then we’d get to the issues at hand.”</p> \n<p>Clinton said that when negotiating with world leaders he tried to frame the argument to make it seem like their interests were aligned with America’s. Also on the theme of conciliation and co-operation, he said he “almost cried” when he saw a picture of the South Carolina legislature committing to remove the Confederate flag from the Capitol grounds.</p> \n<p>Bush talked about the need to avoid the trappings of power and create an environment around leadership where “sycophants are not allowed in,” adding Clinton told him to use big words. </p> \n<p>Clinton replied that he did not know any big words, except perhaps “itinerant portrait artist”, apparently referring to Bush’s hobby of painting portraits since retirement. <br /></p> \n<p>The moderated discussion came at an awkward time for Bush after it was revealed that the commander-in-chief who led the US into wars in Iraq and Afghanistan charged a military veterans’ charity $100,000 <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jul/09/george-w-bush-veterans-charity-100000\">to speak at a fundraiser in 2012</a>.</p> \n<p>ABC News reported that he was also provided with a private jet to travel to Houston for the event, at a cost of $20,000, while his wife, Laura, was paid $50,000 to speak at the previous year’s gala. </p> \n<p>On Thursday evening, <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/firm-accused-ponzi-scheme-allegedly-paid-george-bush/story?id=32337352\">ABC News reported</a> that an energy company in California described as a “Ponzi-like scheme” by federal prosecutors in a civil fraud case allegedly misused funds to pay Bush $200,000 for a speech in 2012.</p> \n<p>Bill Clinton’s highly lucrative speaking engagements have also come under scrutiny amid his wife’s White House ambitions.</p> \n<p>Bush did not address the controversy in Dallas, but told the audience of scholars that he was relaxed about being the frequent target of criticism. “I try not to worry about it,” he said. “You’ve got to be confident in what you believe in.”</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/eeb7802db14ccb6c53306a903c77b67727fef2b5/0_74_2509_1506/2509.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1506,"width":2509,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mike Stone/Reuters","altText":"Former U.S. Presidents George W.

So why is he espousing pro-Putin views in Ukraine?</p>","byline":"Shaun Walker in Donetsk","body":"<p>In an office just off Lenin Square in Donetsk, a small group of journalists is plotting the launch of a new television channel, to be based in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic. </p> \n<p>In the polarised media climate around the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/30/ukraine-ceasefire-there-is-shooting-all-the-time\">conflict in east Ukraine</a>, it is no surprise that a new channel is being set up in the Russia-backed statelet. More surprising is the journalist leading it: Andrei Babitsky, who for years was accused by many in Russia of being a traitor to his country. </p> \n<p>Babitsky was drawn to Donetsk, he said, because he feels a deep sense of injustice about how the conflict in east Ukraine has been covered in the west. He was fired last year by his long-standing employer, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, he claims because of his reporting on Ukraine.</p> \n<p>“I think the situation has changed a lot since the conflict sprung up between Russia and the west. And to a significant extent, Radio Liberty, which for a long time was a journalistic organisation, has become a propaganda instrument,” Babitsky claimed in an interview in Donetsk recently.<br /></p> \n<p>Babitsky acquired fame for his extraordinary and fearless reporting from Chechnya during the two wars fought by Russia to regain control of the republic. His reports for Radio Liberty were seen as deeply sympathetic to the Chechen cause. In early 2000, during the first months of Vladimir Putin’s presidency, Babitsky was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2000/feb/13/chechnya.ameliagentleman\">kidnapped</a> by Russian forces and disappeared for many weeks. When he was finally released, he left Russia.<br /></p> \n<p>“My face was too recognisable, my reputation was difficult, it became impossible to work as a journalist in Russia,” he said. He settled in Prague, where he continued to work for RFE/RL. In 2005 he returned to Chechnya to interview insurgency leader Shamil Basayev, who was in hiding in the mountains and had claimed responsibility for terrorist attacks including the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2004/sep/05/russia.chechnya\">Beslan school siege</a>. Russian authorities were furious and banned the channel from operating in the country.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"be98db081577edae709bc27d50ca6461c85606ed\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/be98db081577edae709bc27d50ca6461c85606ed/158_32_2280_2153/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andrei Babitsky\" width=\"1000\" height=\"944\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrei Babitsky </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Kubani/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“After the Basayev interview, every time I entered Russia for two or three years there were problems: questioning, detentions. Once I even remember a whole group of them were there at the plane doors, and dragged me straight off to the prosecutor’s office. But by about 2011, interest had already waned and I went back and forward with no problems.”</p> \n<p>Babitsky continued working for RFE/RL, the network of radio stations and news websites funded by the US government which broadcasts across eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Babitsky had worked for the station since before the collapse of the USSR, and after he left Russia he began to work first on the South Caucasus and more recently on Ukraine. </p> \n<p>He said he caused controversy with an article he wrote last year in which he supported Putin’s annexation of Crimea (or “Putin’s decision to support the population of Crimea” as he called it). Then there was more trouble with his reports from east Ukraine.</p> \n<p>“I had filmed a piece about the exhumation of bodies of people shot by the Aidar [pro-Ukraine volunteer] battalion, and they cut it heavily and created a huge scandal. The Ukrainian service said that with my views I should not be sent to Donbass.”</p> \n<p>In September 2014, he was fired. The official reason was due to staff reorganisation, but he is convinced the unofficial reason for dismissal, after more than two decades of working for the network, was his position on Ukraine events.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for RFE/RL, Martins Zvaners, said while the organisation could not discuss the specifics of Babitsky’s case it was “totally false” to say he had been fired for his personal views. Zvaners also denied there was any bias in the organisation’s coverage of Ukraine.</p> \n<p>“RFE/RL’s credibility as a journalistic organisation is too important for us to skew our coverage of any topic in a direction that cannot be verified by facts on the ground,” Zvaners told the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Two editorial employees of Radio Liberty said they did not believe there was a skewed editorial line on Ukraine, but another said there may be a difference between the English language service and those in local languages.</p> \n<p>“There is a feeling that the Ukrainian service within Radio Liberty is really powerful and the coverage of the conflict has become quite unbalanced,” said the journalist, who asked to remain anonymous. “The way they treated Andrei was extremely unfair.”</p> \n<p>The conflict in Ukraine has resulted in vicious polemics over media coverage. Russian state channels, watched by many in east Ukraine, have focused hours of coverage on the conflict and have been accused of fabricating stories and whipping up hatred. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5151c44a4a0d0fcefc7dc7d42eafdf1fc1424707\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436459580910/d6df5eab-590c-4ac7-93a3-e0dadb41c1e6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Protest in Moscow in 2000 to demand the release kidnapped journalisst Andrei Babitsky.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protest in Moscow in 2000 to demand the release kidnapped journalisst Andrei Babitsky.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuri Kadobnov/AFP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the separatist-held areas, journalist Pavel Kanygin from independent Russian paper Novaya Gazeta was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/greenslade/2015/jun/18/russian-journalist-beaten-and-detained-by-ukrainian-separatists\">detained and assaulted by security forces</a> when in the republic last month. The BBC’s Natalia Antelava was told she would not be given accreditation to work in the republic after accusing separatists and Russian television of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32137302\">inventing</a> the death of a ten-year-old girl.</p> \n<p>A number of commentators have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/2015/apr/09/kremlin-hall-of-mirrors-military-information-psychology\">accused</a> the Kremlin of fighting an “information war”, using fake stories and doctored photographs to skew events.</p> \n<p>Babitsky, however, said western media coverage of the conflict has been unfair, focusing on Russian aggression and ignoring the local context. He described his new project as an “independent internal channel which will fill a new niche”. It will be called Dialogue and the idea is to hold discussions between Donetsk and the rest of Ukraine.<br /></p> \n<p>“We want to move away from the language of hate, to use more analysis, and to try to bring in voices from the other side of the lines,” said Babitsky. He insisted the channel was not affiliated with state structures in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People’s Republic, and said the modest funding had come from local businessmen. He plans to hire around six people to get the channel up and running within a month.</p> \n<p>“Humans should remain human in any circumstances, and that is difficult to achieve in times of war. Hatred towards the enemy twists human feelings and we need to hear calm voices.”</p> \n<p>The new channel, said Babitsky, would have no red lines when it came to discussing the political solution to the crisis, though he was evasive when asked if it would be able to criticise separatist authorities freely. <br /></p> \n<p>As for his own journey, Babitsky said there is nothing surprising about someone who was once considered a traitor by many Russians now espousing pro-Kremlin views.</p> \n<p>“At that time I felt for the Chechens, because I thought that if these people want to live by their own traditions and move away from Russia then they should be able to. Probably we should have listened to those moods and not killed so many people,” he said. </p> \n<p>“It’s the same here. I think Russia is playing a significant role here, but the reasons are not to be found in Russia, they are internal. This is a civil war, where the interests of two parts of Ukraine that consider themselves linked to two cultural traditions are clashing with each other.”<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436458029114/59336509-85f6-4cf5-bf63-d9e4fdd0c97a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Maxim Shemetov/Reuters","altText":"Celebrations for the first anniversary of the Crimean treaty signing in Sevastopol, March 18, 2015.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Maxim Shemetov/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/be98db081577edae709bc27d50ca6461c85606ed/158_32_2280_2153/2280.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2153,"width":2280,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andrei Babitsky  Photograph: Samuel Kubani/AFP/Getty Images","credit":"Samuel Kubani/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Andrei Babitsky","cleanCaption":"Andrei Babitsky ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Samuel Kubani/AFP/Getty Images"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436459581574/d6df5eab-590c-4ac7-93a3-e0dadb41c1e6-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Protest in Moscow in 2000 to demand the release kidnapped journalisst Andrei Babitsky.

There are good things, but there are difficult things that still need to be worked on.”</p> \n<p>His Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, broadcast a similar message of determination to stay at the negotiating table. “We’re working hard, but not rushed, to get the job done. Mark my words; you can’t change horses in the middle of a stream,” the foreign minister tweeted.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/JZarif/statuses/619189199447703552\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">We're working hard, but not rushed, to get the job done.

Lavrov said he expected to return to the talks late on Thursday or early Friday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/09/iran-nuclear-negotiations-extended-john-kerry\">Iran negotiations extended but John Kerry insists talks are 'not open-ended'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The UK foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, and the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, are also in Vienna and expected to stay for late-night talks on Thursday. <br /></p> \n<p>The arms embargo row came to a head on Tuesday when the EU foreign policy chief, Frederica Mogherini, reportedly threatened to return to Brussels if there was not greater flexibility from the Iranians. Her Iranian counterpart Zarif is said to have replied: “Go if you wish. But do not threaten an Iranian.” Lavrov chimed in: “Do not threaten a Russian either.”</p> \n<p>At another point in the talks, Zarif said he could take his interlocutors to international court for the west’s support of Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.</p> \n<p>Diplomats said the row was soothed relatively quickly. Zarif invited Mogherini to a Persian meal on Wednesday evening.</p> \n<p>“Nobody is leaving the room with any hard feelings,” the senior Iranian official said.<br /></p> \n<p>However, the air conditioning in the hotel where the talks are being held suffered a breakdown, ratcheting up the tension and discomfort of marathon negotiating sessions. </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b5d7e20f86de246e10af6c48704647929d2fd801/0_128_3500_2100/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2100,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Carlos Barria/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Carlos Barria/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T22:14:45Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T22:36:10Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":119,"contributors":[{"name":"Julian Borger","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741281/JulianBorger.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/julianborger"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Iran","Iran's nuclear programme","US news","World news","US foreign policy","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran"},{"id":"world/irans-nuclear-programme","webTitle":"Iran's nuclear programme"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"us-news/us-foreign-policy","webTitle":"US foreign policy"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Julian Borger","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/julianborger"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/09/iran-hits-out-western-negotiators-nuclear-talks","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agpb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jul/09/iran-hits-out-western-negotiators-nuclear-talks","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/09/iran-hits-out-western-negotiators-nuclear-talks"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b5d7e20f86de246e10af6c48704647929d2fd801/0_128_3500_2100/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2100,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif talks to journalists from a balcony of the Palais Coburg hotel where the Iran nuclear talks meetings are being held in Vienna.
