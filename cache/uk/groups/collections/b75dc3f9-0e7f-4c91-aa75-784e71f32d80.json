The stage is now set for data to be collected from collisions within the LHC’s giant detectors.</p> \n<p>The &pound;3.74bn LHC, the most powerful atom-smasher ever built, was restarted in April after a two-year upgrade.</p> \n<p>Two beams of particles travelling just below the speed of light were sent flying in opposite directions through 16.7 miles (27km) of circular underground tunnels straddling the Swiss-French border.</p> \n<p>The beam energy has only now been ramped up to its operating level of 13TeV, almost twice the power used to uncover the Higgs boson two years ago. The LHC detected the elementary particle that gives other particles mass after scientists had spent 50 years looking for it.</p> \n<p>With the ability to tap into higher energy the scientists hope to explore mysterious realms of “new physics” that could yield evidence of hidden extra dimensions and dark matter.</p> \n<p>Dark matter is the invisible, undetectable 84% of material making up the universe and binding galaxies together. Its nature is unknown.</p> \n<p>Protons race around the LHC beam tunnels at three metres per second below the speed of light. The energy released when they collide is used to spark the creation of new particles.</p> \n<p>Albert Einstein showed that energy and mass are interchangeable, and upping the energy levels at the LHC increases the chances of some of it being converted to previously undetected heavier particles – possibly including dark matter.</p> \n<p>The particle collisions take place in four detectors arranged around the beam ring known as Atlas, CMS, Alice and LHCb.</p> \n<p>Atlas team leader Professor David Charlton, from the University of Birmingham, said: “We’re heading for unexplored territory. It’s going to be a new era for science.”</p> \n<p>As well as searching for dark matter LHC scientists also hope to create more and possibly different strains of Higgs boson, investigate antimatter and test the theory of “supersymmetry” that predicts every known particle has a more massive hidden partner.</p> \n<p>Supersymmetry seeks to fill gaps in the Standard Model, the all-encompassing blueprint of particles and forces in the universe that has been in place since the 1970s.</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433307359753/ba24a229-9fbd-4167-a2ee-36ecc7f7a6f1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Macdiarmid/Getty","altText":"The Large Hadron Collider is to be run at energy levels that could reveal dark matter.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-03T04:57:42Z","lastModified":"2015-06-03T04:57:48Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":79,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Large Hadron Collider","Science","Particle physics","Physics","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"science/large-hadron-collider","webTitle":"Large Hadron Collider"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"science/particlephysics","webTitle":"Particle physics"},{"id":"science/physics","webTitle":"Physics"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"science"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"science"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jun/03/large-hadron-collider-boots-back-up-with-supercharged-energy-levels","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ea5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/science/2015/jun/03/large-hadron-collider-boots-back-up-with-supercharged-energy-levels","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/03/large-hadron-collider-boots-back-up-with-supercharged-energy-levels"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433307359753/ba24a229-9fbd-4167-a2ee-36ecc7f7a6f1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Large Hadron Collider is to be run at energy levels that could reveal dark matter.

They found the two converts to Islam guilty of conspiracy to commit murder and making or possessing an explosive device. The judge in May had entered a ruling of not guilty to another charge of knowingly facilitating a terrorist activity, citing unspecified legal reasons.</p> \n<p>The couple were arrested in July 2013 after police accused them of attempting to target the 1 July Canada Day celebrations in Victoria, the capital of British Columbia. Three homemade pressure cooker bombs were placed outside the legislature before crowds gathered but undercover police officers had already ensured they were inert by using fake explosives.</p> \n<p>The two had been inspired by al-Qaida ideology but were self-radicalised, said police, who called it a domestic threat.</p> \n<p>It is not clear what maximum sentence the couple faces because the conviction won’t be entered until next week after the defence has a chance to argue that police entrapped the couple into the plot during an elaborate undercover sting operation.</p> \n<p>Prosecutor Peter Eccles, speaking outside court, denied this. “They weren’t entrapped … it was done using old-fashioned undercover police investigation technique.”</p> \n<p>Jurors watched countless hours of video evidence collected as part of a lengthy Royal Canadian Mounted Police sting that involved undercover officers with supposed terrorist connections befriending the pair.</p> \n<p>Video and audio surveillance showed the pair discussing their ambitions to engage in holy war against the western world for perceived injustices against Muslims.</p> \n<p>On the recordings played in court the pair was heard saying they believed killing women and children was acceptable so long as they were not explicitly targeted in an attack but rather died as collateral damage.</p> \n<p>At numerous points in the surveillance recordings Nuttall could be heard describing the Boston marathon bombing as inspirational but also amateurish, and that he hoped his attack would kill hundreds. Pressure cooker bombs placed at the marathon finish line in April 2013 killed three people and injured more than 260.</p> \n<p>Defence lawyers argued that undercover police officers had played a heavyhanded role in encouraging the couple to go ahead with the plot. Nuttall’s lawyer Marilyn Sandford accused the key undercover officer involved in the RCMP sting of using the threat of disappointing Allah to frighten her client into hatching a viable plot for jihad.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433300690068/4ffa985b-f2d7-46e0-a805-effbd1e47051-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Royal Canadian Mounted Police","altText":"John Nuttall and Amanda Korody","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Royal Canadian Mounted Police"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-03T03:14:55Z","lastModified":"2015-06-03T03:14:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Canada","Americas","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/canada","webTitle":"Canada"},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/03/john-nuttall-and-amanda-korody-found-guilty-over-canada-day-bomb-plot","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49e9e","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/03/john-nuttall-and-amanda-korody-found-guilty-over-canada-day-bomb-plot","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/03/john-nuttall-and-amanda-korody-found-guilty-over-canada-day-bomb-plot"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433300690068/4ffa985b-f2d7-46e0-a805-effbd1e47051-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"John Nuttall and Amanda Korody planted bombs that undercover police had rendered harmless.

usually a place for a contemplative soak in mineral-rich waters – has been closed indefinitely following complaints that groups of bathers were regularly using it for orgies, footage of which has been posted online.</p> \n<p>The hot spring, or onsen, tourism association in Shiobara, Tochigi prefecture, near Tokyo, said it had closed Fudo no Yu, an outdoor bath that was popular for its mixed bathing and panoramic views.</p> \n<p>What the outdoor onsen lacks in size – the circular bath is just three metres (nine feet) in diameter – it makes up for in atmosphere.</p> \n<p>Only about 10 people can bathe comfortably at any one time, but it draws large numbers of visitors hoping to relax in its mountain forest setting.</p> \n<p>However, the bath’s secluded location encouraged exhibitionists, who took advantage of the absence of a caretaker and its policy of collecting a modest 200 yen admission fee through an honesty box, according to Japanese media reports.</p> \n<p>Local residents and other bathers had been complaining about witnessing lewd acts for about a year, but the last straw appeared to have been a succession of weekend orgies involving as many as 15 middle-aged men and several younger women, according to the <a href=\"http://www.tokyoreporter.com/2015/06/02/bathers-steamy-filming-leads-to-closing-of-tochigi-onsen/\">Tokyo Reporter website</a>.</p> \n<p>The bath, part of the popular Shiobara onsen resort, is also thought to have been targeted by voyeurs armed with cameras, the site said, citing a report in the Mainichi Shimbun.</p> \n<p>Shigeki Tashiro, the head of the local council, said action had to be taken to safeguard Fudo no Yu’s reputation as one of Japan’s finest onsen.</p> \n<p>“With the resort being promoted by the prefecture as a tourist attraction, it was a tough decision,” Tashiro was quoted as saying. “However, if left as it is, the image of the area as a tourist destination could be downgraded.”</p> \n<p>Onsen are an important part of the tourism economy in Japan, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/07/geothermal-power-stations-japan]\">whose vast reservoirs of geothermal activity</a> support more than 3,000 hot springs.</p> \n<p>Fudo no Yu’s popularity as a location for al fresco sex has embarrassed local tourist authorities, which had featured it on their website and promotional posters.</p> \n<p>“We are sorry, but it was breach of manners that was impossible to overlook,” an unnamed member of the local residents’ association told the Asahi Shimbun. “We had no choice but to close the bath.”</p> \n<p>The offending onsen, which has now been drained of its water, has existed since the Meiji era (1868-1912), media reports said.<br

Our correspondent Helena Smith reports: Well-placed sources are not ruling out a third teleconference between the Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras and the German and French leaders after tonight’s meeting at 8pm in Brussels with European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker. The radical left leader will be accompanied by the Oxford-educated economist Euclid Tsakalotos, who heads Greece’s negotiating team, his close ally, minister of state Nikos Pappas and the Greek government spokesman Gavriel Sekallarides. Two texts are still believed to “be doing the rounds” according to officials: the 47-page Greek proposal, and the agreement drafted by officials representing the debt-stricken country’s creditors at the EU, ECB and IMF late last night.

this is an undisputed fact,” the Chengdu Daily said in an editorial. “Taking this to heart, we should be less blind and keep a cool head while kissing the cheeks of the chubby blue guy.”</p> \n<p>In South Korea, where a ban on Japanese popular culture has been lifted in increments since the late 1990s, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2010/aug/18/japan-south-korea-disputed-islands\">disputes over territory </a> and the legacy of the second world war show little sign of easing.</p> \n<p>A recent survey showed that mutual suspicion among the public remains high: 52% of Japanese polled said they had a negative view of South Koreans, while in South Korea, 73% said they felt similarly towards the Japanese.</p> \n<p>Doraemon’s global popularity is such that in 2008 <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2008/mar/20/japan\">he was made an ambassador</a> to promote Japanese popular culture overseas.</p> \n<p>Having built a huge following in Japan since his comic book debut in 1969, he has become instantly recognisable throughout East Asia and, more recently, in the US.</p> \n<p>The manga, created by Fujiko F Fujio, has sold well over 100m copies, making it one of the best-selling comics in the world, while the TV series has won over audiences in more than 30 countries.</p> \n<p>Last summer, Doraemon made its US debut on the Disney XD satellite channel.
