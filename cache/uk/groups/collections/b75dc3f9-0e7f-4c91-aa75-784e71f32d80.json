The reason was the decision by the mayor, Oleg Zontov, to move for a vote over the application of a law that had only just been passed by the Ukrainian president, Petro Poroshenko. This “law on the condemnation of communist and Nazi totalitarian regimes”, voted through by parliament on 9 April, prohibits all defence of Nazism and communism.</p> \n<p>The sale of communist souvenirs, and even the singing of the Internationale, is now banned in Ukraine. Individual offenders risk up to five years in prison. Members of organisations risk up to 10. The legislators were seemingly not worried about the risk of deepening the cultural abyss between western Ukraine and the Russophone east of the country, a centre of Soviet industrialisation between 1930 and 1950, and a place where nostalgia is ever present.</p> \n<p>In Sloviansk, the mayor belongs to the Poroshenko bloc and he decided to apply the new law in his own way, targeting the statue of Lenin that enjoys pride of place opposite city hall. The national law has not yet taken effect, but debates are already under way over changing communist-era names of Ukrainian cities. Dnipropetrovsk, for instance, (named after the celebrated revolutionary Grigory Petrovsky) could be quickly retitled.</p> \n<p>At the Sloviansk council meeting of 29 April, a vote on the “dismantling of the monument to Lenin, situated in October Revolution Square” was added to the order of business. But “the meeting was suspended and the vote postponed,” explained Edouard Torskiy, a journalist with <em>Delovoy Slavyansk</em>, when “militant communists barged in on the meeting, threatening a return of separatist forces if the councillors targeted Soviet symbols”.</p> \n<p>Last year this city was seized by pro-Russian separatists led by Igor Girkin, a former Russian army officer who also goes by the name of Strelkov (Shooter). For a time it became the epicentre of the fighting between pro-Russia rebels and pro-Kiev forces. Strelkov briefly became minister of defence for the self-proclaimed Republic of Donetsk, taking numerous hostages, including journalists and observers from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. The city changed hands again in June 2014 after fierce bombardment. But tensions are still high, in both the city and among its politicians, because the pro-Kiev mayor is in a minority on the council.</p> \n<p>The elected officials are more or less the same as before. The majority belong to the Party of the Regions, the organisation headed by former Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, who fled the country after the Maidan revolution, and the Communist party. The next local elections will take place in October.</p> \n<p>Towards the end of last April, the giant Lenin statue had already been vandalised, covered in pink paint and adorned with a Ukrainian flag as a scarf. Around its base, placards explained “how to spot a separatist”, offering tips on recognising signs of separatism in one’s neighbours.</p> \n<p>To begin with, local nationalists appeared to leave it to the councillors to decide the fate of the statue – though since the beginning of the war, and well before the “de-communisation” law was passed, more than 100 statues of Lenin have been demolished, many in the middle of the night.</p> \n<p>On 27 May a new council meeting was scheduled and Zontov placed the statue on the order of business again. All of Sloviansk’s nationalist groups attended to express support for its removal, with nationalist parties Svoboda and Right Sector turning out en masse. The number of nationalist militants has boomed since the war began, even though the number of MPs from these two groups only went up to seven out of 450 at the general election last October. In Sloviansk the nationalists have long been frustrated at their lack of representation on the council.</p> \n<p>At the meeting the nationalists’ constant interruptions led to a scuffle before the issue of the statue had even been broached. However, after temporarily halting proceedings, the mayor was able to start the debate. “I am responsible for the political life of our city,” he said. “There are many different points of view in our council. To find compromises, we have to talk with each other and take a decision today.”</p> \n<p>Zontov proposed that, rather than being destroyed, the statue should be sold at auction or placed in a museum. As he spoke, nationalists in combat dress took position close to the council members. Then a man shouted from the public area: “I have in my hand a letter signed by 4,000 residents. People are against the destruction of the statue because it’s part of their history, part of their youth. You should listen to the opinions of your fellow citizens.”</p> \n<p>The ensuing row deepened the divide between the younger generation, which looks towards Europe, and their often nostalgic elders, who lived under the USSR. The self-declared “patriots” shouted: “Shame on you! Glory to Ukraine. Glory to our heroes!” Then a young nationalist militant told the assembly: “It was Lenin who began the process of destruction of Ukraine. He brought the famine to Ukraine from 1922, then he launched a violent collectivisation. He created an ideology that killed millions of people.”</p> \n<p>Another young man berated the councillors: “You are ‘provocateurs’. We are the descendants of people assassinated by that man. We are going to make that statue disappear. Now you are going to decide whether it’s destroyed or whether it’s removed. That is the choice we give you.”</p> \n<p>The uproar resumed with loud shouts of “separatists” filling the hall, followed by cries of “Shame on you”. Zontov brought the meeting to an early close, but shouted above the clamour: “We have six months to resolve this question. Come to the next meeting.”</p> \n<p>In the hall afterwards, militants flourished a placard calling for “Sloviansk without Lenin.” Tamara, an opposition member, left the assembly assailed by insults from the young nationalist militants, but didn’t seem too bothered. “Our mayor doesn’t do anything for this city. He only offers suggestions for destruction,” she said. “He has found 50 people to support his plan. We have collected 4,500 signatures against the destruction of the statue. Even if Lenin wasn’t a good human being, he was part of our history and you don’t wipe out history like that.”</p> \n<p>But in the end the debate was settled by the minority. In the early hours of 3&nbsp;June, militants from Right Sector tore the statue down.</p> \n<p><em>This article first appeared in the French newspaper Lib&eacute;ration</em></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434751667718/Ukrainian-nationalists-po-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ukrainian nationalists pose before the statue of Lenin in Sloviansk before tearing it down earlier this month.

Now the shadow of collapse has lifted - but the young and jobless are still struggling","byline":"Alistair Dawber in Madrid","body":"<p>Daniel Roman is feeling upbeat. Six months ago, the 38-year-old sommelier opened a small wine shop in the Mercado de la Cebada, a covered market in Madrid’s trendy La Latina neighbourhood. “I’m confident,” he says, as he serves two elderly customers from the counter. “Opening here was the natural next step for me. I’ve always wanted to build something of my own.”</p> \n<p>The statistics would indicate he has every reason to feel cheerful. Spain’s economy appears to be emerging at full throttle from one of the longest and deepest recessions it has ever suffered. An IMF report said growth by the end of this year will be a startling 3.1%, leading to job creation, and, in theory at least, a better standard of living for Spaniards who have suffered crippling levels of unemployment and decline over the last seven years.</p> \n<p>But like many Spaniards, Roman’s optimism does not stem from a faith that Spain’s economic woes are necessarily over. His working day starts at 9am and he gets home after midnight, dividing his time into four shifts between the shop and the restaurant he still works in.</p> \n<p>“For me, I’m in a good place. I’m breaking even in the shop and that’s pretty good,” he says. “But the economy has become a psychological problem. People have been in trouble for so long that they cannot find reasons to be confident. Everyone is told that the economy is improving, but they don’t necessarily believe it.”</p> \n<p>Crushing losses in recent local elections for prime minister Mariano Rajoy’s governing People’s party (PP), which has hailed the economic recovery in its pitch to voters, suggest that feeling is widespread. A double-dip recession that sent thousands of businesses to the wall, sapped lending and left millions out of work has left scars so deep that for many people in Spain the turnaround is far from complete.</p> \n<p>While the big picture is undoubtedly improving – big investors are returning to a country that barely three years ago was widely expected to need a Greece-style sovereign bailout – Spain is still mired in a period of transition.</p> \n<p>Even the IMF report that welcomed Spain’s impressive growth rate – one of the strongest in Europe – also stressed the shaky jobs outlook, noting that unemployment was “still painfully high” and that “vulnerabilities remain”.</p> \n<p>“Spain has returned to about 95% of where it was in 2008,” says Professor Javier Diaz-Gim&eacute;nez of the IESE business school in Madrid. “That means 2008 is still a benchmark people look back at with nostalgia. At current growth rates, the economy will get back to where it was in 2008 at the end of next year. It’s a very late recovery.”</p> \n<p>One of the biggest worries for those yet to see any improvements in their lives is whether even a sustained recovery will be enough to repair the damage. Jobs are starting to return, currently at a rate of 400,000-500,000 a year, but more than three million were lost during the downturn, so the new jobs represent only a small improvement in an unemployment rate, which is still runningat almost 24%. In Greece, which now finds itself on the edge of the economic precipice, the rate is 26%. Inequalities, meanwhile, are deepening, leaving some to wonder whether the crisis is even over at all.</p> \n<p>“The economy is certainly not improving for those without a job or a home,” says Lotta Tenhunen, a social activist in Vallecas, a less-wealthy district of Madrid. The group she works with, PAH, campaigns on behalf of those evicted after falling into arrears on their mortgage payments, and became especially prominent at the height of the recession. In Vallecas, it still meets every week: “People and families are still being driven out of their homes – and the rate is still rising.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f36c660c46b29df99f485dd15066c05498849302\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434800390676/80dfe28e-b5e1-4cf6-a2b4-37ed29e4f7ac-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Daniel Roman his wine shop in the Mercado de la Cebada.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Roman in his wine shop in the Mercado de la Cebada. ‘I’m breaking even and that’s pretty good.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alistair Dawber</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Prospects for the young are particularly bleak. About half of under-25-year-olds in the labour force are without a job, and this threatens to leave the country with a listless lost generation for whom unemployment is the norm. The ranks of the long-term jobless are also swelling.</p> \n<p>“It is not just the headline unemployment figure that is worrying; it is also the type of unemployment,” says Antonio Barroso of consultancy Teneo Intelligence. “Forty per cent of unemployed people are over the age of 45, so difficult to retrain and bring back into the labour market. You also have to look at the types of jobs being created. Most new positions are temporary contracts, where people are left in a precarious position with very few rights – this does not breed confidence.”</p> \n<p>For self-starters such as Roman, government attempts to cut red tape for new businesses have been one encouraging change. Thousands of Spaniards have been setting up on their own, adding to the growing numbers of the self-employed as they pin their hopes on a recovery in consumption. Near Roman’s shop, gourmet bakeries and swanky bars are popping up, just beginning to replace the boarded-up outlets that plagued the neighbourhood in the downturn.</p> \n<p>Finding the means to get going as an entrepreneur is still a challenge, however, in an era of constrained bank lending. For those unable to start a business, it is still not clear where a major job recovery touted by the centre-right PP is going to come from.</p> \n<p>A tourism boom is helping as retailers and hotels take on seasonal staff, and some industrial sectors, including car manufacturing, are on the up. But going back to the growth model of the past is not an option. Spain’s economy – built for years on cheap debt and a housebuilding bubble – imploded amid the credit crisis of 2008. Its banks, to that point happy to lend to all comers, later required a €40bn bailout from Brussels.</p> \n<p>Several favourable tailwinds are now helping a turnaround: the weak euro has helped exporters find new foreign markets to compensate for a lack of domestic interest; a weak oil price is keeping business costs down; and pan-eurozone policies designed to reflate the economy, such as the ECB’s quantitative easing programme, have helped to stimulate demand. War in the Middle East helps the holiday industry, but the benefits are not trickling down fast enough to ordinary Spaniards. Small business owners treat any suggestion that the crisis is over with scepticism.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Looking back, 2006 and 2007 seem like a mirage in the desert</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Victoria Bazaga, hotelier</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“Looking back, 2006 and 2007 seem like a mirage in the desert,” says Victoria Bazaga, who runs Hotel la Encarnaci&oacute;n, a picturesque bed-and-breakfast near the Unesco-recognised town of C&aacute;ceres in the western Extremadura region. “Things now are almost the same as they have been for the past few years, only now we’re accustomed to a new reality. It’s as if I went to live in London and spent the first few months complaining about the weather. Six years on and we have adapted to it.”</p> \n<p>Even the beleaguered property market is showing signs of life, though experts say a lot of the demand is coming from overseas, as the weaker euro attracts buyers from northern Europe looking for homes in tourist resorts.</p> \n<p>“The international market is doing very well indeed, but the local market is very different. There is no domestic demand at all,” says Marc Pritchard, Majorca-based sales and marketing director of Taylor Wimpey Espa&ntilde;a, which builds homes in popular coastal areas.</p> \n<p>Banks are not giving mortgages to many Spanish customers, he adds, and smaller property developers are struggling to get funding after so many went bankrupt during the crisis.</p> \n<p>Others in Spain’s property sector report similar trends. Martin Dell, who runs a property listing website, <a href=\"http://www.kyero.com\">kyero.com</a>, says interest from locals has collapsed: “The facts speak for themselves. In December 2007, 26% of all our inquiries came from Spanish speakers. That figure is now just 2%.”</p> \n<p>The lagging recovery for many Spaniards spells trouble for the PP: a general election is due by the end of the year. Recent corruption scandals were another factor in its poor showing in the local elections. This has opened the way for new parties, such as Podemos on the left and the liberal-minded Ciudadanos.</p> \n<p>Like the Conservatives in Britain, the PP, which has been in office since the end of 2011, sticks to its message on the economy: we know it has been bad, they say, but the medicine is working and things are getting better.</p> \n<p>It argues it has held off an even worse crisis as it tries to reduce the deficit, calm investors and lower Spain’s borrowing costs. Reforms, including changes to employment law to make it easier for firms to hire and fire staff, have given firms much-needed flexibility, it argues.</p> \n<p>But it will need to do more to convince many voters. “Spaniards know there is a disconnect between the macro picture and what they are feeling. Usually when things are going well, people feel better. The [current] 3% [growth] is barely the start of what is needed to make up what has been lost,” says Angel Talavera of consultancy Oxford Economics.</p> \n<p>Many in Spain are already resigned to the idea the boom years will never return. For individuals and businesses, the struggle looks set to continue whatever the outcome of the vote this year.</p> \n<p>Daniel Roman’s new venture may well take off, and his personal situation may improve as he works all the hours available to him. But save for his shop, and a handful of grocers, butchers and fishmongers, the Mercado de la Cebada is still all but shuttered. If it is an example of an improving Spanish economy, it still has a long way to go.</p> \n<h2>Fragile revival in hardest-hit countries</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b41e719273e557f68346e486930287a82e860dd2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434800720672/164173ee-9c1d-4cbb-8992-485f6fb9f284-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Aerial view of Reykjavik\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iceland is now unwinding its capital controls.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jose Fuste Raga/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>As Greece fights for survival, four European countries have fared better over the past six years.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Iceland</strong><br />The island became an emblem of the 2008 crisis when the failure of its bloated banking system forced it to introduce capital controls. Its three largest banks collapsed in October 2008, having amassed loans worth 10 times more than the country’s annual economic output. It became the first rich nation in three decades to take a bailout from the IMF.</p> \n<p>The economy is now growing again, boosted by tourism and fisheries. This month, parliament approved measures to unwind capital controls and hopes ending the restrictions will draw a line under the financial crisis.</p> \n<p><strong>Ireland</strong><br />Like Iceland, Ireland’s economy was brought down by an outsize banking sector and it too was forced to seek help from the IMF. But unlike in Iceland, where there was large-scale debt forgiveness, consumers and the government were left with big piles of debt. Households saw the money tied up in their homes dwindle as property prices halved; workers had to swallow pay cuts and austerity measures introduced under Ireland’s EU/IMF bailout. But Ireland exited its bailout programme in 2013 and last year enjoyed the fastest growth in the EU.</p> \n<p><strong>Portugal</strong><br />Portugal was bailed out by the EU and IMF with €78bn (&pound;56bn) in 2011. It made a successful return to the bond markets in 2014 – the first auction of government debt for three years – and left the rescue programme shortly after. Now its economy is growing again and Portugal has started repaying its bailout. But with its debt-to-GDP ratio still high at more than 120%, there are fears that a disorderly Grexit could lead to contagion and send yields on its government bonds soaring.</p> \n<p><strong>Cyprus</strong><br />Cyprus’s near-collapse in 2013 forced it to go to the EU, the ECB and IMF for €10bn in emergency aid. In return, the government was forced to shut down the country’s second-biggest lender and “bail in” banks that, through overexposure to debt-stricken Greece, had caused the meltdown. Capital controls were imposed and savers with more than €100,000 suffered massive losses. Two years on, Cyprus is recovering. But rating agency Fitch recently highlighted it as one of the most vulnerable countries to Grexit. <strong>Katie Allen</strong></p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434797645542/Sunlight-over-central-Mad-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sunlight over central Madrid: Spain's economy is notionally back to 95% of its 2008 capacity.
