The current market in Gaza is not able to offer jobs leaving a large population in despair particularly the youth,” said Steen Lau Jorgensen, World Bank country director for West Bank and Gaza. </p> \n<p>“The ongoing blockade and the 2014 war have taken a toll on Gaza’s economy and people’s livelihoods. Gaza’s exports virtually disappeared and the manufacturing sector has shrunk by as much as 60%. The economy cannot survive without being connected to the outside world.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5d24a540426dadd7f4f6ade7cb0589b6e79e34bd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432283609274/553dea81-a06e-4836-9ef9-36158267af28-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Smuggling tunnels \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smuggling tunnels have been the lifeline of the Gazan economy during the Israeli-Egyptian blockade.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos/Antonio Olmos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In uncompromising terms, the World Bank describes Gaza’s economy as “tremendously damaged by repeated armed conflicts, the blockade and internal divide” and “reduced to a fraction of its estimated potential”.<br /></p> \n<p>The coastal enclave, governed by the Islamist group Hamas since 2007, has struggled with mounting problems since the closure of the smuggling tunnels to Egypt, which had acted as an economic and social pressure valve.</p> \n<p>Hamas has struggled to pay salaries and also lost a key stream of revenue from its taxation of the smuggling route. The Rafah terminal, on the border with Egypt, has largely been closed by Cairo since October when Egypt began work to create a buffer zone along the border and step up efforts to destroy the cross-border tunnel trade.</p> \n<p>The report adds that real GDP per person has dropped by a third in the last 20 years.</p> \n<p>The report, to be presented next week, says events in the last two years – including Egypt’s closure of the smuggling tunnels and last summer’s war – had reduced Gaza’s economy by almost half a billion dollars.</p> \n<p>“The closure of tunnels with Egypt and in particular the 2014 summer war,” say the report’s authors, “shaved some $460moff Gaza’s economy, leading to a 15% contraction of its GDP. </p> \n<p>They add: “In Gaza, unemployment increased by as much as 11 percentage points to reach 43% – the highest in the world – and that in the West Bank it dropped by 1 percentage point. </p> \n<p>“In Gaza, the poverty rate reached 39% and with poverty in the West Bank at 16%, the aggregate poverty rate amounted to 25%. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"188782a6b5ddc3bf56e48d22c822156b28b80977\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432283720323/f9649a6e-17d7-4a5f-991d-09b9936569fd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Palestinian boy waits for customers at a market in Gaza City\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Palestinian boy waits for customers at a market in Gaza City.

If it were compared to that of other economies, unemployment in Gaza would be the highest in the world.</p> \n<p>“Poverty in Gaza is also very high. This is despite the fact that nearly 80% of Gaza’s residents receive some aid. These numbers, however, fail to portray the degree of suffering of Gaza’s citizens due to poor electricity and water/sewerage availability, war-related psychological trauma, limited movement, and other adverse effects of wars and the blockade.”</p> \n<p>The report also criticised the lacklustre pace of reconstruction and aid to Gaza since last year’s conflict.

It said she was guilty of using violence against flight attendants. A lower court had earlier sentenced Cho to a year in prison. She has been locked up since her December arrest.</p> \n<p>Cho achieved worldwide notoriety after an onboard tantrum triggered when a first class flight attendant served her macadamia nuts in a bag instead of on a dish. Cho, head of the airline’s cabin service at the time, had a heated physical confrontation with members of the crew.</p> \n<p>Swarmed by reporters at the court, she made no comment in front of the TV cameras, bowing her head and burying her face in her hands as the media pressed in and yelled for her to say something.</p> \n<p>The incident was a lightning rod for anger in a country where the economy is dominated by family-run conglomerates known as <em>chaebol</em> that often appear to be above the law.</p> \n<p>A lower court had convicted Cho of forcing a flight to change its route, obstructing the flight’s captain in the performance of his duties, forcing a crew member off a plane and assaulting a crew member. It found her not guilty of interfering with a transport ministry investigation into the incident. Cho pleaded not guilty and prosecutors had called for three years in prison.</p> \n<p>The aviation security law is meant to regulate highly dangerous acts such as hijacking. The upper court said on Friday that there was not a big safety threat posed by Cho’s actions and returning the plane that was taxiing did not constitute forcing a change in the plane’s route.</p> \n<p>Kim Sang-hwan, head of the three-judge upper court panel, cited her “internal change” since she began serving her prison term as a reason for lessening the sentence.</p> \n<p>The upper court also took into consideration that Cho is the mother of 2-year-old twins and had never committed any offence before.

Porter and White both face a total of 25 years rather than 20. Rice, Nero and Miller saw their potential prison terms reduced by five years each. Rice now faces up to 25 years, while Nero and Miller face 15 each. </p> \n<p>The state’s attorney’s office ran an independent investigation into Gray’s death at the same time as Baltimore police conducted their own inquiry.
