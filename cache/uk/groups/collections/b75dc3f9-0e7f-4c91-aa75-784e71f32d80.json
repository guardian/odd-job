We see that as a medical emergency because the action we ned to do to stop that in its tracks and get us back onto a 2C trajectory or less requires action now – and action in the next ten years – otherwise the game could be over.”</p> \n<p>The comprehensive analysis sets out the direct risks to health, including heatwaves, floods and droughts, and indirect – but no less deadly – risks, including air pollution, spreading diseases, famines and mental ill-health. A rapid phase-out of coal from the global energy mix is among the commission’s top recommendations, given the millions of premature deaths from air pollution this would prevent.</p> \n<p>The report states that political will is now the major barrier to delivering a low-carbon economy and the associated improvements to health and poverty, not finance or technology.</p> \n<p>The authors argue that health has been neglected from the climate change debate. It says doctors and other health professionals must take a leading role in ending society’s “addiction” to fossil fuels, having confronted “powerful entrenched interests”, such as the tobacco industry, in the past.</p> \n<p>“A public health perspective has the potential to unite all actors behind a common cause — the health and wellbeing of our families, communities, and countries,” the report states. “These concepts are far more tangible and visceral than tonnes of atmospheric CO2, and are understood and prioritised across all populations.” </p> \n<p>The commission is seeking consciously to shift the balance from what Costello called “catastrophism” to a far more positive message about the potential for improving human health. </p> \n<p>“We are getting fatter, we’re getting heart attacks, strokes, diabetes, respiratory ill-health, depression, anxiety and virtually all of things we want to do to protect us against climate change will improve our health, whether it’s active transport – walking, cycling – eating healthier sustainable local diets or cutting air pollution. All of that will have a huge health dividend, health benefits and save a lot of money,” said Costello.</p> \n<p>The report is the latest in a line of significant interventions in the run-up to a <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/global-climate-talks\">crunch UN climate summit in Paris</a> in December, when nations hope to agree a global deal on cutting emissions.

In May, financial experts at the International Monetary Fund revealed that the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/may/18/fossil-fuel-companies-getting-10m-a-minute-in-subsidies-says-imf\">full costs of fossil fuels being picked up by taxpayers</a> runs at $10m (&pound;6m) per minute, more than the total spent on healthcare by the world’s governments.</p> \n<p>Chan said the latest Lancet/UCL commission report was “very timely”, coming a few months ahead of the Paris conference. The first commission report, which warned that “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2009/may/13/climate-change-health-impact\">climate change is the greatest health threat of the 21st century</a>”, was published in 2009 ahead of the ultimately unsuccessful UN climate summit in Copenhagen.</p> \n<p>Chan highlighted the huge benefits to be gained by tackling air pollution, shown by the new report. “Air pollution is one of the most important health risk factors globally, comparable to tobacco smoking, and the largest killer in some countries,” she said.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/apr/02/air-pollution-may-cause-more-uk-deaths-than-previously-thought-say-scientists\">Deaths from air pollution are rising</a> around the world. The Lancet report cites research estimating that cutting carbon emissions would cut premature deaths from air pollution by 500,000 a year in 2030, 1.3m in 2050 and 2.2m in 2100, particularly in the heavily polluted cities of India and China. Other work in the US shows the boosts to human health can be worth 10 times the costs of cutting emissions.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-455909763__\n</div> \n<p>The report details the range of damage to health that global warming causes, including heatwaves whose deadly effects are rising around the world, for example in Russia in 2010 where 11,000 people died. Dengue fever is likely to spread, the report finds, and malaria cases may rise in some areas while falling in others. Cholera outbreaks occur when hurricanes mix waste and drinking water and extreme weather is increasing.</p> \n<p>Food shortages may increase as climate change harms crops and livestock and the ability to work in hot climates, the report states. Such shortages can lead people to migrate as refugees, leading to further health problems, or even to conflicts. People forced to move, whether by food shortages, floods or extreme storms, can suffer serious mental health problems. </p> \n<p>Mohga Kamal-Yann, Oxfam’s senior health policy advisor, said: “Rapid action to tackle global emissions and help communities adapt is crucial to reduce the threats of ill-health, hunger and additional hardship. Rich countries can and should make substantial cuts to their emissions by phasing out coal and by providing the funding that developing countries need to cope with climate change.” </p> \n<p>The Guardian’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/ng-interactive/2015/mar/16/keep-it-in-the-ground-guardian-climate-change-campaign\">Keep it in the Ground campaign</a> has been highlighting the impact of climate change on public health by focusing on the world’s two largest health charities – the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust.

when Israeli Druze attacked an Israeli military ambulance taking him to hospital for treatment, police said.</p> \n<p>“A crowd attacked an ambulance with stones near Majdal Shams on the Golan Heights,” as it was transporting two wounded Syrians, a police statement said, adding that one of the injured “died after the attack”.</p> \n<p>It said that the second Syrian was in a serious condition, and that two soldiers who were also inside the vehicle had been lightly wounded.</p> \n<p>The statement did not identify the Syrians or give further details about their injuries before the attack.</p> \n<p>There is growing concern for the fate of Syria’s Druze minority, traditional allies of President Bashar al-Assad, who are surrounded by rebels in the country’s more than four-year civil war.</p> \n<p>Public radio earlier said that around 200 Druze from Majdal Shams had pelted the ambulance with stones, forcing it to stop, and dragged the wounded Syrians from the vehicle.</p> \n<p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, called the incident “very serious” and said those behind the attack would be held to account.</p> \n<p>“We will not let anyone take the law into their hands and prevent the army from carrying out its mission,” he said in a statement, appealing for leaders in the Druze community to maintain calm. </p> \n<p>Tensions have flared in Druze areas of northern Israel and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights after rebels surrounded a government-held Druze village on the Syrian side last week.</p> \n<p>Israel’s Druze are concerned for the fate of their brethren in Syria, and the Israeli army has pledged to protect any refugees who flee towards the Jewish state.</p> \n<p>On 10 June, at least 20 Druze were killed in an unprecedented shootout with the al-Qaida-affiliated al-Nusra Front in north-west Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.</p> \n<p>Monday’s attack came hours after another group of Druze also blocked and threw stones at an army vehicle they believed was transferring wounded Syrian rebels for treatment, police said.</p> \n<p>Police spokeswoman Luba Samri said the first incident happened in the northern Israeli town of Horfish and that the Druze tried to check the identities of those inside the ambulance.</p> \n<p>The Druze threw stones at the vehicle as it tried to drive off, she said, adding that one Druze was moderately injured in the incident.</p> \n<p>Israel shares a ceasefire line with Syria on the Golan Heights, and has let hundreds of wounded Syrians into the country for medical treatment.</p> \n<p>Officials say there are 110,000 Druze in northern Israel, and another 20,000 in the Israeli-held Golan.</p> \n<p>Israel seized 1,200sq km (460sq miles) of the Golan Heights in the Six-Day War of 1967 and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community.</p> \n<p>

It looks like a Fox’s Glacier Mint has been plugged into a life support machine, but this humble chunk of see-through silicone is a model organ that could revolutionise the pharmaceutical industry, reducing the need for animal testing and speeding up the development of new drugs.</p> \n<p>Meet the <a href=\"http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpage/240/\">Lung-on-a-chip</a>, a simulation of the biological processes inside the human lung, developed by the <a href=\"http://wyss.harvard.edu/viewpage/461/\">Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering</a> at Harvard University – and now crowned <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/feb/19/designs-of-the-year-design-museum\">Design of the Year</a> by London’s Design Museum.</p> \n<p>Lined with living human cells, the “organs-on-chips” mimic the tissue structures and mechanical motions of human organs, promising to accelerate drug discovery, decrease development costs and potentially usher in a future of personalised medicine.</p> \n<p>“This is the epitome of design innovation,” says Paola Antonelli, design curator at New York’s Museum of Modern Art, who nominated the project for the award and <a href=\"http://www.moma.org/explore/inside_out/2015/03/04/is-this-for-everyone-new-design-acquisitions-at-moma\">recently acquired organs-on-chips for MoMA’s permanent collection</a>. “Removing some of the pitfalls of human and animal testing means, theoretically, that drug trials could be conducted faster and their viable results disseminated more quickly.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b66808f03f1f4c05855182ff6ea39bff07c19296\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434905854439/ee29bdf1-e027-4073-b5b3-9151672e7ee4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lung-on-a-chip … A tiny channel lined with human lung and capillary cells allows the biological processes of breathing to be simulated.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lung-on-a-chip … this channel lined with human lung and capillary cells allows the processes of breathing to be simulated.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wyss Institute/Design Museum</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The micro-devices work by recreating the tissue interfaces of human organs inside a transparent polymer “chip”, so the behaviours of bacteria, drugs and human white blood cells can be easily monitored through a microscope. A tiny channel runs through the middle, divided along its length by a porous membrane, with human lung cells on one side and blood capillary cells on the other. By running air through one side and a blood-like solution through the other, while applying a flexing and stretching motion using a vacuum, the chip can simulate the processes of breathing.</p> \n<p>“The organs-on-chips allow us to see biological mechanisms and behaviours that no one knew existed before,” says Don Ingber, founding director of the Wyss Institute. “We now have a window on the molecular-scale activities going on in human organs, including things that happen in human cells that don’t occur in animals. Most drug companies get completely different results in dogs, cats, mice and humans, but now they will be able to test the specific effects of drugs with greater accuracy and speed.”</p> \n<p>Ingber and his team have developed a number of different organs-on-chips to date, including a kidney, liver and peristaltic gut-on-a-chip, while skin-on-a-chip is currently in development for the cosmetics industry and for testing household cleaning products.</p> \n<p>The different organs can also be joined up in a network, allowing the journey of a drug to be followed through a simulated human body. The effects of an aerosol drug, of the kind dispensed by an asthma inhaler for example, can be observed in terms of how it enters the lungs, how it effects the heart, how it is metabolised by the liver and how it is excreted by the kidneys, with any adverse side-effects monitored along the way in real time. Four organs have already been tested together for a two-week trial period and in two years’ time, Ingber says they will have 10 organs up and running for a month-long test. So what next? Does this work lead the way to building an artificial human-on-a-chip?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Organs on chips Design of the Year\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/29463381\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"\" mozallowfullscreen=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>“We won’t be able to model consciousness, or the effect of gravity on your joints,” says Ingber. “But the next step is developing a truly personalised medicine. A drug can be tested on <em>your</em> lung, or <em>your</em> brain, not a dog’s, or the ‘average’ person doing a trial.”</p> \n<p>Named Design of the Year by a jury chaired by the artist Anish Kapoor, it is the first time the award has gone to a design from the field of medicine, beating off competition from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/may/28/google-self-driving-car-how-does-it-work\">Google’s self-driving car</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dezeen.com/2015/04/02/ocean-cleanup-boyan-slat-waste-designs-of-the-year-2015/\">a project to clean up plastic from the sea</a> and <a href=\"http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/opinion-marcel-designs-of-the-year\">an advertising campaign to convince people to buy misshapen fruit</a>.</p> \n<p>“One of the most important things about the Designs of the Year award is the chance that it gives the museum to explore new territory,” says Deyan Sudjic, director of the Design Museum. “The team of scientists that produced this remarkable object don’t come from a conventional design background. But what they have done is clearly a brilliant piece of design.”</p> \n<p>As for Ingber, who has five degrees from Yale in everything from medicine and chemistry to cell biology and molecular biophysics, design is just another string to his bow. “If design is placing elements in the optimal position to have optimal function,” he says, “it’s what we do here every day.”</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434905957949/76e0a1f8-f07b-4e52-ae03-7b8befba523b-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Wyss Institute/Design Museum","altText":"Organs-on-chips … Could this be the future of medicine without animal testing?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Wyss Institute/Design Museum"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434905854891/0a9872c7-3eec-46de-ba5e-a1bbd8c16e70-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lung-on-a-chip … this channel lined with human lung and capillary cells allows the processes of breathing to be simulated.
