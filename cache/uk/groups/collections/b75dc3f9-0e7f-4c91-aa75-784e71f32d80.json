The propaganda wing also issued a professionally produced video, Unity Of The Mujahideen Of The Caucasus, which included interviews with Russian-speaking militants in Iraq and Syria. Dozens more are easily available for download from their site.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p>Previous Russian-language output had been piecemeal, with most videos either without subtitles or arriving after the Arabic versions were broadcast. Much was produced from outside of Isis-controlled territory.</p> \n<p>Now Furat, which was announced on 5 June and began tweeting on 18 June, produces a mix of subtitled videos, addresses from Isis militants, DVDs, motivational messages, listicles, and propaganda in original Russian produced inside Syria and Iraq.</p> \n<p>Despite crackdowns on pro-Isis accounts by Twitter and Facebook, the number broadcasting and sharing Jihadi material is vast – the <a href=\"http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/research/files/papers/2015/03/isis-twitter-census-berger-morgan/isis_twitter_census_berger_morgan.pdf\">Bookings Institute</a> in late 2014 estimated that there were over 46,000 accounts with over a thousand followers used by Isis supporters.</p> \n<p>Furat has so far been resilient to official takedowns, though its homepages on Russian social website VKontakte have been closed. A Facebook account has already been banned but the group opened a new, closed one in July. Just over a week later, the group had nearly 250 members.</p> \n<h2>Formalising operations</h2> \n<p>That Russian-speaking militants in Syria are disseminating propaganda is nothing new. The various factions have had their own websites and social media accounts almost since they first emerged in Syria in late 2012.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"edffc3f80195ac89a5d44f99ae33b2a2326b6c84\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436445766015/0470caf8-b5e9-4ee1-bf67-d803fc8baeab-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Omar al-Shishani climbing out of a humvee, in an image from the militant's social media.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isis leader Omar al-Shishani climbing out of a humvee, in an image from the militant’s social media.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP via militant social media account</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/05/isis-russia-syria-islamic-extremism\">How Moscow’s migrant workers are being recruited to Isis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But as Isis’s Russian-speaking faction has grown in prominence and numbers, it has transformed its media operations into an increasingly slick and professional operation.</p> \n<p>The main precursor to Furat began life around early 2013 as <a href=\"http://fisyria.info/ \">FiSyria</a>, a website run by a group of Chechen militants led by Georgia-born Omar al-Shishani, according to <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303309504579181962177007316\">the Wall Street Journal</a>. At first, FiSyria was effectively Shishani’s personal site, offering news about battles he and his fellow Chechen militants were involved in. </p> \n<p>But when Shishani moved to Isis in late 2013, where he is now a military commander in Syria, FiSyria became a Russian-language Isis propaganda website. It now redirects to Furat, and a 5 June announcement confirmed that all Russian-language media production by would be done under the single brand. </p> \n<h2>Recruitment and retention</h2> \n<p>Furat’s main purpose is to recruit new Russian-speaking militants, both from the Russian Federation – particularly the North Caucasus – and elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, especially Central Asia.</p> \n<p>The media group also spreads Isis messages to Russian-speaking militants already in the group, both via social media and by creating and distributing subtitled CDs containing propaganda videos.</p> \n<p>Another important aim is to build ideological bridges between militants in Syria and Iraq, and those who are still in the North Caucasus. A recent Facebook post included photographs of a batch of CDs with an explanation that these were for “brothers in the caliphate”, the term used by Isis for territory under its control.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/infoFurat/statuses/616174822545092608\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"ru\" dir=\"ltr\">Media Center Furat Очередная партия дисков &quot;На Сраже 7&quot; для братьев в Халифате. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/furat?src=hash\">#furat</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7?src=hash\">#Кавказ</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/7LqP2Ow6An\">pic.twitter.com/7LqP2Ow6An</a></p>— Furatinfo (@infoFurat) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/infoFurat/status/616174822545092608\">July 1, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/04/isis-love-letters-chechens-syria\">'Found' letters of love and poetry by Chechen fighters in Syria posted online</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By translating Arabic-language material into Russian, Furat is able to ensure that all Russian-speakers in Isis-controlled territories have access to the same messages and ideology as their Arabic-speaking counterparts.</p> \n<p></p> \n<p><em>A version of this article originally appeared on <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/content/is-boosts-russian-language-propagangda-efforts/27112518.html\">RFE/RL</a></em></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436460739452/3437c54a-64cb-462f-b582-5eb479741e82-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"screengrab","altText":"A screengrab from Unity Of The Mujahideen Of The Caucasus, a production by Furat Media.

The largest is 1.5km across the rim and rises 700m from the sea floor. The 20km-long volcano cluster is nearly 5km underwater.<br /></p> \n<p>Professor Iain Suthers, a marine biologist at the University of NSW, said the volcano discovery was made when the team was searching for nursery grounds for larval lobsters.</p> \n<p>“My jaw just dropped,” Suthers told Guardian Australia. “I immediately said, ‘What are they doing there and why didn’t we know about them before?’ It really backs up the statement that we know more about the surface of the moon than our sea floor.</p> \n<p>“I’m elated. We went there to look at eddies in the east Australia current and it was completely serendipitous to find this volcano cluster. We can only just imagine what will be around the corner if we continue to scan this area.”</p> \n<p>Scientists believe the volcanoes were created by a series of shifts in geological plates that caused Australia to split from New Zealand. Suthers said the area was thought to be “billiard-table flat” but the enhanced mapping capability of the Investigator unveiled the calderas.</p> \n<p>The 94-metre Investigator was commissioned by the CSIRO in 2009 via $120m from the federal government. The vessel, which undertook its first sea tests in March, can map the seafloor at any depth, whereas its ageing predecessor, the Southern Surveyor, was limited to 3,000 metres.</p> \n<p>Professor Richard Arculus, an igneous petrologist and volcano expert at the Australian National University, said the Investigator’s mapping ability has unveiled an “enormously exciting” discovery. </p> \n<p>“They tell us part of the story of how New Zealand and Australia separated around 40m to 80m years ago, and they’ll now help scientists target future exploration of the sea floor to unlock the secrets of the Earth’s crust,” he said.</p> \n<p>The team of 28 scientists, led by Suthers, included researchers from NSW, Latrobe, British Columbia, Sydney, Auckland, Technology Sydney and Southern Cross universities. The voyage left Brisbane on 3 June and arrived in Sydney on 18 June.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jun/04/science-funding-cuts-are-generating-fears-for-jobs-and-research-output\">Science funding cuts are generating fears for jobs and research output</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Suthers said it was “inevitable” that other undiscovered volcanoes were in the region, but the Investigator has funding to operate at sea for only 180 days a year. For the rest of the year it is tied up at a wharf in Hobart.</p> \n<p>“We should thank Canberra for the funding we do have but it’s frustrating to build a state-of-the-art vessel only to have it sitting in a wharf for six months of the year,” Suthers said.</p> \n<p>“This is a vessel that Australia has been crying out for for decades. It’s an incredibly stable vessel for those of us who are seasick. Usually when you’re hit by four-metre waves you lose a couple of days of research because you’re vomiting.”</p> \n<p>A spokeswoman for Ian Macfarlane, the industry and science minister, said the shortfall was because Labor “left absolutely no money in the budget” to operate the Investigator. </p>","section":"Australia","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/71c4279a9e184d0cdd6eb354713f5cb0ce3c6aba/0_0_1713_1028/1713.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1028,"width":1713,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Marine National Facility","altText":"Extinct underwater volcanoes, which are likely to be 50 million years old, situated about 250 km off the coast of Sydney, Australia.

In an interview with the Guardian in March Karzai insisted he would keep quiet and advise Ghani behind the scenes. “I absolutely support this government,” he said. </p> \n<p>Many, however, question how genuine this assertion is. A senior western diplomat told the Guardian that Karzai has been trying for months to undercut Ghani’s government, with the intention of bringing it down. Should this happen, an interim government would likely take over, and Karzai would step forward to fill the vacuum as the self-styled father of the nation, the diplomat said.</p> \n<p>Aware of Karzai’s intentions, but keen to avoid an open clash he might not win, Ghani has in the past tolerated the former president’s manoeuvres to a certain extent. “In the political game, Karzai is leagues ahead of almost everyone else here. Frankly, he is leagues ahead of us too. It just took us a while to figure it out,” the same source said.</p> \n<p>A presidential aide who regularly meets Karzai agreed. “Karzai knows everyone in this country. Ghani does not,” he said. </p> \n<p>The former president denies he is building up opposition. “Meeting tribal leaders and elders from around the country is nothing new for Mr Karzai. This is how it used to be during the last 14 years,” said Aimal Faizi, a long-time aide.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eacffc2fbb3f296a4837ab76857aea9ce8bfe89c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/eacffc2fbb3f296a4837ab76857aea9ce8bfe89c/0_0_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It is the Afghan political culture and also his personal style,” he said. “The strong bond between President Karzai and Afghan elders and leaders from all around the country can not be ignored by either side.” </p> \n<p>Either way, Ghani now seems to have had enough. Last month on a trip to Kandahar, he struck back.</p> \n<p>Kandahar is a Karzai stronghold and home to his half-brother Shah Wali Karzai, who heads the Popalzai tribe and wields considerable influence. The former president ruled largely through patronage, building personal relations with strongmen whose excesses and corruption he is accused of ignoring. They now stand in the way of Ghani’s pledge to centralise power and create more transparency.</p> \n<p>“There are lots of warlords in Kandahar. They are like rats,” said Mohammad Yusuf, a member of the provincial council. “The Karzai government dug channels for the rats underground, brought them to government, made them officials, and today they have power.”</p> \n<p>According to local media, Ghani told a group of civil society members: “From now on, there are no parallel governments in Kandahar.” The newly appointed governor, Humayun Azizi, was his official representative, he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/19/afghan-backlash-over-governments-security-deal-with-pakistan\">Afghan backlash over security deal with Pakistan</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When Ghani came to Kandahar, one of the strongest power brokers in the south, the police chief Lt Gen Abdul Raziq, made a point of leaving town.</p> \n<p>“What did piss off the Ghani camp was that ahead of Ghani’s visit, people close to Karzai rang around to tribal leaders and said ‘don’t turn up’,” a western security official said. The president’s advisers supposedly convinced the elders to come after all, but the incident reinforced the impression that Ghani has very little wiggle room.</p> \n<p>“You don’t want your former boss breathing down your neck,” the same source said.</p> \n<p>The conflict between Ghani and Karzai came to a head with a memorandum of understanding signed in May between the Afghan and Pakistani spy agencies and confirmed by Pakistan’s army, to enhance intelligence cooperation. Many Afghans saw the deal as selling out to a sworn enemy.</p> \n<p>The deal gave Karzai a platform to launch an attack on Ghani that chimed with public opinion. As a result, he has come to be seen by many as a protector of national sovereignty. To reinforce this image, he keeps up a busy travel schedule to countries uncomfortable with closer Afghan-Pakistani cooperation such as India, China and Russia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1951e2fdd589943e4f697133ba70d3e3c95b2419\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/1951e2fdd589943e4f697133ba70d3e3c95b2419/120_5_4032_2420/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hamid Karzai meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hamid Karzai meets Vladimir Putin in Moscow</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mikhail Klimentyev/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Faizi, Karzai’s aide, said Afghans were right to protest against the memorandum, “which is against the national interests of their country. The protest is [not] against individuals but against inappropriate policies of the Afghan government.”</p> \n<p>Karzai may partly be fighting for his legacy. In rooting out corruption, Ghani will inevitably target people who amassed astonishing fortunes on the former president’s watch. </p> \n<p>Karzai allies have been sidelined, among them the former vice-president Yunus Qanuni and the intelligence chief Rahmatullah Nabil, who opposed the memorandum with Pakistan. That puts Karzai in an awkward position given his tacit support for Ghani during the elections.</p> \n<p>“Karzai feels like Ghani wouldn’t have gotten the presidency without him,” said the western security official.</p> \n<p>The infighting could have wider repercussions, said Haroon Mir, a political analyst, pointing out that Ghani needs wide political support to begin peace talks with the Taliban.</p> \n<p>“It’s not good at this time to lose political support or create opportunities for political opposition to emerge,” Mir said.</p> \n<p>If Ghani has tried to send a message to Karzai to back off, the former president is unlikely to comply. Aides and analysts agree that he is positioning himself as the only viable alternative to a government that so far has not delivered.</p> \n<p>“Karzai knows a lot of games, and one of his games is the <em>loya jirga</em>,” Ghani’s aide said, referring to the assembly that can pave the way for, among other things, a change in the constitution. Afghan presidents can currently only serve two terms, which Karzai has already done, but if he rallies support for a <em>loya jirga</em>, he can mount a challenge on a whole different level.</p> \n<p>Karzai “is the only known political leader of Afghanistan”, Mir said. “He has all the ingredients to be a national leader – many resources, political support, his own network of influential people.
