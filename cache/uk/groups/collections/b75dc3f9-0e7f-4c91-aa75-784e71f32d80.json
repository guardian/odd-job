Nepal’s government is desperate to change the narrative after April’s disaster, which killed almost 9,000 people, in time for the peak tourist season in October and November. Visitors bring in $1.6bn to a poor country whose economy has been recovering from a decade-long civil war (1996-2006).</p> \n<p>Despite a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/nepal\">severe travel warning</a> from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) having being in effect – though as of 3 July the FCO no longer advises against all but essential travel to the whole of Nepal – many leading adventure travel companies are planning to return in the near future, including <a href=\"http://www.exodus.co.uk/\">Exodus</a> and <a href=\"https://www.gadventures.co.uk/\">G Adventures</a>. Fiona Marshall of <a href=\"http://www.keadventure.com/\">KE Adventure Travel</a> says: “We’ve decided to operate in Nepal this autumn. Bookings are slow, but that’s natural.

Of 75 districts, only 14 suffered damage. Almost all national parks and protected areas, including the fabulous wildlife sanctuaries of <a href=\"http://www.chitwannationalpark.gov.np/\">Chitwan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.bardia-adventure.com/\">Bardia</a>, are functioning normally. The world’s third-highest mountain Kangchenjunga was unaffected. Nepal’s only international airport in Kathmandu remained open throughout the critical weeks and most of the road network was left intact. The exception is the heavily used road into Tibet via Kodari, which remains closed and highly dangerous following fresh landslides triggered during the monsoon.</p> \n<p>Gordon Steer of <a href=\"http://worldexpeditions.co.uk/\">World Expeditions</a> says it will be operating most of its treks from September. “The FCO’s [previous] advice has had a impact. Bookings are down. However, we’ve been doing this for 40 years and we’re confident we can run our trips safely. We’re doing research in our most popular areas, including the Annapurna region and Everest. There was some damage in the Everest region, but many people will barely notice. We’re waiting to hear about Manaslu [the world’s eighth highest mountain]; the army is doing a survey. We won’t be going to places like Langtang and Rolwaling.”</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/langtangearthquakeappeal?fref=ts\">Langtang valley</a> used to be Nepal’s third-busiest trekking destination, popular with independent “tea-house” trekkers and accessible by bus. But the valley suffered some of the worst destruction during the earthquake as a huge landslide swept off the peak of Langtang Lirung to bury the village below. Almost 400 people died, including about 60 trekkers. Despite the damage, and continuing landslides, a local relief agency is organising two volunteer treks in the autumn to Langtang, and a memorial trek has been scheduled for spring.</p> \n<p>Half a million people in Nepal work in tourism, more than half of them women, and the World Travel and Tourism Council says that figure could have risen to 700,000 in the next decade. But a recently published post-disaster report commissioned by the government shows tourist numbers fell by 90% after the earthquake. It warns that the Nepali tourism industry could shrink this year by 40% from 2014 levels. There are fears that if visitors stay away more young people will be forced to leave the country to look for work elsewhere in Asia and in gulf states like <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/24/qatar-denies-nepalese-world-cup-workers-leave-after-earthquakes\">Qatar, where migrant workers face abuse</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"617d23c20a41a34f74c693d8258f6fa1154fa0b3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435933198866/ba3b739e-233e-4f81-acb7-0710a691cdb8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Trekker beneath Kangchenjunga.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trekker beneath Kangchenjunga.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Monteath/ Hedgehog Hous</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/may/25/nepal-one-month-after-earthquake-emotional-impact-devastating\">Nepal one month after the quake: 'The emotional impact has been devastating' | Sam Jones</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The FCO’s initial travel warning made it difficult for tourists to find travel insurance for Nepal. Shiva Dhakal, owner of <a href=\"http://royalmt.com.np/\">Royal Mountain Travel</a>, one of Nepal’s biggest travel agencies, says: “Travel insurance is the major problem for us right now. Because of the negative travel advisory [previously] given by the UK government, travellers from the UK are scared.” The Guardian contacted 10 adventure travel insurance agents last week; all of them said they wouldn’t currently cover Nepal, though the British Mountaineering Council (<a href=\"https://www.thebmc.co.uk/autumn-trekking-in-nepal-will-bmc-travel-insurance-cover-me\">thebmc.co.uk</a>) is offering insurance for trekkers, including to Kathmandu, though only on a case-by-case basis to the most affected areas.</p> \n<p>Nepal’s tourism industry is trying hard to reassure potential visitors and their governments. Hotels in Kathmandu have been surveyed, with 90% cleared to operate normally, including hotels in heritage buildings, like Patan’s recently restored <a href=\"http://theinnpatan.com/\">The Inn</a>. Several trekking agents have already carried out their own surveys while the Nepali organisation <a href=\"http://samarth-nepal.com/\">Samarth</a>, funded by the UK’s Department for International Development, has commissioned a report from specialist earthquake engineering firm Miyamoto to assess Nepal’s two most popular trekking regions, Annapurna and Everest. That report is due in the middle of July. Post-disaster reports suggest 150km of tourist trekking trails suffered significant damage.</p> \n<p>While trekking and other adventure activities account for 40% of Nepal’s visitors, the remaining 60% come for the stunning cultural and religious heritage, which was badly damaged during the earthquakes. Almost all the World Heritage Sites in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/01/nepal-begins-to-assess-its-cultural-losses-after-earthquake\">Kathmandu Valley</a> have now reopened despite strongly worded concerns about structural safety from Unesco itself.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4572b0bfc5670ce316152ef9213a302c10bb8a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435932887887/fe71af8b-e95b-4ab8-93a2-4d3a5c02cc2e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dhaulagiri and prayer flags at sunrise from Poon Hill, Ghorepani.

The square is open to visitors and so is the Patan Museum.” Recently developed methods for seismic strengthening, he says, have made a big difference.</p> \n<p>Other famous sites in the valley, including Kathmandu’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/jan/09/kathmandu-nepal-everest-kenton-cool-way-i-see-it\">Durbar Square</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/01/nepal-begins-to-assess-its-cultural-losses-after-earthquake\">Swayambhunath</a>, known as the Monkey Temple, fared worse; these are the places Unesco has singled as being of most concern. A safer option is to join the crowds of Tibetans and Sherpas at the vast stupa at Boudha in the east of the city, spinning prayer wheels at dusk. The only one of Kathmandu’s World Heritage Sites still closed is the temple complex at Changu Narayan.</p> \n<p>Schrom, who has prepared a post-disaster assessment for Unesco, says more than 700 listed structures have been damaged, a fifth of them destroyed completely. The Department of Archaeology says it will need at least $100m to restore Nepal’s cultural heritage in the Kathmandu Valley and other affected districts but Schrom says that figure is an underestimate.

It gave no details of which companies would be allowed to list but said the amount of money raised also would be reduced from June’s level.</p> \n<p>Hexun.com, a financial news website, said 28 companies had planned to go public in the next two weeks.</p> \n<p>The latest moves followed a surprise interest rate cut on 27 June that was interpreted as a clear signal that Beijing wanted to shore up investor confidence.</p> \n<p>The explosive price rises that saw the stock market double in value began after the official media said last summer that stocks were cheap. Companies rushed to raise money with share offerings to take advantage of investor enthusiasm.</p> \n<p>Some analysts said the fall since last month was a belated symptom of China’s economic woes after a slowdown in activity dating back to early last year. Manufacturing output and exports have slowed, while the finance ministry has clamped down on lending by state enterprises and local authorities for property speculation. <br /></p> \n<p>Officially, GDP growth is expected to remain at 7% this year, in line with the government’s target, but many analysts say that official figures overestimate actual growth and it is in fact nearer 3%.</p> \n<p>Stuart Kirk, a strategy analyst at Deutsche Bank, queried why regulators eased lending rules this week.</p> \n<p>He said: “After all, shares are still up 90% since the lows in 2013 and valuations remain frothy. The reality, however, is most investors are in the red – in fact, it is likely no money has been made during this equity boom whatsoever. The reason is because peak inflows occurred just before the recent selloff; money lost by latecomers is greater than gains made by earlier investors.”</p> \n<p> More than 20m trading accounts were opened between mid-April and mid-June to invest in the rising market and it is these accounts that have seen the biggest losses, he said.</p> \n<p>A prolonged slump could disrupt Communist party plans to use stock markets to make China’s state-dominated economy more productive. The party wants state companies to raise money through share sales to reduce debt and hopes they will compete harder if they have to answer to shareholders.</p> \n<p>Party leaders also hope stock investing can provide an ageing population with more options to save for retirement and ease demand for social spending.</p> \n<p><br /></p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435948121884/1e7caa93-deec-49fe-bf9d-bbd36ddb9441-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Aly Song/Reuters","altText":"A brokerage house in Shanghai, China.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Aly Song/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T18:29:09Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:08:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":75,"contributors":[{"name":"Phillip Inman","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/phillipinman"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Chinese economy","Stock markets","Business","China","World news","Asia Pacific"],"tags":[{"id":"business/chinese-economy","webTitle":"Chinese economy"},{"id":"business/stock-markets","webTitle":"Stock markets"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Phillip Inman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/phillipinman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jul/03/chinas-stock-market-slump-continues","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ac6k","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/jul/03/chinas-stock-market-slump-continues","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jul/03/chinas-stock-market-slump-continues"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435948121884/1e7caa93-deec-49fe-bf9d-bbd36ddb9441-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A brokerage house in Shanghai, China.
