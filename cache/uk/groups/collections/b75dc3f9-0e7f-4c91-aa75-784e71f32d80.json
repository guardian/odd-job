And there has been his belief that small things can lead to big things in his splintered country. </p> \n<p>Now, at 68, ensconced beneath the arches in the white, colonial-era office that has been the headquarters of every Turkish Cypriot leader since independence, Akinci <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/28/mustafa-akinci-solve-cyprus-problem-turkey-election\">has his chance to act</a>. </p> \n<p>“We have had enough of suffering,” he told the Guardian in an interview conducted, in part, under a pergola in his garden. “Yes, it is important to admit that suffering took place, that it was mutual, that mistakes were made,” he said of the inter-communal strife that has long estranged Greeks and Turks on Cyprus. “But it is also high time that we look to the future.” </p> \n<p>For Turkish Cypriots, living in what officials politely describe as a state of limbo, the future would mean cohabitation with their Greek compatriots in an island reunited as a federal state.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-ea2cce8f-ba85-4df8-a6de-720f8431f72e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433144854429/8ae4e2d1-347f-4324-8ea6-1e57c4bd259f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mustafa Akinci\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mustafa Akinci, the recently-elected Turkish Cypriot leader</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Artun Korudag</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It has taken Akinci, a three-time mayor of Turkish-controlled Nicosia, Europe’s last divided capital, more than 40 years to get here. And he comes with impeccable credentials. When bi-communal contacts were publicly eschewed, the leftwing moderate was going in the opposite direction, working with his Greek counterpart to establish what to this day remains among the most durable exemplars of reconciliation: a common sewage system that spans both sides of Nicosia’s UN-patrolled “dead zone”.</p> \n<p>Almost 41 summers have elapsed since Turkish troops – responding to a coup aimed at <em>enosis</em>, or union, with Greece – invaded the island in what Ankara has long viewed as its greatest military victory since the sack of Smyrna in 1922. </p> \n<p>With the army’s seizure of the island’s northern third, about 200,000 Greek Cypriots were forced to flee south as about 40,000 Turkish Cypriots ran the other way. In their separate spheres, the exchange of populations cemented decades of bloodshed and division with the Turkish Republic of North Cyprus unilaterally proclaiming independence in 1983. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Map of divided Cyprus\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1433098941076/cyprus_north.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I feel I live in a very abnormal country</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Fikri Toros, Turkish Cypriot chamber of commerce</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Ever since, one of the world’s most intractable ethnic disputes has defied mediation. Cyprus has come to represent a graveyard for high-level diplomats courting failure. But the election of Akinci may be the game-changer so desperately needed to break the deadlock.<br /></p> \n<p>In his four weeks in power, the soft-spoken peacenik has wasted little time. First came a decision to <a href=\"http://en.cihan.com.tr/news/Turkish-Cyprus-lifts-visa-requirement-for-Greek-Cyprus-_7169-CHMTc4NzE2OQ==\">dispense with the visa requirement</a> for his self-declared state; then a highly symbolic stroll, arm in arm, across the island’s buffer zone with Greek Cypriot president Nicos Anastasiades; and last week, an array of confidence-building measures ranging from increasing the crossing points connecting the two communities to linking mobile telephone and electricity grids – widely seen as the most positive signs yet that inter-ethnic relations are on the mend.</p> \n<p>In Anastasiades, who heads Cyprus’ internationally recognised south, Akinci has found a willing partner. At talks held this month – the first since they were stalled last October – both leaders agreed to personally participate in the process and meet regularly.</p> \n<p>For both men – contemporaries who hail from the southern town of Limassol – the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/14/cyprus-peace-talks-raise-hopes-end-conflict-haunted-europe\">resumption of negotiations</a> has never been more pressing. Time, they both agree, is the great adversary.</p> \n<p>“The passage of time is not helping a solution,” sighed Akinci, mourning the loss of common memories of co-existence. “The more time passes, the more the division becomes consolidated. This is a fact that everyone should understand.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/28/mustafa-akinci-solve-cyprus-problem-turkey-election\">Is Mustafa Akinci the best hope yet for a solution to the Cyprus problem? | George Kyris</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Few, it seems, understand this more than Akinci’s own constituency.

Young Turkish Cypriots are unable to participate in international sporting events. And when the Olympic torch arrived in Cyprus before the London Games in 2012, they were denied the pleasure of seeing it because no insurance company would cover its passage through an area perceived to be governed by an illegal regime. </p> \n<p>“Even cultural contacts are restrained,” Nami lamented. “Take the recent European song contest. It was impossible to nominate someone. Even if we had applied, no one would reply!”</p> \n<p>While tourism is booming and per capita income has reached $11,500 (&pound;7,500) – compared with $26,000 in the south – Turkish Cypriots, more than ever, are yearning for normality in a state that not only functions but does so independently out of the shadow of an increasingly authoritarian Turkey. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It is increasingly normal for Turkish Cypriots to come over for the clubs and bars and beach.

We have to have empathy. When we look at them, and they look at us, it is important that it is not enemies but future partners that we see.”</p> \n<p>With reunification, would come international law and order. “The younger generation has a very blurred picture of the future. They don’t know what tomorrow will bring.”</p> \n<p>Growing numbers have, in fact, voted with their feet – either emigrating or moving two steps ahead of politicians.</p> \n<p>Since 2003 when checkpoints were first opened, ever more Turkish Cypriots have availed themselves of services in the south – seeking healthcare there, dining in its finer restaurants and, in the case of those who can afford it, sending their children to English-language schools.</p> \n<p>Among them is Esra Aygin, a journalist, who thinks nothing of crossing the UN-patrolled “green line”.</p> \n<p>“At 7am you’ll see lots of cars at the checkpoints with kids strapped in the backseat being taken to school,” she enthused, driving her daughter back across the buffer zone from ballet class. “It is becoming increasingly normal for Turkish Cypriots to also come over for the clubs and bars and the beach. They love Ayia Napa.”</p> \n<p>Open-minded and astute, Aygin is typical of the younger generation who want to savour their Cypriot heritage in a reunited Cyprus.</p> \n<p>At 35, she has no recollection of life before the invasion or any of its intra-ethnic woes. What she does know is that Cyprus is too small to be divided. “Turkish Cypriots see no future in this setup. The state that was established with the argument that it would be recognised hasn’t happened and will never happen,” she said. “It’s obvious that we will never be able to stand on our feet, or have a say in how this country is run, unless we have a solution.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/14/cyprus-peace-talks-raise-hopes-end-conflict-haunted-europe\">Cyprus peace talks raise hopes of an end to a conflict that has haunted Europe</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Islamification – in the form of enforced religious classes and mosque construction – of a Muslim society that is perhaps one of the most secular in the world has exacerbated the sense that time is running out.</p> \n<p>So, too, has the arrival of thousands of settlers from dirt-poor Anatolia: migrant workers who now exceed the 120,000 strong Turkish Cypriot population, who also turned out in droves to support Akinci.</p> \n<p>“After not being Turkish enough, we are told we are imperfect in another way by not being religious enough,” said Aygin. “There is a feeling that [in 1974] Turkey came and helped us but, ever since, has wanted us to pay. What we want is our dignity back.”</p> \n<p>Akinci says the message from Ankara is one of peace. “They want a solution and they want it sooner rather than later,” insisted the leader who was given a red-carpet welcome when he had his first official meeting with Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, the Turkish president, in May. </p> \n<p>“It is our fate as Turkish Cypriots and Greek Cypriots to live together on this island.

As civil society, we are really furious that lumping innovative finance and blending together has made it really difficult to push the boundaries on the intentional consensus on progressive taxes like financial transaction taxes,” she said. </p> \n<p>The UK’s aid watchdog recently <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/may/21/uk-aid-watchdog-dfid-public-private-partnerships-icai\">said </a>that Britain’s Department for International Development was failing to capitalise on partnerships with the private sector because of a lack of concrete targets and detailed operational plans.</p> \n<p>Eurodad also criticised the EU policy document for failing to back a push for an intergovernmental body under UN auspices to set global standards on tax.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>“It will look strange if the European Union, which prides itself on being democratic, defends the right of an exclusive club of countries to decide the global tax standards behind closed doors,” said Ryding.<br /></p> \n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.eurodad.org/finance_for_developing_countries\">a report last December</a>, Eurodad said that the world’s poorest countries had lost more than $2 for every $1 gained since 2008, with illicit financial flows, profits taken out by foreign companies, debt repayments and lending to rich countries responsible for most of the outflow.</p> \n<p>Saldanha said she feared the Addis meeting would deliver a weak agreement with low-level political support, noting that few European states were planning to send high-level delegations.<br /></p> \n<p>“The EU is just going to play the negotiations with whatever tactics they can to weaken the agreement to the lowest common denominator, so that whatever we get out of Addis will be so weak that we might as well have not had an agreement at all.”</p>","section":"Development","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432895320348/e0e3f044-c4fb-4523-9ab2-486ff8259074-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mohamed Dahir/AFP","altText":"Internally displaced Somali boys queue to receive food aid at a distribution centre funded by the UN agencies and the European Union, in Mogadishu, Somalia, 2009.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mohamed Dahir/AFP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T06:00:14Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T06:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Clár Ní Chonghaile","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/clar-ni-chonghaile"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["The future of development","Aid","Sustainable development goals","Millennium development goals","Global development","United Nations"],"tags":[{"id":"global-development/future-of-development","webTitle":"The future of development"},{"id":"global-development/aid","webTitle":"Aid"},{"id":"global-development/sustainable-development-goals","webTitle":"Sustainable development goals"},{"id":"global-development/millennium-development-goals","webTitle":"Millennium development goals"},{"id":"global-development/global-development","webTitle":"Global development"},{"id":"world/unitednations","webTitle":"United Nations"}],"section":{"id":"global-development"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Clár Ní Chonghaile","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/clar-ni-chonghaile"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"global-development"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/jun/01/european-union-aid-target-deadline-2020","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4994p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/global-development/2015/jun/01/european-union-aid-target-deadline-2020","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/jun/01/european-union-aid-target-deadline-2020"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432895320348/e0e3f044-c4fb-4523-9ab2-486ff8259074-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Internally displaced children queue to receive food aid at a distribution centre funded by UN agencies and the European Union in the Somali capital Mogadishu.

The cleric holding up the Qur’an could hardly disguise his amusement at the scene. <br /></p> \n<p>The 32-year-old midfielder, known as Ando – or Samurai, due to his hairstyle – is not shy of showing his Christianity, often crossing himself on the field. In April, Teymourian, who has played for Bolton Wanderers and Fulham, became the first Christian to lead Iran’s football team as its permanent captain. </p> \n<p>“I’m happy that as a Christian I play in a Muslim team,” he said <a href=\"http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/landslagsfotboll/article20554354.ab\">in a recent interview</a>. “I have Armenian roots but I hold the Iranian passport and I’m proud of that, I hold my flag high. I hope I can enhance the good reputation of Armenian people in Iran.”<br /></p> \n<p>Ethnic Armenians make up the majority of Iran’s estimated 300,000 Christians. Armenians are fully integrated in Iranian society, from the musician Loris Tjeknavorian to Sombat Hacoupian, who founded one of the country’s most famous men’s clothing brands and is now a household name. </p> \n<p>Although Islam is Iran’s official religion, it recognises Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians as accepted religious minorities. They are permitted their house of worship and usual religious services, and have reserved seats in the Iranian parliament. In a country where alcohol and pigmeat are forbidden, Christians are allowed to distil booze and eat pork. <br /></p> \n<p>There are at least 600 churches in Iran, including the sixth-century St Mary Church of Tabriz, mentioned by Marco Polo in his travel book. The adjacent province of West Azerbaijan boasts the ancient St Thaddeus Monastery, a Unesco world heritage site. <br /></p> \n<p>When Hassan Rouhani came to power in 2013, he appointed Ali Younesi, a former intelligence minister, to serve as his special assistant in minorities’ affairs. It was the first time such a position had been created. </p> \n<p>Significant improvements have since been made but many big challenges remain. <br /></p> \n<p>In April, as Iran’s northern neighbour, Armenia, commemorated the centenary of the 1915 genocide, the Iranian government, which is usually nervous about public gatherings, took a rare decision to allow Iranian Armenians to <a href=\"http://fararu.com/fa/news/231071/%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D9%88%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%AC%D9%85%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D9%87-%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%84-%D8%B3%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%AA%D8%B1%DA%A9%DB%8C%D9%87\">stage a protest</a> in front of the Turkish embassy in Tehran. <br /></p> \n<p>The official attitude towards other minorities has also changed. In February, Younesi announced that Jewish students officially no longer had to go to school on Saturdays, the sabbath day in the Hebrew calendar. Iranian school weeks run from Saturday to Thursday, and Friday is the end of the Iranian week. <br /></p> \n<p>“There are numerous reasons why my family left Iran in 1987, but an important one was the decision by the Iranian government that year not to officially recognise the holy sabbath as a religious day off for Jewish students,” an Iranian-Israeli, Meir Javedanfar, <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/iran-hassan-rouhani-iranian-jews.html\">blogged recently</a> as he hailed the new decision.</p> \n<p>Rouhani’s administration has tried to revamp Iran’s image, especially concerning the official attitude towards the country’s Jewish community, after it was badly tarnished under his predecessor, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who was notorious for his Holocaust denials and antisemitic tirades. </p> \n<p>Rouhani took Iran’s sole Jewish MP to New York with his entourage in his first visit to the UN general assembly. He has since condemned the mass killings of Jews by the Nazis as crime against humanity, tweeted a Rosh Hashanah blessing for Jewish new year, and honoured Iranian Jewish soldiers who lost their lives in the eight-year war against Iraq in the 1980s.</p> \n<p>Since his appointment, Younesi – who is a Muslim cleric – has visited synagogues and churches across the country. According to the reformist Shargh daily, he said after one of those visits in the city of Shiraz: “Iran belongs to all Iranians from any ethnic or religious groups and all of them have a right to live peacefully along other citizens.” He was also quoted as saying: “No one is allowed to suppress or infringe the rights of any minority groups. We all have equal rights.” <br /></p> \n<p>The government last year <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/10/world/middleeast/jewish-hospital-at-home-in-iran.html\">donated nearly half a million dollars</a> to Tehran’s Jewish hospital. But hardliners, who are strongly opposed to such conciliatory moves, have not remained quiet. Instead, they have held Holocaust denial cartoon competitions in the capital. <br /></p> \n<p>Iran is believed to have the largest Jewish population in the Middle East after Israel. But the country’s Jewish population slumped after the Islamic revolution, when many Iranian Jews emigrated to Israel or other countries. <br /></p> \n<p>In spite of animosity between Iran and Israel, Iranians are the least antisemitic people in the Middle East,<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-27438044\"> according to the latest poll by the US-based Anti-Defamation League</a> (ADL). However, although Iranian Jews are free to practise their faith like other minorities,<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2015/02/19/387265766/irans-jews-its-our-home-and-we-plan-to-stay\"> some report feeling like second-class</a> citizens. </p> \n<p>The situation of Zoroastrianism is much better. Iranians were Zoroastrians before Islam arrived in Iran and the country’s culture is a mixture of Islamic and Zoroastrian traditions. Many traditions survive from those ancient times, such as Nowruz, or Persian new year, which is a holy day for Zoroastrians but also the most important holiday for millions of Iranian Muslims. </p> \n<p>Amid improvements, one notable exception is the Baha’i faith, which is still banned and its followers persecuted and even imprisoned. </p> \n<p>Those in jail include Faran Hesami, a Bah&aacute;’&iacute; mother of a four-year-old, who was arrested for teaching members of the community in Iran who are banned from university because of their religious affiliation. Seven Bah&aacute;’&iacute; leaders have been imprisoned for the past seven years, each serving 20-year sentences.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3906312049307c06b455e1d7bc4913a82dd892d9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430843221512/8b3e7d37-0462-4a46-bf63-fc24a46035e8-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Faran Hesami embraces her son before returning to prison after a four-day leave this March.

Muslims who convert to other religions risk being arrested. More than 90 are behind bars, includuing pastor Saeed Abedini, who holds an Iranian American citizenship. Muslims whose denominations are not accepted by Iran, such as Gonabadi dervishes, face persecution, with many of their members in jail. <br /></p> \n<p>Rouhani is trying to improve the situation of ethnic groups. Earlier this year, Iran unveiled the first book in Kurdish language to be officially taught in schools in the country’s Kurdistan region. However, widespread persecution persists against Arab, Kurdish and Azeri activists. <br /></p> \n<p>In December 2013, in a rare example of a politician from a minority group being promoted in Shia-dominated Iran, a Sunni woman, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2013/dec/12/iranian-city-picks-first-female-minority-ethnic-mayor\">Samieh Baluchzehi</a>, who belongs to the country’s Baluchi ethnic minority, was chosen as the mayor of a provincial city.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/30/1430392684402/32eecf47-3077-4e0b-bce0-764a91b1e01d-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Erfan Khoshkhoo/ISNA","altText":"Andranik Teymourian, an Iranian Armenian, is the first Christian to lead Iran’s national football team as its permanent captain.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Erfan Khoshkhoo/ISNA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430843221363/76e5402e-43c4-471d-ade5-fde49f18f18a-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":459,"width":306,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Faran Hesami embraces her son before returning to prison after a four-day leave this March.
