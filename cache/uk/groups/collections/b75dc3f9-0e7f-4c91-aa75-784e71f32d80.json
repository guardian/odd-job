His call for a moral awakening of politicians and people of faith is a likely precursor to the highly anticipated encyclical on the environment, which was drafted by Turkson and which Pope Francis is expected to release in June.</p> \n<p>“In our recklessness, we are traversing some of the planet’s most fundamental natural boundaries,” warned Turkson. “And the lesson from the Garden of Eden still rings true today: pride, hubris, self-centredness are always perilous, indeed destructive. The very technology that has brought great reward is now poised to bring great ruin.” </p> \n<p>Ban Ki-moon, the United Nations secretary-general who delivered the keynote address at the summit, said he believed the pope’s encyclical – coupled with the pontiff’s planned speeches before the UN general assembly and a joint session of the US Congress – would have a profound impact on climate change negotiations.<br /></p> \n<p>“[The encyclical] will convey to the world that protecting our environment is an urgent moral imperative and a sacred duty for all people of faith and people of conscience,” Ban said.</p> \n<p>While he declined to comment on any details of the encyclical following his morning meeting with the Argentinean pontiff – the document has already been written and is being translated – he said he was counting on the pope’s “moral voice and moral leadership” to help accelerate talks.</p> \n<p>Pope Francis’s September address will be the first time any pope has spoken before a special session of the general assembly. </p> \n<p>Both Turkson and Ban emphasised that scientists and people of faith were united in their call for action.</p> \n<p>“Science and religion are not at odds on climate change. Indeed, they are fully aligned. Together, we must clearly communicate that the science of climate change is deep, sound and not in doubt,” Ban said.</p> \n<p>Turkson called on leaders of all faiths to be good role models. “Think of the positive message it would send for churches, mosques, synagogues, and temples all over the world to become carbon neutral,” he said. “At a time like this, the world is looking to faith leaders for guidance. This is why Pope Francis has chosen to issue an encyclical on protecting the environment at this unique moment in time.”</p> \n<p>The Protect the Earth, Dignify Humanity meeting has brought about a rare meeting of minds between scientists and religious officials on climate change, even if they frame their arguments in different ways.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://divinity.yale.edu/berger\">Teresa Berger</a>, a professor at the Yale Divinity School, said she believed the encyclical would have an overarching theological vision – one of “a God-sustained universe, anchored in a theology of creation as articulated in the biblical witness. And based on this, Pope Francis will probably not mince words, but note as evil, for example, the sin of exploiting the Earth.”</p> \n<p>Francis has already said he believes global warming is mostly manmade and that a Christian who does not protect God’s creation “is a Christian who does not care about the work of God”. He has also linked environmental exploitation to social and economic inequality, saying: “An economic system centred on the god of money needs to plunder nature to sustain the frenetic rhythm of consumption that is inherent to it.”</p> \n<p>Activists hope the summit and the encyclical will influence the next round of international negotiations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which will take place in Paris in November. The pope, whose foray into diplomacy helped <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/26/usa-cuba-relations-barack-obama-pope-francis-spies\">spur negotiations between the US and Cuba</a>, is expected to address the topic in a speech before the UN in New York in September.</p> \n<p>Some conservatives in the US, where the Republican party has fiercely resisted attempts to regulate greenhouse gases and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/mar/27/ted-cruz-climate-change-republicans-2016\">questioned the scientific consensus</a> on global warming, have criticised the pope for getting involved in the issue.</p> \n<p>“Francis sullies his office by using demagogic formulations to bully the populace into reflexive climate action with no more substantive guide than theologised propaganda,” Maureen Mullarkey wrote in <a href=\"http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/mullarkey/2015/01/francis-political-illusion\">First Things</a>, a conservative journal.</p> \n<p>Another conservative group, the Heartland Institute, which seeks to discredit established science on global warming, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/apr/24/heartland-institute-koch-pope-francis-lobbying-climate-change-global-warming\">held its own meeting in Rome on Monday</a> – and will hold a second on Tuesday – in which officials derided the pope for taking on the issue.</p> \n<p>“You demean the office that you hold and you demean the church whom it is your sworn duty to protect and defend and advance,” said Lord Christopher Monckton, a prominent climate sceptic and former policy adviser to the former British prime minister, Margaret Thatcher. Monckton’s opinions have been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2010/sep/21/climate-scientists-christopher-monckton\">refuted by scientists</a>, who have called his statements “very misleading” and “profoundly wrong”.</p> \n<p>The summit at the Vatican has been organised by the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and its stated goal is to help “elevate the importance of the moral dimensions of protecting the environment in advance of the papal encyclical and to build a global movement to deal with climate change and sustainable development”.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/03/climate-embeds/campaign-form/update/promos/campaign-embed-form.html\" data-alt=\"Guardian Keep it in the Ground petition\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2015/03/climate-embeds/campaign-form/update/promos/campaign-embed-form.html\">Guardian Keep it in the Ground petition</a> \n</figure>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430208386600/cec391c2-e0b5-4c91-84cc-a1d8e1248254-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"The sun sets behind St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican City.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-04-28T13:30:25Z","lastModified":"2015-04-28T13:30:30Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Stephanie Kirchgaessner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Climate change","Vatican","The papacy","Pope Francis","Italy","Environment","Catholicism","Religion","Christianity","Europe","World news","Ban Ki-moon"],"topics":[{"displayName":"Stephanie Kirchgaessner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stephanie-kirchgaessner"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"environment"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/apr/28/vatican-climate-change-summit-to-highlight-moral-duty-for-action","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/47qh2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/environment/2015/apr/28/vatican-climate-change-summit-to-highlight-moral-duty-for-action","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/28/vatican-climate-change-summit-to-highlight-moral-duty-for-action"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430224232076/d6a09cf4-cebc-4536-ac8e-b7f8c2abbac0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Pope Francis shakes hands with the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, during a meeting at the Vatican.

With negotiations with Greek Cypriots restarting soon, the change in Turkish Cypriot leadership raises the question one more time: can the Cyprus problem be resolved?</p> \n<p>The Republic of Cyprus became independent as a state of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in 1960. But after the failure of the two sides to cooperate and the conflict that culminated in the war of 1974, the island was divided into two zones: in the south the Republic of Cyprus, now exclusively led by Greek Cypriots, and in the north the self-declared Turkish Republic of northern Cyprus, which remains unrecognised and relies on the military, economic and political support of Turkey. Over the years, the two communities have unsuccessfully tried to reunify based on a federation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/27/mustafa-akinci-wins-northern-cyprus-presidential-election\">Mustafa Akinci wins northern Cyprus presidential election</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The new leftist leader Akinci supports the efforts for a new federal Cyprus, which is why he is regarded as a “moderate” on the Cyprus problem. At the other end of the political spectrum stand more “hardline” politicians, such as the defeated conservative Derviş Eroğlu, who are less flexible in negotiations and often gravitate more towards looser federal arrangement, a clearly separate Turkish Cypriot state and increased links with Turkey.</p> \n<p>Akinci is not new to compromise politics in Cyprus. During the 1980s, as mayor of the Turkish municipality of Nicosia, he worked with his Greek Cypriot counterpart to address a series of issues in the capital. Later, he founded the Peace and Democracy Movement to promote reunification based on the Annan plan, the UN proposal for a federation and consequent accession of a united Cyprus into the EU. The proposal was approved by Turkish Cypriots <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2004/apr/22/eu.cyprus\">but rejected by Greek Cypriots</a>, who entered the EU alone. When I met him a few years later, Akinci continued to see EU integration as a remedy to the Turkish Cypriots’ international isolation.</p> \n<p>Akinci’s desire for a solution is also reflected in his views on the relationship between Turkish Cypriots and Turkey. During the past few years Turkey’s involvement in north Cyprus has increased, not least in the form of promoting Islam through education and the construction of mosques. But unlike many Turkish Cypriot politicians, such as his predecessor Eroğlu, Akinci’s loyalties lie more with Cyprus than Turkey. During his campaign, he challenged Ankara’s role by saying that the relationship between north Cyprus and Turkey should be one of “brothers and sisters” rather than of “a motherland and her child”, which has been the mantra of Turkish governments and of the current prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who rebuffed Akinci’s remarks after his victory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/27/guardian-view-on-prospects-for-cyprus-settlement\">The Guardian view on the prospects for a Cyprus settlement | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The outcome of the election can be seen as a Turkish Cypriot message of reconciliation, but also as a reflection of unease with the involvement of Turkey in north Cyprus. The Cyprus problem and the role of Ankara took centre stage in the campaign, especially during the last week when the moderate Akinci and the hardliner Eroğlu fought for the second round. When it finally became obvious that Akinci had won the race, people took to the streets carrying flags of the EU rather than those of the self-declared Turkish Cypriot state or even of Turkey, which are more popular among hardliners. Some supporters of Akinci called Greek Cypriots to cross the border of the divided capital and join the celebrations. For a moment, the atmosphere was reminiscent of that of 2004, when Turkish Cypriots rallied behind reunification and EU accession.</p> \n<p>So what are the chances that the Cyprus problem will be resolved this time round? The experience of 2004 shows that whatever happens in northern Cyprus, Greek Cypriots also need convincing. But this is not to downplay the difference that Akinci’s victory could make. Akinci is a rather different leader, and he is expected to focus on the role of society in reconciliation rather than on just the official negotiations. That’s why he advocates the opening of the ghost town of Famagusta – a move that is viewed positively by many Greek Cypriots – which he thinks could bring economic benefits to both sides and create momentum towards a resolution.</p> \n<p>To what extent these confidence-building measures will bring a solution to the decades-long dispute closer remains to be seen. But, for now, one thing is certain: Akinci is the most reconciliation-minded leader his Greek Cypriot counterpart Nicos Anastasiades could have as a negotiating partner. Who knows? Maybe the fact they both come from Limassol could play a positive role too.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430223238674/Mustafa-Akinci-after-his--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mustafa Akinci after his election victory on Sunday.
