While Britain has joined the US and other nations in bombing Isis positions in Iraq, the west has so far refrained from taking military action against Isis in Libya.</p> \n<p>The Isis base where the gunmen are believed to have trained is near Sabratha, 40 miles west of Tripoli, at al-Ajaylat, a former military compound on the outskirts of the city. In recent months, the area has been engulfed in the country’s ongoing civil war and it is unclear if Isis is still in the area.</p> \n<p>Jihadist units from al-Ajaylat were blamed for the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jan/04/british-man-dead-libya-named-mark-de-salis\">cold-blooded killing of British oil worker Mark De Salis</a>, whose body was found on a nearby beach together with his New Zealand girlfriend, Lynn Howie, in January last year.

Late last year, the unit re-flagged itself as part of Isis.</p> \n<p>UK officials still believe only one gunman was responsible for the shootings in Sousse but some of the Marhaba survivors insist there was a second gunman present.</p> \n<p>Rezgui, who was shot by security forces outside the hotel, was clean shaven, but witness Tom Richards, from Cheshire, who came face-to-face with a gunman in the hotel, insists the man he saw had long hair and a prominent beard. Hotel staff and lifeguards said they remembered only a lone gunman on the beach itself.</p> \n<p>Moez Afra, who saved the life of a badly injured British man by dragging him across the sand to safety during the attack, said a single gunman had begun firing on the beach, then moved into the hotel before returning to the beach again.</p> \n<p>Afra and other beach staff on duty that day say they are unsure how Rezgui got to the beach; lifeguards on both sides of the hotel insist they did not see Rezgui pass. “We all know each other; we would have noticed a stranger,” said Afra.</p> \n<p>Daniel Ben Said, who supervises jetskis on the beach and used his motorboat to pluck a British man who had been wounded in the arm from the sea, scotched reports that Rezgui had reached the beach using a boat or jetski. “Not a jetski,” he said. “I would have seen it. I was right here.”</p> \n<p>The team of British police officers in Tunisia are concentrating on identifying the dead and on the repatriation of the bodies, which will begin on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>The British police investigation is officially limited to providing information for coroners who will hold a series of inquests into the deaths. </p> \n<p>All the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/30/scottish-couple-identified-victims-tunisian-attack\">wounded Britons have been repatriated</a>, including four severely injured people who were brought back by an RAF C-17 transport plane.

Our registration is the key thing for us. We haven’t heard much but we are all pushing and believe we will have it soon.”</p> \n<p>Lambda has 40-50 members and provides counselling, legal assistance and health advice. Registration would mean access to funding and tax exemption status, and would be a step towards acceptance for the country’s LGBT community. Mozambique has a reputation for more relaxed social attitudes than <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/feb/23/africa-homophobia-uganda-anti-gay-law\">many countries in Africa</a>.</p> \n<p>Capitine added: “We are quite a tolerant people. The LGBT community is not targeted by violent acts as in some African countries. But we do face discrimination here, for example when parents say you cannot live here until you change.”</p> \n<p>Public displays of same-sex affection are rare but not unknown. “It will depend where you’re going, how you act in general. Some people are more open, some are more shy. It depends where you are and who you are with.”</p> \n<p>The mainstream media tend to ignore the subject but the internet has provided a platform for raising awareness. <a href=\"http://www.olhodocidadao.org/\">Dercio Tsandzana</a>, a leading activist and blogger in Mozambique, said: “In newspapers you can’t find it, in local media they don’t talk about it, but you can go to Facebook and find Lambda: ‘Look for us, we exist.’”</p> \n<p>He added: “We can’t say the government is open-minded. It is one thing to open laws, another to give recognition to an organisation like Lambda. They don’t say ‘We don’t accept’, but they don’t say ‘We accept’. This is about more than laws. It’s not easy but we have to talk.”</p> \n<p>Joaquim Chissano, a former Mozambican president, appealed for a change in attitudes in <a href=\"http://www.theafricareport.com/Soapbox/an-open-letter-to-africas-leaders-joaquim-chissano-former-president-of-mozambique.html\">an open letter to African leaders</a> last year. “We can no longer afford to discriminate against people on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity, migrant status, sexual orientation and gender identity, or any other basis – we need to unleash the full potential of everyone,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>“As an African who has been around a long time, I understand the resistance to these ideas. But I can also step back and see that the larger course of human history, especially of the past century or so, is one of expanding human rights and freedoms.”</p> \n<p>Same-sex relations are illegal in 36 of the continent’s 54 countries, according to Amnesty International, and punishable by death in Sudan, Nigeria and Mauritania. <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3144219/Robert-Mugabe-proposes-Barack-Obama-Zimbabwe-s-leader-says-travel-White-House-one-knee-ask-hand-mocks-legalisation-gay-marriage.html\">Anti-gay statements</a> from political leaders are common in Mozambique’s neighbours Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p> \n<p>But LGBT organisations have recently scored legal victories allowing them to register in Botswana and Kenya, and last year the African Commission on Human and Peoples’ Rights <a href=\"http://www.advocate.com/world/2014/06/02/african-commission-human-rights-passes-lgbt-resolution \">passed a resolution</a> calling on national leaders on the continent to respect the human rights and dignity of LGBT people. </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.hrw.org/about/people/graeme-reid\">Graeme Reid</a>, director of the LGBT rights programme at Human Rights Watch, said: “We’ve seen small incremental steps towards greater equality in sub-Saharan Africa. If you look at the overall picture of the last 25 years and look at the strength and resilience of LGBT movements, that’s a positive sign. In some ways, the homophobia we see is a reaction against this increased visibility.”</p> \n<p>He added: “It’s difficult to talk about an overall pattern but we have seen some positive developments over the last 18 months.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/petertatchell\">Peter Tatchell</a>, a veteran human rights and gay rights campaigner, said of the Mozambique law: “It’s a wonderful development amid the often regressive anti-gay measures being taken by some other African countries like Nigeria, Cameroon, Uganda and the Gambia.</p> \n<p>“The decriminalisation is the result of long patient lobbying by Mozambican LGBT activists and their African allies. This is the first step towards wider legal protection for LGBT people in Mozambique and for LGBT organisations to receive formal recognition and consultative status with government.”</p> \n<p>He added: “The pattern across Africa is very uneven. <a href=\"http://www.southafrica.info/services/rights/same-sex-marriage.htm#.VZLCgmSUeXM\">South Africa leads the way</a>. Mozambique has taken a first step in the same direction but most other African countries still criminalise same-sex relations and often ignore homophobic, biphobic and transphobic violence. LGBT human rights defenders in most African countries are at constant risk of arrest and of mob violence.”<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688962238/28cf3d82-1e6d-4bbb-bc5a-a5381e8da27d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lucy Nicholson/Reuters","altText":"Rainbow flag","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T18:32:36Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T00:13:32Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":13,"contributors":[{"name":"David Smith","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/davidsmith"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Mozambique","LGBT rights","Africa","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/mozambique","webTitle":"Mozambique"},{"id":"world/lgbt-rights","webTitle":"LGBT rights"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"David Smith","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/davidsmith"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/30/mozambique-lgbt-activists-anti-gay-law-scrapped","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9cn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/30/mozambique-lgbt-activists-anti-gay-law-scrapped","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/30/mozambique-lgbt-activists-anti-gay-law-scrapped"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435688962238/28cf3d82-1e6d-4bbb-bc5a-a5381e8da27d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lambda’s Carina Capitine: ‘The LGBT community is not targeted by violent acts as in some African countries.

What makes this even more unbelievable, and unfortunate, was that the mistakes took place even though there were three pilots in the cockpit,” said one of the sources, who declined to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the topic.</p> \n<p>“That is why the focus of the investigation has been narrowed to the pilots and pilot training at TransAsia,” the source added.</p> \n<p>Since the crash, Taiwan’s Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) has put all 55 of TransAsia’s ATR pilots through oral proficiency tests on how to handle an aircraft during engine failure.</p> \n<p>All but one of the pilots passed the tests, although some needed more than one attempt. The lone failure was demoted in rank to vice-captain from captain.</p> \n<p>“It was difficult to believe the captain turned off the wrong engine, but it happened anyway. That’s why tests were demanded of TransAsia’s ATR pilots,” said another source, who also requested anonymity.</p> \n<p>A third source said TransAsia, in addition to cancelling some flights, had made a number of reforms since the crash to boost safety measures.</p> \n<p>These included inviting Jon Beatty, chief executive of the US-based non-profit Flight Safety Foundation, to bring his team to Taiwan shortly after the crash.</p> \n<p>TransAsia also set up an internal flight safety panel, which included Beatty, to report to its board, the source said.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a525009b100bd82f85d5b994da5347a74a4090cc/0_0_2996_1799/2996.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":2996,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tvbs Taiwan/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"This screen grab, courtesy of TVBS Taiwan, shows a TransAsia ATR 72-600 turboprop plane clipping an elevated motorway.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tvbs Taiwan/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d683a892abd2214e55f1e128f284c1e2cd6da3e2/0_0_4422_3036/4422.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3036,"width":4422,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rescue personnel search for passengers from the wreckage of a TransAsia ATR 72-600 turboprop plane that crash-landed into the Keelung river outside Taiwan’s capital Taipei.

They declined to discuss the cause of the fire, saying it was under investigation.</p> \n<p> Amber Pangborn of Oroville, California, told television station KCRA that after realizing she might be going into labor, she drove along a back road to get to her parents’ home for help only to get lost in a remote part of the Plumas National Forest.</p> \n<p> “There was no cellphone service, there was nothing. And the car was out of gas,” Pangborn told the station.</p> \n<p> Alone, Pangborn gave birth early on Thursday. She and her newborn child, whom she named Marissa, were then stranded without any provisions except for three apples, a bottle of water and a can of soda, Pangborn told KCRA.</p> \n<p> She told the station that, desperate to get help, she started a fire on Saturday in the hope of attracting attention, and the flames quickly grew.</p> \n<p> “The fire just went whoosh and shot up the mountainside. And I was looking at Marissa … and I was like, ‘I think mommy just started a forest fire,’” Pangborn told the local TV station.</p> \n<p> A US Forest Service helicopter crew responding to the fire spotted the car containing the mother and newborn, and sent a fire truck which took the pair to another location, said a Plumas National Forest spokesman, Jeremy Croft.</p> \n<p> The fire grew to a quarter acre (1,000 sq meters) and was extinguished without any injury to firefighters, the Forest Service said in a statement.</p> \n<p> “Our thoughts and best wishes continue to be with the mother and baby,” Chris French, forest supervisor for Plumas National Forest, said in a statement.</p> \n<p> Pangborn’s mother, Dianna Williams, told KCRA that she was elated her daughter and granddaughter were safe.</p> \n<p> “The baby’s beautiful and everything’s wonderful,” Williams told the station.</p> \n<p> A spokeswoman for Oroville hospital, where Pangborn was taken for treatment, said she had been discharged and declined to release any further details.
