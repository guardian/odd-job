Born in June of 2013, photos and videos of Alex appeared across the global media, including the BBC, National Geographic and <a href=\"http://news.mongabay.com/2014/0701-hance-desbiez-interview.html\">Mongabay</a>. From Alex and his mother, Isabelle, researchers learned that giant armadillos are far more parental and familial than long believed. <br /></p> \n<p>Two weeks ago, researchers found Alex dead. </p> \n<p>“I was truly very sad,” said Arnaud Desbiez, the head of the <a href=\"http://giantarmadillo.org.br/\">Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project</a>, the first long-term study ever of these mysterious animals. “[Alex] was mortally wounded by a predator most likely a puma and died inside one of his mother’s old burrows. “</p> \n<p>Desbiez and his team became worried when photos from a camera trap outside the burrow showed that Alex had not left it for several days. Ominously, one of the photos caught a vulture peering into the burrow. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f7d2a5553a5ccf06390543e06c9dd1b2d1af966\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435351920574/d2d1ed3a-a8bc-4d36-9825-65b34ee02550-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Research on Alex proved that giant armadillos may even be playful.

Here Alex attempts to climb on his mother, Isabelle.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“My heart sank as I saw that picture,” said Desbiez. “I went to smell the entrance of the burrow. I was devastated. I smelled a faint smell of rot instead of the sweet, strong acrid smell of a giant armadillo. I could not believe this was happening. I was in total shock.”</p> \n<p>The next day the team dug out the burrow. Inside they found Alex’s body. From a necropsy, the team believes that Alex was attacked by a puma.</p> \n<p>“He managed to escape the predator, but suffered a deep wound between the shoulder blades. Too weak he sought refuge in an old burrow and did not have the strength to even dig,” said Desbiez. “He died inside the burrow after agonising for two days.”</p> \n<p>For most of history, giant armadillos (<em>Priodontes maximus</em>) have been almost more myth than reality. The only member of the genus <em>Priodontes</em>, the world’s largest armadillos are massive and undeniably impressive. They can weigh more than 30 kilograms, grow longer than 1.5 meters and sport six-inch claws that make a velociraptor’s look diminutive. But as one of the most cryptic mammals in South America, scientists knew next to nothing about them. </p> \n<p>Desbiez’s project – for which he recently won a prestigious <a href=\"http://whitleyaward.org/\">Whitley Awards </a>presented by David Attenborough – has changed all of that. </p> \n<h2>Alex’s contribution to science<br /></h2> \n<p>It’s safe to say that scientists have learned more about giant armadillos from Alex and Isabelle than any other individuals before. Their relationship demolished previous ideas of giant armadillo behaviour. Researchers thought young giant armadillos might spend six weeks with their mother. But Alex lived in burrows with his mother for more than a year, and even at the time of his death remained close to her. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhuk3tfn_x8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vhuk3tfn_x8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Video of Desbiez’s work for the Whitley Award. Narrated by David Attenborough.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Alex was still living in his mother’s territory and although for the past five months he was digging his own burrows he showed no signs of getting ready to disperse,” said Desbiez.</p> \n<p>In addition, at almost two Alex was not yet sexually mature. </p> \n<p>“Many questions still remain,” said Desibiez. “How long would he have stayed with his mother? When was his mother going to have her next baby? When was Alex going to reach sexual maturity?” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd94df5aa52f8833e6bf05cbde275339ccf3964e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435351696833/5fc604da-7b5f-4dbc-8bc1-ea4aec5c55ed-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Giant armadillos are frequently killed by cars, a growing problem for many species in Brazil. \" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giant armadillos are frequently killed by cars, a growing problem for many species in Brazil.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>All these questions take on massive importance because they are key to determining how quickly giant armadillos reproduce and, subsequently, how endangered they might be. Currently, the IUCN Red List considers giant armadillos as Vulnerable, which is partially based on the idea that giant armadillo generations last seven years. </p> \n<p>But Alex’s death reiterates just how fragile giant armadillo lives can be, despite their heavily-armoured bodies. Before Alex, Isabelle had another baby – also documented by the team – but this infant was quickly killed by a male giant armadillo (later named Hannibal) looking to mate.</p> \n<p>“This is the second birth we have followed. Both ended tragically,” said Desbiez who added that through these mortalities “we realise once again how hard it is for these rare ancient creatures to survive.”</p> \n<p>Although it survives in many environments across South America – the Pantanal, the Amazon and the Cerrado – giant armadillos are naturally rare. They also face a rising tide of threats. People kill giant armadillos for food, for their claws and, at least in the Pantanal, because the species is believed to bring bad luck. Giant armadillos are also increasingly run over by cars on expanding road networks. And, of course, the species suffers from the widespread habitat loss and deforestation that imperils many other animals worldwide. <br /></p> \n<p>Finally, according to Desbiez, the giant armadillo is imperilled by ignorance. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>“Why shouldn’t we get attached to our subjects?”</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Arnaud Desbiez</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“The general public does not know this species exists or when shown a picture believe it is already extinct,” he said. “This should be considered a threat as the species [could] go extinct without anybody caring.”</p> \n<p>Given how cryptic and elusive the species is, there are currently no real estimates of how many giant armadillos remain on the planet. Still, scientists believe the population has probably fallen by at least 30% in the last 25 years – and continues to decline. </p> \n<p>Desbiez said people could help the species by <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/projetotatucanastra\">spreading the word about giant armadillos</a> and even visiting the project’s<a href=\"http://www.baiadaspedras.com.br/\"> research site</a> in the Pantanal. The project doesn’t just focus on giant armadillos, but also the southern naked-tailed armadillo, both the six-banded and nine-banded armadillo, the southern tamandua and the other giant in the Xenartha Order – made up of armadillos, sloths and anteaters – the giant anteater. <br /></p> \n<p>In its sixth year, the project has been largely <a href=\"http://giantarmadillo.org.br/en/project-partners/\">funded</a> by zoos across the world. Desbiez says the team’s wealth of data once again proves the importance of supporting long-term research on species. <br /></p> \n<h2>Science and attachments</h2> \n<p>“Why shouldn’t we get attached to our subjects?” Desbiez said when asked about his personal attachment to Alex.</p> \n<p>For a long time, biologists frowned on personal attachments to their subjects – and some still do. But then came Jane Goodall. The iconic primatologist shocked the scientific world not only with her findings, but by giving chimps names instead of numbers and treating them as individuals with distinct personalities. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84843ae9a5f3d4ea7bd893d99bb5eec58029de8e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435352416351/8a82920a-9bf8-40cc-b5b3-5f21948fedab-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Relationships between giant armadillos are more intimate than imagined.

Very sad indeed,” said Desbiez. “It is these strong emotions and connection to our study animals that give us the drive and strength to work so hard on behalf of their conservation.”</p> \n<p>Embracing such personal attachments has become far more common among conservationists. For one thing, it is arguably more honest for researchers to admit personal attachments to their subjects rather than pretend such feelings don’t exist – when obviously they do. </p> \n<p>“[Field conservationists] work in difficult remote conditions, long hours, isolation, insect bites, intense heat, we have to overcome so many challenges. It is the emotional connection to the species, and yes sometimes individuals, that make all these sacrifices worth it on a day to day basis while in the field,” noted Desbeiz. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5917df570f62082885818845ee289814789ff899\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435353412655/e170e2c0-8ad9-4702-b536-003b3a0ec9de-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alex at six months.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alex at six months.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Desbiez and his team weren’t alone in feeling a bond with little Alex. Many supporters of the project became attached to him through the team’s routine updates from the field. </p> \n<p>“I am in tears,” wrote Karin Schwartz, a conservation biologist with George Mason University who has visited the project. “I have followed Alex’s story since his birth, enjoying those first pictures with such excitement and reading...with anticipation of the discoveries that [were] made from observing his development...Yet through these stories, we’re all the richer.”</p> \n<p>Danni Parks, Award Manager for Whitley Funds, called Alex a “ a great ambassador for the species,” noting that while this is a “small consolation” for the loss of Alex it is also “far reaching.”</p> \n<p>Although Alex’s death is a tough setback for the Pantanal Giant Armadillo Project, Desbiez said the work to illuminate the private lives of these little-known animals will continue. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBH6T8W8fHA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBH6T8W8fHA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  One of the last videos ever taken of Alex via camera trap. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“There are still so many questions we need to understand.”</p> \n<p>With the grant from the Whitley Awards, the project is now expanding from the Pantanal into Brazil’s Cerrado. A vast tropical savannah, the Cerrado is one of the most threatened ecosystems in South America due to industrialised agriculture. Specifically, the team will be focusing their efforts in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul. </p> \n<p>“Thanks to our communication efforts [giant armadillos] have been selected by the state as one of the mammal indicator species for the creation of protected areas,” said Desbiez. “A species few knew of five years ago will now be championing habitat conservation.” </p> \n<p>The fact that giant armadillo presence could mean the establishment of new parks in Brazil proves the success not only of the project’s research, but also of their relentless educational and community outreach. </p> \n<p>New parks to safeguard giant armadillos would also be a fitting testament to the power of one little armadillo that captured the imagination of people in Brazil and beyond. A celebration of Alex. Although his life was brief, his impact will not be. Hopefully. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b93c2d250b31225d88ba6435a13dd6ce5099befd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435353745805/55198e63-1bcf-42ba-9338-f23557f5579a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alex with dirt on his head coming out of the burrow.

The grandfather of five, from Lisburn in County Antrim, was not driving when the coach crashed into a motorway bridge. An assistant driver, Stephen Cardwell, was injured in the crash.</p> \n<p>Six teachers were on the coach, which was travelling to Cologne in Germany when it crashed into a bridge in Middelkerke, West Flanders, and came off the road. Photographs show it lying on its side with the front completely destroyed.</p> \n<p>One teacher is thought to have broken a collar bone in the accident, which happened at about 9.45am local time (8.45am BST).</p> \n<p>Speaking at a press conference on Sunday evening Middelkerke’s mayor Janna Rommel-Opstaele confirmed that one adult, believed to be the assistant driver, and two children were still in hospital. She said those in hospital would be monitored throughout the night and the parents of the children were at their bedsides.</p> \n<p>Middelkerke and Nieuwpoort sent 35 firefighters,10 police officers and 10 members of the civil defence force to the scene of the crash. Ten ambulances, three doctors, and three nurses were also at the scene, and a team of Red Cross volunteers was deployed to help the children in Middelkerke.</p> \n<p>Twenty-five children are already on their way home, while the remaining seven and the staff are expected to leave Belgium on a coach later on Sunday.</p> \n<p>The head of Brentwood school, Ian Davies, said: “All of the children managed to walk off the coach. One of the children had a head injury. He had a scan and they found a small brain bleed as part of his fractured skull.”<br /></p> \n<p>The coach is owned by Richmond Coaches of Ballinderry Road, Lisburn, in Northern Ireland. A company spokesman confirmed it employed only Northern Irish drivers. <br /></p> \n<p>He added that it was now trying to establish the identity of the driver and his assistant, adding: “Any incident involving a coach crash like this is clearly a tragedy.”</p> \n<p>The coach, which was carrying children and their teachers on a language trip, overturned on the A18/E40 motorway, which runs to the Channel ferry ports and Channel tunnel, trapping the passengers for a short period before they were rescued. Three pupils and two teachers were taken to hospital. Those who escaped injury were taken to a nearby swimming pool.</p> \n<p>The children are believed to be year seven and eight pupils from the private school, which takes day and boarding pupils. They were setting out on a four-day trip and had left the school at 4am on Sunday.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/belgium_bus_accident/giv-21277aeoCDnFL8L0I\" data-alt=\"The scene of the coach crash in Belgium\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/belgium_bus_accident/giv-21277aeoCDnFL8L0I\">The scene of the coach crash in Belgium</a> \n</figure> \n<p>A spokesman for the Foreign Office said it was working with the Belgian authorities to establish details of the incident. </p> \n<p>In a statement, the school said: “We have been informed that the driver was killed in the collision and his assistant has been severely injured.

Covington, the latest in a long line of rightwing sci-fi writers, has been linked to racist crimes in the past and this week called the massacre “a preview of coming attractions”.</p> \n<p>The racist manifesto and photos apparently posted by Roof makes mention of the Northwest Front, created by Covington, a former member of the American Nazi party who traveled to South Africa and Rhodesia in order to agitate for white power. In the accompanying photos, Roof wore patches with Rhodesian and apartheid-era South African flags on them.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"54e399e38a2939e04be4f6567a2ec520cff93f9b\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/54e399e38a2939e04be4f6567a2ec520cff93f9b/0_317_4288_2571/1000.jpg\" alt=\"dylann roof charleston manifesto\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A photograph posted to a website with the alleged manifesto of Dylann Roof shows the Charleston shooting suspect posing with a burning American flag.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Covington, if you believe his website, runs a growing enclave of white supremacists near Seattle called the Northwest Front. The non-profit group is reflected in a series of sci-fi novels, authored by Covington, about a dystopian future in which a white nation is the only answer to US economic and racial woes. </p> \n<p>American science fiction has long had a rightward tilt, from the contemporary strain of small-press sci-fi Tea Party fantasias swarming the Hugo Awards nominations all the way back to libertarian deity Ayn Rand. But Covington’s novels are a breed apart.<br /></p> \n<p>His followers see conspiracy in Covington’s connections to Roof. “And why did this young man have a flight jacket with flag patches from the old White ruled southern African countries, which is where HAC spent part of his early days in the Cause, hmmm,” wrote a commenter called Wingnut under a recent podcast on the Northwest website. “Wonder if they’ll ‘find’ a pile of NF-HAC stuff in this young man’s home? Then they can pull one of those ‘the devil made me do it’ numbers on HAC.”<br /></p> \n<p>Covington doesn’t advocate for randomized violence; he wants revolution, to the extent that he calls his followers “comrades” and lectures them on “the purpose of revolution” among other phrases more characteristic of the left than the right. While it was clear Roof knew about the Northwest Front and seemed familiar with it, Covington condemned Roof’s shooting on his Tuesday podcast because “it doesn’t work.”<br /></p> \n<p>“People, don’t do this shit, this flipping out with a gun lunacy,” he said. “No, this is not just ritual disclaimer, Harold trying to cover is ass, this is what Harold really thinks.”<br /></p> \n<p>The Roof killings are not the first time Covington’s name has come up in connection with an allegedly racist murder. Covington was part of a group of white supremacists in the 1970s who massacred black people at a rally in Greensboro (Covington didn’t kill anyone and wasn’t in attendance on the day of the violence). He was also at one time close with <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/crime/article640079.html\">Frazier Glenn Miller</a>, who is charged with killing a woman, a 69-year-old man and that man’s 14-year-old grandson near Jewish institutions last year.<br /></p> \n<p>Elizabeth Wheaton wrote about Covington in her book Codename Greenkil: The 1979 Greensboro Killings. “Covington was pretty much a minor player,” she told The Guardian. “He liked the Nazi image on the white power kinds of things, but he was kind of nerdy. Most of [the others] were country people or ex-military.”</p> \n<p>“For all of his lacks, he does not lack the ability to turn a phrase,” said Wheaton. “He’s very articulate in presenting his message.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cb75b57eab0ec97c0e80b54316b7ceb33ee45d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2cb75b57eab0ec97c0e80b54316b7ceb33ee45d8/0_51_3564_2137/1000.jpg\" alt=\"harold covington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Harold Covington praises the acquittal of six Klansmen and Nazis charged with the slaying of five communists in 1980.

That’s usually where newbies in the Movement end up leaving their first electronic footprint.”<br /></p> \n<p>Much of Covington’s influence on his followers comes from his novels, which are written in a style that reads like someone spilled a 50-gallon barrel of ethnic slurs all over a stack of early-draft Robert Heinlein novels. His choice of cultural icons dates his books considerably, even the recent ones, which are filled with up-to-the-minute references to Jane Fonda and Gilligan’s Island, but the author probably doesn’t care about these criticisms. The books are not primarily novels, anyway.<br /></p> \n<p>The Northwest novels “are not meant to be mere entertainment”, according to Covington’s website Northwest.org. “They are meant to be self-fulfilling prophecies. The author wishes to inspire the creation of a real Northwest American Republic, and his novels are filled with a great deal of sound practical advice about how to do it.”<br /></p> \n<p>There are five Northwest novels are all populated with similarly brave and heroic white men (“domestic terrorist-type dudes” in the words of Shane Ryan, the narrator of Covington’s A Distant Thunder), cruel, DW Griffith-style black people whose speech is written in dialect, and hand-wringing liberals who want nothing more than to stifle the right to free speech of (white) people who just want to secede from the US.<br /></p> \n<p>“As the NVA [Northwest Volunteer Army, Covington’s heroes] vise had slowly clamped down on the Northwest over the past five years, Capitol Hill had lost much of its left-wing cachet, as those artsy-fartsy habitués who were dusky of skin or sexually inverted either fled to more hospitable climes or got well and truly wasted, shot dead on the pavement by the NVA gunners,” Covington explains in 2004’s A Mighty Fortress.<br /></p> \n<p>Shane Ryan, hero of the purported oral-history-of-the-revolution volume A Distant Thunder, recalls the heroism of his white brothers and sisters up to and including teams “specialty snipers” who pick off interracial couples and, of course, Conrad Baumgarten, who “came all the way from Germany with his SS officer grandfather’s scoped ’98 Mauser to hunt Jews”. <br /></p> \n<h2><strong>The conservative ‘fringe’ in science fiction</strong></h2> \n<p>Covington comes from a long line of rightwing US fantasists, though most are far less extreme. Where film and literary fiction and visual art tend to trend left, American sci-fi has a definite rightward bent, from libertarian deity Heinlein (widely praised by both his ideological detractors and his fans) to Ayn Rand, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2013/feb/11/dc-comics-homophobic-writer-superman\">Orson Scott Card</a> and beyond. </p> \n<p>“Science fiction has always had a strain in it that has been conservative and libertarian and some combination of the two; that’s been kind of a prominent feature for a very long time,” said John Scalzi, president of the Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Writers of America. “That in itself isn’t particularly problematic. Some of the most iconic writers in science fiction and fantasy have been conservative to libertarian. There’s nothing inherently wrong with them or the stories they tell. But like any group of people there are going to be folks whose politics are fairly fringe, and whatever comes out of their fringe is going to be fringe as well.”</p> \n<p>Scalzi is currently the target of one of those fringe figures, the openly misogynist and racist sci-fi writer Vox Day whose <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/18/hugo-award-hijack-just-proves-progressives-right\">logrolling campaign</a> to include more white men and fewer women and minorities in the Hugo Awards has attracted ire across the political spectrum and from the current <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/apr/09/george-rr-martin-right-wing-broken-hugo-awards\">king of fantasy, George RR Martin.</a><br /></p> \n<p>There are also less fringey figures whose work has taken a sharp rightward turn. Dan Simmons, writer of the much-praised Hyperion Cantos, wrote a novel called Flashback that more or less explicitly blamed progressives for the coming collapse of civilization and featured an “Islamic caliphate” that swarmed across Europe. Tea Party politics infect the work of Simmons’ contemporary, Orson Scott Card, as well: Card’s 2009 novel Empire imagines a world in which a radical leftist army calling itself the Progressive Restoration takes over New York City and ignites a second civil war.<br /></p> \n<p>Scalzi said that it’s unwise to dismiss authors because of a single novel or late-career tendency toward the lunatic fringe, but that he’s seen a rightward shift in a baby-boomer sci-fi novelists in particular. “For some healthy slice of the baby boomers in general, 9/11 just caused a bend in their thinking and they’ve been thinking in a much more conservative and reactionary way,” he said.<br /></p> \n<h2><strong>Covington’s prophecy</strong></h2> \n<p>In an email exchange with the Guardian, Covington said he was urging followers not to talk about Roof until “all the facts were out”.<br /></p> \n<p>What did he mean by that? “I mean that a lot of times these things are not as advertised and people like you have a tendency to try to use us as props and aids to support the Official Version. Oklahoma City being a prime example; there is a compelling case to be made that was a government sting operation gone very wrong, but I long ago gave up any hope of ever getting anybody to listen; anything we say is simply shouted down or kicked aside, we are treated as cranks at best, and facts are never allowed to interfere with the Received Wisdom from on high. </p> \n<p>“For another example, I am well aware of the ideological orientation of the Guardian (I lived in the British Isles for a number of years [Covington spent time among skinheads in the UK – “a lot of them were great guys,” he said on a recent podcast]) and I understand that I have not a snowball’s chance in hell of getting our viewpoint represented honestly and fairly there.”<br /></p> \n<p>A few hours later, a new installment of his radio show went up on the Radio Free Northwest website, in which he did not advocate for violence, but did fantasize for a little while, saying that liberals were afraid of Charleston because it was “a preview of coming attractions”.<br /></p> \n<p>“They’ve been given a vision of a time in some imagined but possibly not too-far distant future when all of a sudden, on the street or in their office, or in some trendy fern bar, or Starbucks, or wine-and-cheese boutique on the Upper East Side or in San Francisco, they will look up, possibly from the laptop, where they are typing up their day’s quota of leftwing, liberal horseshit, and they will see a young white man like Dylann Roof standing in front of them with no steroid-pumped policemen in blue to protect their liberal candy asses from the consequences of years of their own behavior,” he said. “They will see in that young white man’s eyes, that he recognizes them. That he is now beyond deception or bullying or browbeating or Twitter-shaming or intimidation, that he knows them for what they are. And they will look down and see that he has something in his hand.”</p> \n<p><br /></p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d3aed5d23cbbe22c90a69939819f03fd15b4850c/37_0_1198_720/1198.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1198,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"YouTube","altText":"harold covington northwest front","cleanCredit":"Photograph: YouTube"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/54e399e38a2939e04be4f6567a2ec520cff93f9b/0_317_4288_2571/4288.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2571,"width":4288,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A photograph posted to a website with the alleged manifesto of Dylann Roof shows the Charleston shooting suspect posing with a burning American flag.
