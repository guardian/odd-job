Britain, which is exempted from the proposed new regime unless it decides to take part, has robustly rubbished the scheme and vowed it will have no truck with it. Prior to their publication, the home secretary, Theresa May, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/13/theresa-may-uk-eu-migrant-resettlement-scheme\">said the EU plans would make the migration crisis worse</a>.</p> \n<p>Frans Timmermans, the vice-president of the European commission, said the blueprint for a new immigration system in Europe would “prompt debate and attract criticism”.</p> \n<p>But he argued that May’s rejection was half-baked.</p> \n<p>“I have the highest regard for British intelligence,” he said. “But I’m not sure that Theresa May has read all the plans we have made. What will make the situation worse is doing nothing.”</p> \n<p>Inaction in the face of tragedy in the Mediterranean would destroy European credibility, he argued. “I wonder how anyone could maintain this could make the situation worse,” he said.</p> \n<p>Federica Mogherini, the EU’s foreign policy chief, echoed the reproach to the home secretary after May singled her out for criticism and said the migrants crossing the Mediterranean should be turned back.</p> \n<p>Under the Geneva conventions governing treatment of refugees, it was impossible to return those fleeing immediately, said Mogherini. “All the people we save at sea will not be turned back,” she said.</p> \n<p> In reference to May’s comments, Mogherini said: “I believe there’s been a little bit of misinterpretation. I don’t know if intentional, probably not.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456711548__\n</div> \n<p>Amid a battery of policy moves on migration, many of them entailing a reinforcement of “Fortress Europe” measures to make it more difficult for economic migrants to enter the EU from north and sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, the commission proposed three big shifts on European refugee-sharing and quotas which, if realised, would constitute the beginnings of a coherent European policy on immigration.</p> \n<p>One short-term measure was to share 20,000 migrants who have not made the Mediterranean crossing and have been identified by the UN refugee agency as qualifying for protection. This would be funded by €50m (&pound;36m), with Brussels effectively paying countries to take in migrants according to a distribution key based on population size, national wealth, numbers of asylum seekers already present, and unemployment levels. If Britain participated, it would be allocated 2,309 of the 20,000.</p> \n<p>The second short-term measure, the details of which follow in a fortnight, would compel the rest of the EU to help relieve the flood of migrants into Italy and Greece. No figures for redistribution have yet been agreed.</p> \n<p>The longer term and more fundamental policy shift was to propose a permanent system for refugee redistribution whenever there is a “mass influx” into Europe. There is not yet any definition of what constitutes a mass influx and again no figures were mentioned.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/13/theresa-may-uk-eu-migrant-resettlement-scheme\">Theresa May: UK will not participate in EU migrant resettlement proposals</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The commission proposals will need to be backed by the EU’s national governments by a qualified majority, which already appears assured. Germany is a strong supporter of the plans, not least because under the general quota calculations it would see its share of asylum seekers roughly halved, from more than a third of the EU total at the moment to just over 18%.</p> \n<p>Britain, Ireland, and Denmark enjoy special exemptions on justice and home affairs policies in the EU, including asylum matters, and do not need to take part. Before seeing the detail of the legislation that will need to be tabled, the British Home Office has already flatly refused to be involved.</p> \n<p>The UK’s exclusion from the proposed new regime will have an impact on British immigration policy in ways that are not yet clear. For example, Timmermans said that to turn the proposals into a new system “we are going to have to revisit Dublin III. We are indeed going to have to revisit the system.”</p> \n<p>The EU’s Dublin regulation stipulates that an asylum seeker has to lodge the claim in the first EU country he or she enters and that if the claimant applies elsewhere, he or she can be deported to the first country of entry. Britain takes part in this system and uses it to deport asylum seekers who arrived in the UK via another EU country. If the Dublin rules are changed to facilitate the new system, it is not clear whether Britain would be able to opt in to one part while opting out of the bigger element.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536642144/d1631144-0052-4e85-8686-7803d40dcbda-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PAO/Mittelmeer / HANDOUT/EPA","altText":"German soldiers on the frigate Hessen rescue shipwrecked people from the Mediterranean off the Italian island of Lampedusa.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PAO/Mittelmeer / HANDOUT/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T17:07:18Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T23:33:43Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1466,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Traynor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iantraynor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Theresa May","Immigration and asylum","European Union","Politics","UK news","Europe"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/theresamay","webTitle":"Theresa May"},{"id":"uk/immigration","webTitle":"Immigration and asylum"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian Traynor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/iantraynor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-456711548","source":"ITN","durationInSeconds":147,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/13/140613theresamay2_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/13/140613theresamay2.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/13/1431517469648/KP_222374_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Theresa May: criminals profiting from migrants must be stopped - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Theresa May: criminals profiting from migrants must be stopped - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Theresa May: criminals profiting from migrants must be stopped - video"}}],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/13/theresa-may-receives-eu-rebuke-over-refugee-plan-criticism","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48pnn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/13/theresa-may-receives-eu-rebuke-over-refugee-plan-criticism","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/13/theresa-may-receives-eu-rebuke-over-refugee-plan-criticism"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431536642144/d1631144-0052-4e85-8686-7803d40dcbda-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"German soldiers from the frigate Hessen rescue shipwrecked people from the Mediterranean off the Italian island of Lampedusa.

Our natural instinct was to go towards them, to shield them, because we saw the police were being quite pushy,” Golubovska told the Guardian. “The riot police in full equipment were suddenly across the parliament building, ready to meet us.”</p> \n<p>Trapped against the shields and unable to get closer to the government buildings, Golubovska was at the front for two hours without moving. “I was talking to the policeman, saying gently to him that he should join us, that he didn’t have to follow orders, his duty was to the people and the constitution,” she said.</p> \n<p>“I told him my father was a retired police officer, I told him that I understood how hard it was for him. And then I asked if I could draw a heart on his shield, but he didn’t like that at all.”</p> \n<p>With the lipstick in her hand, she asked if she could use his shield as a mirror. “And then I very quickly kissed the shield,” she said. “He didn’t move but I did see him smile, very slightly.”</p> \n<p>Allegations over Neskovski’s death have emerged from the latest in a series of leaks from a treasure trove of wiretaps obtained by the Social Democrat opposition leader, Zoran Zaev, who claims he was given them by a whistleblower. </p> \n<p>It was reported this week that Macedonia’s interior minister was allegedly among those who conspired to cover-up the killing, at a rally Neskovski attended in support of the prime minister.</p> \n<p>It is alleged that the government has wiretapped more than 20,000 people ranging from the media and judiciary to police and diplomats. The government denies the allegations. </p> \n<p>“We have been protesting for a long time, calling for the government to resign en masse, but [the revelations about] Neskovski was a particularly strong emotion for a lot of people, we have demonstrated every year since he died,” Golubovska said. “The government have been lying to the people from their own mouths and through the media – for so many years, blatantly lying.”</p> \n<p>More mass protests in the capital are being organised for this Sunday, to demand the resignation of the prime minister, Nikola Gruevski, and to call for the release of two student leaders currently in detention.<br /></p> \n<p>“It is our civic duty and we won’t stop until we have a new interim government to appoint new unpartisan judges and prosecutors, until new elections,” she said.</p> \n<p>Golubovska said she had been inundated with messages from Macedonians saying her picture had inspired them to come out to protest. “That is most important to me, they said that they know now they should not be afraid,” she said. “But, yes, it is a little bit strange for me,” she added.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431535571476/7a43eb44-a2ca-4388-ae0e-18aa7451a375-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ognen Teofilovski/Reuters","altText":"Skopje protests","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ognen Teofilovski/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T16:57:22Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T17:00:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":169,"contributors":[{"name":"Jessica Elgot","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jessica-elgot"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Macedonia","Protest","World news","Europe"],"tags":[{"id":"world/macedonia","webTitle":"Macedonia"},{"id":"world/protest","webTitle":"Protest"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jessica Elgot","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jessica-elgot"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/13/macedonia-lipstick-protester-jasmina-golubovska","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48p96","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/13/macedonia-lipstick-protester-jasmina-golubovska","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/13/macedonia-lipstick-protester-jasmina-golubovska"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431535571476/7a43eb44-a2ca-4388-ae0e-18aa7451a375-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A woman kisses the shield of a police officer in front of the Macedonian government building in Skopje.

In addition to the seven confirmed dead in the crash on Tuesday night, more than 200 were injured.</p> \n<p>The speed limit on the curve where the train crashed is 50mph. Michael Nutter, the Philadelphia mayor, said the train’s apparent 106mph speed as it approached was “just insane” and “astounding, devastating”. </p> \n<p>On Wednesday night the driver was named in media reports as Brandon Bostian, said to be aged 32. The Reuters news agency, quoting a city official on condition of anonymity, described Bostian as a University of Missouri graduate with a business degree who had been an Amtrak engineer for more than four years and a conductor prior to that. The engineer was among those hurt in the wreck.</p> \n<p>ABC News reported Bostian’s lawyer as saying his client had no memory of the crash itself and “no explanation” for what happened, but was co-operating with authorities and had voluntarily turned over a blood sample and his cellphone.</p> \n<p>Bostian recalled driving the train to the area of the crash generally, then later getting tossed around, regaining consciousness and finding his bag and cellphone before dialing 911, the lawyer told the network.<br /></p> \n<p>ABC quoted the attorney as saying Bostian had “no health issues to speak of” before the wreck and was not on any medications. The engineer sustained a concussion and a gash to his head that required 14 staples, the lawyer told ABC. Bostian was treated for his injuries at Einstein Medical Center and released, a hospital spokesman said.</p> \n<p>NTSB board member Robert Sumwalt said investigators planned to interview the engineer after a day or two, once he had had time for convalesce.</p> \n<p>Sumwalt said data from the “black box” recorder would be analyzed, along with video footage from forward-facing cameras attached to the train, as well as myriad other aspects including the condition of the tracks and signaling equipment, and the training and performance of the five-person crew.</p> \n<p>The crash seemed likely to heighten moves to expand a system known as positive train control, or PTC, designed to prevent high-speed derailments. No such system was in effect at the site of the Amtrak crash, officials said.</p> \n<p>“We feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track, this accident would not have occurred,” Sumwalt said.</p> \n<p>Positive train control automatically slows or even halts trains moving too fast or heading into a danger zone. Under current law the rail industry must adopt the technology by year-end. </p> \n<h2>‘A lot of folks got banged up’</h2> \n<p>The city should have been a pass-through for most passengers aboard the Amtrak Northeast Regional Service train 188 between Washington DC and New York city. <br /></p> \n<p>Yet the trip, made by about 22 Amtrak trains on a normal day, ended up sending 136 patients to hospitals in the region, including dozens to Temple University hospital, where Dr Herbert E Cushing is chief medical officer.</p> \n<p>“There are a lot of folks that got banged up when they rattled around,” Cushing said of patients tossed inside train cars who came to Temple, a level one trauma centre.</p> \n<p>Late on Wednesday 23 patients in mostly stable condition remained at Temple. Eight patients were in critical condition, three awaited surgeries that evening and most had left the hospital after treatment. Two patients were sent home on Wednesday morning.</p> \n<p>The scant “good news” in the aftermath of the crash was the relative lack of head injuries, according to Cushing. </p> \n<p>As of Wednesday afternoon the hospital was only beginning to restabilise from the deadly derailment. The crush of ambulances carrying train crash victims had ended hours earlier. </p> \n<p>Most media moved from one press conference to the next in swarms, while some reporters remained stationed near the wreckage.</p> \n<p>Outside the hospital a worker told the Guardian she was “proud of her team,” but declined to identify herself as she was not authorised to speak to media. <br /></p> \n<p>Most hospital workers, who ate lunch or smoked outside the hospital, avoided journalists.</p> \n<p>Many of the patients at Temple University were not from Philadelphia, and some had even come from outside the US. Patients from Albania, Belgium, Germany, India and Spain were brought to Temple, Cushing said.</p> \n<p>Four Amtrak officials were stationed at the hospital to help victims from outside Philadelphia figure out a way to get home.</p> \n<p>One patient, suffering massive chest injuries from the crash, died at the hospital. James Marshall Gaines III, a 48-year-old from Princeton, New Jersey, is one passenger who has been named.

He added that there may be a process that will allow for votes on “several different proposals”.</p> \n<p>Kentucky Republican Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, has <a href=\"http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/mcconnell-introduces-bill-to-reauthorize-patriot-act-until-2020-20150421\">introduced legislation</a> with Richard Burr, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, that would extend the existing language of the Patriot Act through 2020. A spokesman for McConnell said the plan in the Senate is still to bring up that bill, despite bipartisan opposition to it, and open the floor to amendments.</p> \n<p>Connecticut senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat who has proposed several reforms to the Fisa court, argued that the House vote makes McConnell’s position “untenable”.</p> \n<p>“He’s really in a box,” Blumenthal told reporters on Wednesday. “I don’t know what his strategy is. I think he should sit down with supporters of the USA Freedom Act and reach a compromise that preserves constitutional rights and at the same time protects security.”</p> \n<p>In the House of Representatives, most Republicans, including hawks on the intelligence committee, were emphatic that the USA Freedom Act represented the best chance to preserve more targeted NSA surveillance powers.</p> \n<p>“America’s liberty and America’s security can coexist,” said judiciary chair Bob Goodlatte in the debate leading up to Wednesday’s vote. “They are not mutually exclusive.”</p> \n<p>Jim Sensenbrenner, an author of the original Patriot Act and lead sponsor of the USA Freedom Act reforms, argued they were the best possible compromise between the wishes of “national security hawks and civil libertarians” and accused the bill’s opponents of “fear-mongering”.<br /></p> \n<p>“I don’t fault my colleagues who wish this bill went further to protect our civil liberties. For years the government has violated the privacy of innocent Americans, and I share your anger,” he said. “But letting Section 215 and other surveillance authorities expire would not only threaten our national security, it would also mean less privacy protections.”</p> \n<p>Congressional staff involved in refining the USA Freedom Act since it last <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/may/22/nsa-reform-bill-usa-freedom-act-passes-house\">passed the House by 303 votes to 121 in May 2014</a> believe various revisions since have made the bill palatable enough to security hawks in the Senate, though expect possible amendments in the days ahead.</p> \n<p>“With the passage of this bill, the House will have done its part to enact historic and sweeping reforms,” said John Conyers of Michigan, the leading Democrat behind the bill.</p> \n<p>“Today we have a rare opportunity to restore a measure of restraint to surveillance programmes that have simply gone too far.”</p> \n<p>Yet several major civil libertarian groups, including the ACLU and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, abandoned support for a bill they consider an insufficient reform.</p> \n<p>Privacy advocates were emboldened last week by a federal appeals court’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/07/nsa-phone-records-program-illegal-court\">rejection</a> of the NSA’s bulk domestic phone records collection. They prefer a flat expiration of Section 215, a broad Patriot Act provision authorizing vast law enforcement powers to acquire business records, which will happen on 1 June absent explicit congressional revival. They note that the vast majority of bulk NSA surveillance, especially outside the United States, will be left untouched by the USA Freedom Act.</p> \n<p>“As a result of the Second Circuit decision, the USA Freedom Act’s modest changes appear even smaller compared to the now judicially recognized problems with the mass collection of Americans’ records,” the Electronic Frontier Foundation’s David Greene and Mark Jaycox <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/05/op-ed-why-the-eff-is-pulling-its-support-for-the-usa-freedom-act/\">wrote</a> in a Tuesday op-ed.</p> \n<p>NSA surveillance is the rare issue to scramble entrenched Senate partisan divides. McConnell’s key opponent on surveillance is his fellow Kentucky Republican, Rand Paul, who has made opposition to overly broad spying a central aspect of his bid for the party’s 2016 presidential nomination. Paul has vowed to filibuster McConnell’s bill, along with Oregon senator Ron Wyden, a Democrat who sits on the intelligence committee and has long criticised the mass surveillance.</p> \n<p>Wyden stood by the pledge on Wednesday, telling reporters he would block any effort “to just re-up the Patriot Act without reforms and the phone records collection program … just as it is”.</p> \n<p>“I consider it a federal human relations database,” Wyden said. “Millions and millions of phone records – when people call, often where they call from, who they call – is a lot of information.”</p> \n<p>Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat, said he was struck by how many Senate Republicans are committed to a straight re-authorisation – which he called a “non-starter”. He also pointed to the disconnect between Republican leaders in the House and Senate on the issue.</p> \n<p>“I think it’s astounding that House and Senate Republican leaders are running down separate parallel tracks this close to the deadline,” Murphy told the Guardian. </p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c486d204febfd3e6c9b77e6082f283fe51037073/0_0_3500_2101/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2101,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Larry Downing/Reuters","altText":"Cayman Macdonald, a member of the protest group Code Pink,  protests outside the U.S.  Department of Justice in Washington, in this January 17, 2014 file photo.

In the early hours of Thursday morning, armed forces chief general Prime Niyongabo, a supporter of the president, declared on state radio: “The coup attempt failed, loyal forces are still controlling all strategic points. The national defence force calls on the mutineers to give themselves up.”</p> \n<p>Then a spokesman for the anti-Nkurunziza camp, Burundi’s police commissioner Venon Ndabaneze, dismissed the claim and said Niyombare’s supporters were in control of many key points including Bujumbura’s international airport. “This message does not surprise us because the general has long been allied to the forces of evil and lies,” he told AFP.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78b2dc892f287374670ae1c0b05362ee6cfc4ef8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431592064062/345e85a1-949a-4566-b9e3-f8dc117996c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A anti-Nkurunziza's protester gestures in front of a burning barricade in Bujumbura.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A anti-Nkurunziza’s protester gestures in front of a burning barricade in Bujumbura.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: GORAN TOMASEVIC/REUTERS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A journalist inside the state TV and radio building said it came under attack after the loyalist broadcast, and that heavy weapons including cannon and rockets were being used.</p> \n<p>Private media were also caught up in the violence.

East African leaders attending the summit in Tanzania said in a joint communique: “The region will not accept nor stand by if violence does not stop or escalates in Burundi.”</p> \n<p>Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, chairperson of the African Union commission, said: “The chairperson condemns in the strongest terms today’s coup attempt in Bujumbura, calls for the return to constitutional order and urges all stakeholders to exercise utmost restraint.”</p> \n<p>The US urged Burundians to “lay down arms, end the violence and show restraint”, while the European Union which warned it was “essential the situation does not spin out of control”.</p> \n<p>UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon also made an urgent appeal for calm, while the security council said it would hold an emergency meeting on the situation on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Nkurunziza, a former rebel leader from the Hutu majority and born-again Christian, believes he ascended to the presidency in 2005 with divine backing.</p> \n<p>Opposition and rights groups insist that it is unconstitutional for Nkurunziza to run for more than two terms. The president, however, argues his first term did not count as he was elected by parliament, not directly by the people. This was supported by the constitutional court, although one of the judges fled the country, claiming its members were subject to death threats.</p> \n<p>More than 22 people have been killed and scores wounded since late April, when Burundi’s ruling CNDD-FDD party nominated Nkurunziza to stand for re-election in elections due on 26 June.</p> \n<p>More than 50,000 Burundians have fled the violence to Rwanda and other neighbouring nations in recent weeks, with the UN preparing for thousands more refugees.</p> \n<p>Dr Robert Besseling, principal Africa analyst at the London-based risk consultancy IHS, said: “While it is too early to confirm that the coup attempt has been successful, factional fighting between rival ethnic groups in the military and police is likely to erupt and increase the probability of a civil war. The highest risk of ethnic fighting over the next few days will be in Bujumbura, overpopulated rural areas and internally displaced people’s camps along the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Tanzanian borders.</p> \n<p>“The Imbonerakure, a youth militia affiliated to the CNDD-FDD, is likely to be deployed against ethnic Tutsi and to stage targeted political assassinations of Tutsi leaders and attacks on Tutsi groups.

George Ogilvie, the assistant special agent in charge of the agency’s Washington field office, had been placed on administrative leave, the agency said.</p> \n<p>Both men denied being drunk and told investigators they only had a few of the drinks over the course of the night. Ogilvie said some of the drinks on his tab, including five glasses of scotch, were given to other people at the bar, though he could not recall who received them.</p> \n<p>Secret Service director&nbsp;Joseph Clancy said on&nbsp;Wednesday he was “disappointed and disturbed at the apparent lack of judgment described in this report. Behavior of the type described in the report is unacceptable and will not be tolerated.”</p> \n<p>Roth’s report said Ogilvie was driving and Connolly was his passenger when Ogilvie drove his government-owned vehicle into the secured zone where on-duty Secret Service officials were investigating a suspicious package that had been left in the White House complex by a fleeing driver.</p> \n<p>Ogilvie “had to do considerable maneuvering” as he drove slowly through the area and pushed a larger construction barrier about five feet (1.5 meters) with the bumper of his vehicle. Clancy, who was not told about the incident for several days, previously told lawmakers that the agents “nudged” the barrier as they drove into the White House complex.</p> \n<p>Roth’s report said “this was no mere ‘bump’ but rather extended contact to shove the barrel out of the way”.</p> \n<p>The report said the pair also unwittingly drove within inches of the suspicious item as they made their way through the secured area.</p> \n<p>Roth said officers at the scene did not smell alcohol on either Ogilvie or Connolly&nbsp;but three officers thought something was “not right” about the pair. A watch commander was later told by an officer that “they may be drunk”.</p> \n<p>No field sobriety tests were given that night and both men were allowed to drive their government vehicles home from the White House.</p> \n<p>Roth concluded that both agents “displayed poor judgment and a lack of institutional awareness” and “more likely than not both Connolly and Ogilvie’s judgment was impaired by alcohol”.</p> \n<p>Roth also found that “it would have been far preferable” for the watch commander on duty that night to question the men further about their sobriety or ordered a field sobriety test.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/20/1429532715909/50aeef34-a4fa-4aeb-9ed2-8500cf2a081e-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS","altText":"white house fence","cleanCredit":"Photograph: KEVIN LAMARQUE/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T05:56:19Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T05:56:19Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Secret service","US news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/secret-service","webTitle":"Secret service"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/14/secret-service-agent-retires-after-alcohol-finding-in-white-house-car-crash","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48q7m","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/may/14/secret-service-agent-retires-after-alcohol-finding-in-white-house-car-crash","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/14/secret-service-agent-retires-after-alcohol-finding-in-white-house-car-crash"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/20/1429532715909/50aeef34-a4fa-4aeb-9ed2-8500cf2a081e-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"One Secret Service agent has retired and another is on leave after a report found alcohol was a factor in a car crash at the White House.
