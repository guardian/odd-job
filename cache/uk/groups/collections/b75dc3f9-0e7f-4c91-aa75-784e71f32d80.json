Mountain snowpack is at extremely low levels, and about one-fifth of the state’s rivers and streams are at record low levels.</p> \n<p>Eastern Washington has been experiencing temperatures into the 100s, and last week Washington governor Jay Inslee issued an emergency proclamation that allows state resources to quickly be brought in to respond to wildfires.</p> \n<p>Washington’s struggles with wildfires come as Alaska, its fellow Pacific Northwest state, is facing more and harsher wildfires this year.</p> \n<p>In Wenatchee, the wildfire fueled by high temperatures and strong winds roared into town Sunday afternoon. The blaze ignited in brush just outside Wenatchee, quickly burning out of control and leading about businesses about 120 miles east of Seattle to evacuate customers.</p> \n<p>Rainfall on Monday provided relief, but hot, dry conditions will challenge crews trying to get a handle on the flames that burned more than an estimated four square miles, officials said. Three firefighters suffered minor injuries, but no injuries to residents were reported.</p> \n<p>Albert Rookard, who lives across the Wenatchee River from the blaze, stayed up late watching the fire, and he was shocked at how fast it grew.</p> \n<p>“From here, we could see embers just flying,” Rookard said. “There was fire in so many places. We could see emergency vehicles flashing across town.”</p> \n<p>Evacuations were mainly in the north end of town and included a Walmart store, the Chelan County emergency management office said. The store did not burn, but several commercial buildings were near the blaze, Washington state patrol trooper Darren Wright said.</p> \n<p>Emergency management officials late Monday morning also briefly issued a “shelter in place” order after ammonia started leaking from a fruit warehouse. They later said it had dissipated and was no longer a threat.</p> \n<p>The Blue Bird warehouse, which uses ammonia for cold-storage, was among a few commercial buildings to burn.</p> \n<p>Bonny, who lives just outside Wenatchee, called the speed of the blaze “just mind-blowing”.</p> \n<p>“We’re fine now,” Bonny said. “Last night we watched the entire hill burn.”</p> \n<p>Phil Bentz, who lives on the same side of the river as the fire, said his home hadn’t been evacuated. “We were waiting for someone to knock on the door, but they didn’t come. So far, so good,” Bentz said.</p> \n<p>About noon Monday, fire trucks poured water on a burning warehouse in downtown Wenatchee, sending big black clouds into the air over the city. Farther north of town, scorched hillsides showed where the flames were stopped just short of irrigated apple orchards and residential subdivisions.</p> \n<p>Officials know the fire started in brush on the edge of town, but they are still trying to determine what sparked it. Sweltering heat above 100 degrees, tinder-dry brush and strong winds helped fuel it.</p> \n<p>Last month, Inslee declared a statewide drought emergency.</p> \n<p>State lands commissioner Peter Goldmark has banned all outdoor fires on state land protected by the Natural Resources department, and campfires have been banned at state parks and on state-controlled ocean beaches.</p> \n<p>Railroad traffic in the area has been shut down, including freight lines and Amtrak’s daily Chicago-to-Seattle route, BNSF Railway spokesman Gus Melonas said.</p> \n<p>The railroad helped battle the blaze by spraying water from tank cars and transferring water to firefighting trucks, he said.</p> \n<p>Hilda Emerson, 37, was among the people who fled the flames Sunday.</p> \n<p>“I went and grabbed what I could – my computers, irreplaceable stuff, toys for my daughter – and I left,” she said. “I never had to do this before.”</p> \n<p>She and her four-year-old daughter, Nissa, spent the night on cots set up by the Red Cross in the gymnasium of Eastmont high school in East Wenatchee. She planned to check on her home later in the day.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435621736990/63678192-ac9b-4ab8-bdce-fadf48d3baa9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Don Seabrook/AP","altText":"U.S. Forest Service firefighters from Leavenworth cut brush near houses in northern Wenatchee, Washington.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Don Seabrook/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T20:11:34Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T23:49:17Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":43,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Washington state","US news","Wildfires","Natural disasters and extreme weather"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/washington-state","webTitle":"Washington state"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/wildfires","webTitle":"Wildfires"},{"id":"world/natural-disasters","webTitle":"Natural disasters and extreme weather"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/29/washington-wildfires-wenatchee-disaster-drought","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a8gn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jun/29/washington-wildfires-wenatchee-disaster-drought","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/29/washington-wildfires-wenatchee-disaster-drought"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435621736990/63678192-ac9b-4ab8-bdce-fadf48d3baa9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"U.S. Forest Service firefighters from Leavenworth cut brush near houses in northern Wenatchee, Washington.

That would mean salaried employees earning less than $50,440 a year would be assured overtime if they worked more than 40 hours per week, up from the current $23,660 a year.</p> \n<p>“We’ve got to keep making sure hard work is rewarded,” Obama wrote in an article for the Huffington Post. “That’s how America should do business. In this country a hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay.”</p> \n<p>To keep up with future inflation and wage growth the proposal would peg the salary threshold at the 40th percentile of income, individuals familiar with the plan said. They requested anonymity in return for discussing the proposal ahead of the official announcement. The president has been scheduled to promote the proposal during a visit on Thursday to La Crosse, Wisconsin.</p> \n<p>Obama’s proposal aims to narrow a loophole that the president has long said some employers exploit to avoid paying overtime.</p> \n<p>Employees who make above the salary threshold can be denied overtime if they are deemed managers. Some work gruelling schedules at fast food chains and retail stores, but with no overtime eligibility their pay may be lower per hour than many workers they supervise.</p> \n<p>The existing salary cap, established in 2004 under George Bush, has been eroded by inflation and now relegates a family of four making just above the cap into poverty territory. Obama has long charged that the level is too low and undercuts the intent of the overtime law.</p> \n<p>The proposed changes will be open for public comment and could take months to finalize. They can be enacted through regulation, without approval by the Republican-led Congress.</p> \n<p>Although the labor department estimates the proposal would raise wages for five million people, other estimates are far higher. The Economic Policy Institute, a liberal thinktank, has said a threshold of $984 a week would cover 15 million people.</p> \n<p>“This is by definition middle-class people. This reverses decades of neglect,” said the EPI’s president, Larry Mishel, adding that the proposal would also likely create jobs for hourly workers.</p> \n<p>Under the current threshold only about 8% of salaried workers are eligible for 150% of their pay rate when they work overtime. The EPI estimates that doubling the salary level would make up to 40% of salaried workers eligible.</p> \n<p>Many Republicans have opposed Obama’s plans to increase the threshold, arguing that doing so would discourage companies from creating jobs and dampen economic growth. Senator Lamar Alexander, who chairs the Senate’s labor panel, has derided the idea as designed “to make it as unappealing as possible” for companies to create jobs.</p> \n<p>The US Chamber of Commerce said on Monday that Obama’s plan “will negatively impact small businesses and drastically limit employment opportunities. Additionally, many reclassified employees will lose benefits, flexibility, status and opportunities for advancement.”</p> \n<p>Obama, in the article, argued the original exemption had been intended for highly paid, white-collar employees but now punished lower-income workers because the government has failed to update the regulations. He said the proposal would be good not only for workers but also for employers who already paid their employees what they deserved, because they would no longer be undercut by competitors who paid less.<br /></p> \n<p>“Will we accept an economy where only a few of us do exceptionally well? Or will we push for an economy where every American who works hard can contribute to and benefit from our success?” Obama said, setting up a populist argument that Democrats are likely to embrace in the run up to the 2016 presidential election.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435638079838/b2bac4a7-323f-4792-98ff-aad9eeb61757-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media","altText":"'A hard day's work deserves a fair day's pay' – Barack Obama is to bring in regulations making many more people eligible for overtime.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Xinhua /Landov/Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T04:35:33Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T04:37:38Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":30,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Obama administration","US news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/obama-administration","webTitle":"Obama administration"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/30/barack-obama-moves-to-double-us-salary-limit-on-overtime-pay","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a8kt","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jun/30/barack-obama-moves-to-double-us-salary-limit-on-overtime-pay","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/30/barack-obama-moves-to-double-us-salary-limit-on-overtime-pay"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435638079838/b2bac4a7-323f-4792-98ff-aad9eeb61757-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘A hard day’s work deserves a fair day’s pay’ – Barack Obama is to bring in regulations making many more people eligible for overtime.
