It was very light, like paper, and water could get through,” says Sesay, sitting in the front room of her house, with her daughter, Tata, beside her.<br /></p> \n<p> Sesay contracted Ebola on 28 June last year. “One of my colleagues was infected and came here,” she says. “She was from the same village as me. I was taking care of her.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/apr/08/womens-organisations-fighting-ebola-funding-first-line-defence-liberia-guinea-sierra-leone\">Women's organisations fighting Ebola should be funded as a first-line defence</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“She had urine retention and was bleeding from all orifices and had diarrhoea. I tried to save her life. I passed the catheter, cleaned her and then gave her some water to drink. She vomited on my shoulder. I felt the vomit on my skin. That is when I caught Ebola.”</p> \n<p> Sesay reported the incident to the head nurse and was sent home to monitor herself. At the time, there was no quarantine programme in place. After a week, Fatmata felt as if her skin was itching. It was as if there was something in her blood. She felt it in her hands, up her arms and in her heart. </p> \n<p> Then the severe abdominal pains and headaches started. She went for the Ebola test and the next day it was confirmed that she had tested positive. </p> \n<p> Sesay was admitted on 4 July. She was bleeding through her nose and vomited blood for six days. It would take 20 days for her to recover and be discharged from hospital.</p> \n<p> But Tata caught the virus too. “She is my only daughter. She contracted the virus from me. I felt very worried. But we both survived.”</p> \n<p>Their survival was celebrated in a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2014/aug/09/ebola-sierra-leone-myths-misconceptions\">series of images taken by the UN children’s agency, Unicef</a>, and published on the Global development site in August.</p> \n<p> However, the problems of the Ebola outbreak are not limited to the virus itself. Working in the Ebola treatment centre, even before she caught the disease, was a lonely experience, says Sesay. People stopped coming round to see her. Rumours spread about what Ebola was and who was responsible.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456527233__\n</div> \n<p>“It was very difficult for us nurses at the time,” she says. “People in Kenema said we nurses were the ones who were killing the patients. They thought the president had given us money to reduce the population. They said Ebola was not real.</p> \n<p>“And when we were discharged, if you saw us you would run away. People were afraid of us. Still some people won’t speak to me but it is getting better.”</p> \n<p>After Sesay was discharged from hospital she was given a payment for three months, from July to September, but then the money stopped. Physically recovering from Ebola took a long time and both Sesay and Tata look tired, months after their initial illness.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I can't work like I used to.

The result is a tamer civil society.”<br /></p> \n<p>Xi’s crackdown has targeted a variety of groups from grassroots activists to influential bloggers, journalists, civil rights lawyers and academics.<br /></p> \n<p>Public security officials are likely to be given far greater control over the activities of foreign NGOs under draft legislation that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/mar/30/ngos-china-fear-security-clampdown\">Beijing says is needed to protect “national security and social stability”</a>.</p> \n<p>Eva Pils, an academic from King’s College London who studies civil society and human rights in China, said the outlook was “very bleak” with moderate groups and individuals now finding themselves in Beijing’s crosshairs. <br /></p> \n<p>“It’s now no longer just a few radicals who are being perceived as somehow suspect and potential enemies of the state. Rather the party-state has communicated the message that actually we just don’t want civil society as a whole. We don’t want civil society as a potentially oppositional, liberal force within the system,” she said.<br /></p> \n<p>Under Xi, the Communist party had used both nationalistic propaganda and the promise of action on issues such as corruption to try to reinforce its authority, said Joshua Rosenzweig, a Hong Kong-based human rights researcher. </p> \n<p>“The repression message is: ‘If you persist in criticism – in mobilising independently within society – then, in the interests of Chinese society at large, we, the party, will stop you, we will throw you in jail, we will cut off or restrict your access to the internet, we will close down your organisation.’”<br /></p> \n<p>“More than in recent years the party is wielding a stick to make sure that its message is received,” Rosenzweig added. </p> \n<p>Party leaders had feared the west was seeking to topple them by using foreign NGOs to incite a colour revolution for at least a decade, Rosenzweig said.

If he left, the judge said, it would damage South Africa’s international reputation.</p> \n<p>In a statement issued at the weekend, the ICC called on South Africa, which has signed up to the court, to detain Bashir and “spare no effort in ensuring the execution of the [two] arrest warrants”.</p> \n<p>It also expressed “deep concern about the negative consequences for the court in case of non-execution of the warrants by states parties and, in this regard, urges them to respect their obligations to cooperate with the court”.</p> \n<p>South Africa’s foreign ministry did not immediately comment. As an ICC signatory, the government is obliged to exercise its arrest warrants.</p> \n<p>Bashir was originally indicted more than a decade ago. “He would be a fool if he had not sought guarantees he would not be transferred before leaving for South Africa,” one ICC official was reported as saying.</p> \n<p>Since his indictment in 2009, he has mostly travelled to countries that have not joined the ICC. “We are all happy to be here.

Among them was 56-year-old Guliko Chitadze, who was attacked by one of the zoo’s tigers last month and lost an arm. She had just returned to work, telling fellow staff she did not blame the tiger for what happened. She lived in the zoo grounds with her husband, who died with her. </p> \n<p>The escaped hippo was cornered in one of the city’s main squares on Sunday and subdued with a tranquilliser gun, the zoo said. Some other animals also have been seized, but it remained unclear how many were still on the loose. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"158893121753a01e986767d95f5f029b0c1de5e4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434276664438/19f5ae16-de5a-4d83-9784-801417a72436-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A man directs a hippopotamus after it was shot with a tranquilizer dart.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A man directs a hippopotamus after it was shot with a tranquilizer dart.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Beso Gulashvili/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c80b2d59cc98788b1307fc4d44543308ea4dc1eb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434276742577/a7a48bed-009d-4c1d-8520-69f56eebf6f1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"People help direct the tranquilised hippopotamus.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People help move the hippopotamus to safety</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tinatin Kiguradze/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Police with rifles were still combing the tree-covered hills above the zoo looking for the escaped animals as the remains of a hyena shot dead lay in the nearby grounds of Tbilisi State University. It had chased one of the staff, according to a police officer, who then locked himself in a shed and called for help.</p> \n<p>There are also reports of people using their hunting rifles to shoot animals they see, and Gurielidze appealed for them not to, in case they could be saved. There were no immediate reports that any of the other fatalities were due to animal attacks.</p> \n<p>Among the biggest tragedies for the zoo is the loss of a rare white lion called Shumba. It had become one of the zoo’s biggest attractions after they paired it with a dog to keep it company, after Shumba’s mother stopped caring for him. They became friends and could be seen playing and sleeping together right outside the zoo’s main offices. <br /></p> \n<p>Images on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/CityHallofTbilisi?fref=ts\">Tbilisi city hall’s Facebook page</a> showed roads submerged by floodwater and landslides with many vehicles washed away, while rescue workers carried people on their shoulders through waist-high water. Such heavy rain is unusual for this time of year. But many say uncontrolled development in the area made things worse, with the drainage system overwhelmed. The zoo, situated at the bottom of a valley in the city, was right in the target of line of the surge of water that resulted.<br /></p> \n<p>The head of Georgia’s Orthodox church, Patriarch Ilia II, said the flood was punishment for the zoo being built by the country’s former communist rulers. “They ordered that all the crosses and bells in churches be melted down and the money used to build the zoo,” he said. “I am very sorry that Georgians fell so that a zoo was built at the expense of destroyed churches.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434271373622/0f27b398-05ab-4324-8ff6-b38b02fdd28e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"BESO GULASHVILI/REUTERS","altText":"A hippopotamus walks across a flooded street in Tbilisi, Georgia.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: BESO GULASHVILI/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434277775122/4dfa482c-eb47-4cd6-ba00-fe968a930443-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A stranded bear stands on the second-story windowsill of a house in Tbilisi.
