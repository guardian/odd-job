These recommendations are chiefly aimed at protecting internet users who are not Facebook members,” he said.</p> \n<p>A Facebook spokesperson said: “We were surprised and disappointed that, after the [Belgium privacy commission] had already agreed to meet with us on the 19 June to discuss their recommendations, they took the theatrical action of bringing Facebook Belgium to court on the day beforehand. </p> \n<p>They added: “Although we are confident that there is no merit to the [Belgium privacy commission]’s case, we remain happy to work with them in an effort to resolve their concerns, through a dialogue with us at Facebook Ireland and with our regulator, the Irish data protection commissioner.”</p> \n<p>The outcome of the case could result in similar lawsuits in Europe, should the judge find in the Belgian privacy commission’s favour. A Dutch court recently ruled that Facebook’s operations in the Netherlands were not responsible for data protection issues, with the responsibility lying with Facebook in Ireland.</p> \n<h2>Tracking users, non-users and logged out users without consent</h2> \n<p>According to the report on which the commission is now acting, Facebook has been tracking users on a long-term basis who visit any page – be it a fan page, profile or any other portion of the site that does not require a Facebook account to visit – belonging to the Facebook.com domain.</p> \n<p>The privacy commission’s opinion <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/15/facebook-must-stop-tracking-users-non-users-legal-action\">published in May</a> made it clear that Facebook should discontinue such tracking and seek explicit consent from users before conducting tracking. Facebook’s current measures of seeking consent were deemed insufficient putting it in breach of EU data protection laws.</p> \n<p>Facebook said at the time of the report that it was regulated by the Irish data protection commissioner, as it operates within Europe from Ireland, and that it would review the Belgian report and opinion with its Irish regulators.</p> \n<p>The social network is facing several battles within Europe over privacy.</p> \n<p>The European commission recently warned that EU citizens should <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/26/leave-facebook-snooped-on-warns-eu-safe-harbour-privacy-us\">close their Facebook accounts</a> if they want to keep their information private from US security services, after finding that current Safe Harbour legislation does not protect citizen’s data.<br /></p> \n<p>Facebook was also recently ordered by a Vienna court to respond to a class action data privacy lawsuit that was filed against Facebook in Austria by privacy activist and lawyer Max Schrems, which is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/aug/22/court-orders-facebook-response-on-facebook-v-europe-privacy-case\">seeking damages of €500</a> (&pound;397) per plaintiff for alleged data protection violations.<br /></p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/26/leave-facebook-snooped-on-warns-eu-safe-harbour-privacy-us\">Leave Facebook if you don’t want to be spied on, warns EU</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/mar/31/facebook-tracks-all-visitors-breaching-eu-law-report\">Facebook ‘tracks all visitors, breaching EU law’</a></strong></p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434360649324/9ae7bf81-985f-4939-8030-14fbc0749573-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"facebook","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Manjunath Kiran/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T10:44:15Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T10:45:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Samuel Gibbs","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/samuel-gibbs"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Facebook","Privacy","Social media","Social networking","Internet","Technology","Advertising","Media","Belgium","World news","Europe"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/facebook","webTitle":"Facebook"},{"id":"world/privacy","webTitle":"Privacy"},{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media"},{"id":"media/socialnetworking","webTitle":"Social networking"},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"media/advertising","webTitle":"Advertising"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"world/belgium","webTitle":"Belgium"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Samuel Gibbs","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/samuel-gibbs"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/15/belgium-facebook-court-privacy-breaches-ads","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49nnf","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/jun/15/belgium-facebook-court-privacy-breaches-ads","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/15/belgium-facebook-court-privacy-breaches-ads"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434360649324/9ae7bf81-985f-4939-8030-14fbc0749573-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Facebook faces lawsuit over its alleged privacy law violations around user tracking from the Belgian privacy commission.

Mauritanian media, including Sahara Media, are opening a window into the shadowy world of Islamist groups operating in the vast, lawless Sahara. While other journalists fled after the Islamists seized control of northern Mali, Sahara Media kept a correspondent in the ancient caravan town of Timbuktu, documenting how al Qaeda's north African wing AQIM imposed violent sharia law, including amputation of limbs, and destroyed sacred Sufi mausoleums. Sahara Media also covers regional news and affairs, especially from Algeria and Morocco, in French, and has chat forums and ads as well.
