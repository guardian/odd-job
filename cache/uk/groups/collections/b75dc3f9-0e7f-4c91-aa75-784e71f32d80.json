Damascus is a blur in the distance, but the villages on the edge of the Golan Heights are easily visible below, deceptively peaceful in the afternoon sun.</p> \n<p>Perched on the windswept 6,500 ft peak, the Israeli army has a bird’s eye view of what is happening as Syria disintegrates. Hadr, a pro-regime Druze village, fell to rebel fighters on Wednesday. Nearby Jubata al-Khashab is held by loyalist forces. Jabhat al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaida, is advancing.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Mount Hermon map\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1434648095325/Mount-Hermon-map.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>On the Syrian and Lebanese sides of the border, this eyrie is known as Jebel al-Sheikh. It saw fierce fighting in the 1973 war but for 40 years watched over a quiet front, the peace maintained by Hafez al-Assad. In recent weeks, however, signs have multiplied that the end may be approaching for his son Bashar.</p> \n<p>“Syria is dead,” Moshe Yaalon, Israel’s defence minister, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/11/israels-strategic-position-enhanced-by-chaos-of-arab-neighbourhood\">declared last week.</a> “Assad is paid to be president but he only runs a quarter of the country. He can stay in his palace but he’s no longer relevant. He’s on the way out.”</p> \n<p>Syria’s Druze community – around 5% of the population – has been split between supporters and opponents of Assad but has largely managed to stay out of the war. Now they have been targeted by Nusra and Islamic State (Isis). That has alarmed their co-religionists in Lebanon, on the Israeli-occupied Golan – and in Israel proper, where, unlike Arab citizens, the minority serve in the armed forces.<br /></p> \n<p>Israeli Druze have demonstrated outside the Knesset in Jerusalem, demanding action to save their brethren, but to no avail. “Many in southern Syria expect Israel to do something to keep the knives of Isis away from the throats of the Druze,” said a supporter, Mordechai Kedar, recalling the fate of the Yazidis in Iraq. Still, the army did send messages to Nusra, via the mainstream Free Syrian Army (FSA), warning the Islamist group not to harm Syria’s Druze.</p> \n<p>Publicly, Israel insists it is sticking to its policy of staying out of the conflict next door. But that is not the whole story. Ehud Yaari, a well-connected Middle East analyst, <a href=\"http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/tough-dilemma-in-southern-syria\">wrote last October</a> that some rebel groups were maintaining “constant contact with the IDF” (Israel Defence Forces) though they had only been given a modest amount of weapons. <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.630359\">UN reports</a> have described Israeli troops handing boxes to armed Syrians.</p> \n<p>Evidence of links to anti-Assad groups – including Nusra – meets official silence. In one intriguing case, subject to censorship and a legal gag order, a Druze activist from the Golan and a serving IDF Druze soldier<a href=\"http://www.richardsilverstein.com/2015/03/03/shin-bet-partially-lifts-gag-order-regarding-secretly-arrested-golani-druze/\"> reportedly </a>learned of and filmed a covert meeting between Israeli intelligence officers and Syrian rebels.</p> \n<p>Exactly what Israel’s “eyes and ears” can glean about its neighbour from Mount Hermon is a closely guarded military secret. But the implosion of Syria has brought new challenges. “In terms of knowing the enemy we used to need to know the name of the Syrian president and chief of staff,” Yaalon observed. “Now we need to know the leaders of every single militia.”</p> \n<p>Three years ago, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2012/jul/17/israel-old-certainties-crumble\">Israel looked at the war in Syria</a> as part of what it called an “Islamist winter” – scorning the naivety of those who hailed the dawn of freedom and democracy in the Arab spring. Maintaining its own red lines has meant repeated air strikes on weapons transfers to Hezbollah, Assad’s loyal Lebanese ally, and swift responses to rare cases of cross-border firing. In January it <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jan/19/top-iranian-general-hezbollah-fighters-killed-israel-attack-syria\">targeted</a> a Hezbollah unit and also killed an Iranian revolutionary guard general.</p> \n<p>The most visible non-lethal aspect of what Israel is doing is treating wounded Syrians, both fighters and civilians, including women and children, who have been allowed to cross the Golan border – 1600 since February 2013.<br /></p> \n<p>“We didn’t want anyone to think that we were part of the conflict in Syria,” explained Dr Salman Zarka, the Druze director of the Ziv medical centre in Safed in Galilee. “We thought it would all be over in a few months, that Assad would leave the county and everything would be better. As a people we understood the meaning of not providing support when somebody needs it.”</p> \n<p>Samir is an FSA fighter who was wounded by a bomb dropped from a Syrian army helicopter in Beit Jann near Quneitra, south-east of Mount Hermon. Now recovering in a Ziv orthopaedic ward with three other injured Syrians, he had feared he would not get good medical care in Israel but is grateful that he did. He hopes to cross back across the border soon to carry on fighting the regime. “A lot of my friends were here before me,” Samir said. “Assad knows that we are here.”<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434621023585/cbdcf8e8-2b5e-4974-a13e-f0018265adaf-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"STR New / Reuters/Reuters","altText":"Israeli early warning station on Mount Hermon over the clouds on the Golan Heights.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: STR New / Reuters/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T04:00:04Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T04:54:43Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Black","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ianblack"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Israel","Syria","Middle East and North Africa","World news","Arab and Middle East unrest"],"tags":[{"id":"world/israel","webTitle":"Israel"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/arab-and-middle-east-protests","webTitle":"Arab and Middle East unrest"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian Black","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ianblack"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/19/israelis-watch-intently-as-syrian-rebel-forces-approach-golan-heights-border","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49qbx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/19/israelis-watch-intently-as-syrian-rebel-forces-approach-golan-heights-border","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/19/israelis-watch-intently-as-syrian-rebel-forces-approach-golan-heights-border"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434621023585/cbdcf8e8-2b5e-4974-a13e-f0018265adaf-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Israeli early warning station on Mount Hermon, above the cloud line on the Golan Heights.

He said Segue had “built more than 6,000 units and has never had an incident like this in its history”.</p> \n<p>Singer said his San Francisco-based public relations firm was “substantially reducing our role” representing the company, and referred further inquiries to the president of Segue Construction, Erick Hockaday, who could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.</p> \n<p> In the Park Broadway lawsuit, the homeowners association listed 29 incidents of water damage, including “the windows, patio doors and deck doors, and their systems allow excessive condensation to enter the structure and cause damage to other components”, court documents show.</p> \n<p> Court files include photographs of reconstruction work at the Park Broadway units that attorneys said showed water damage to support systems for patios, balconies and other outdoor spaces. </p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/441358f95a37078eb5c87e20b23724f78747e357/0_0_4908_2946/4908.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2946,"width":4908,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Chiu/AP","altText":"Kathy Huff visits a memorial left for victims of a Library Gardens apartment building balcony that collapsed in Berkeley, Calif., Thursday, June 18, 2015.

One had a living room. Another had a fireplace on each floor. The one I work in now was once a luxurious walk-up apartment in a formerly upscale district of the capital. If you pay attention, you can pick out bedrooms and might even notice the under-equipped kitchen that now serves as our cafeteria. Some of our products are on display in a recessed vitrine meant for storing expensive china. I’m told the pole that runs the length of the parquet flooring downstairs means they once <a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/06/her-life-as-a-persian-ballerina.html\">taught ballet</a> here.</p> \n<p>There’s something charming about having your tea break in a yard someone’s three-year-old may have learned to ride a tricycle in decades ago. But you miss conveniently placed phone jacks, bathrooms with stalls, walls that are penetrable by cellphone signals and empty conference rooms with white boards and projectors. Not to mention that deathly synthetic office carpet that makes you feel like you belong.</p> \n<p>Tehran needs office buildings that were meant to be office buildings. And while some <a href=\"http://royal-tower.ir/#/,'FE'JJ%20(1,%201HJ'D\">property developers</a> are spending tens of millions of dollars to rectify the shortage, I don’t think they have small to mid-sized companies in mind. </p> \n<p>The typical workday in Iran is supposed to start at 8 or 8.30am and end at 4.30pm, a standard eight-hour shift. But most of us work (unpaid) overtime - my floor strolls in at 9am and almost always ends up working until at least 6pm. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/nov/22/iran-state-tv-versus\">Iran's state TV tries 'soft power' to win hearts and minds</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Upon arrival, I say hello to the security guard on duty and make a point of mentioning his name. He sits in a little shed they’ve somehow managed to squeeze underneath the stairwell and tries to pass the time by watching state TV all day. (If you’ve ever watched state television in Iran, you will understand how impressive this is). I then use the wall-mounted fingerprint reader to check into the building. These machines are quite popular here in Iran, I’ve noticed.</p> \n<p>Office life is rife with the same curiosities as most other places in the world. There’s the guy who wears the same thing every day (or maybe he just happens to own five of everything). There’s the copy-machine that doubles as a black hole for anything you load into it, forcing you to harass Miss F to copy and scan your documents. There’s also a highly coveted paperclip-storing tape-dispensing pen-holding apparatus. I scavenged one from another guy who left because he couldn’t get along with the CEO’s right-hand-woman.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tehran metro\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; \n  &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; \n   &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/28sIcqCBOE/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;A photo posted by TAHA パプリカ (@paprikaaa)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2015-05-21T15:02:22+00:00&quot;&gt;May 21, 2015 at 8:02am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>It bears mentioning that not getting along with the right-hand-woman (RHW) can portend bad news. Iran is, after all, a country where loyalty, trustworthiness, and seniority trump most other personal qualities. It’s why a lot of companies and government organs are staffed with unqualified but feverishly loyal “managers” who might even be related to the boss. Who’s more trustworthy than family, right?</p> \n<p>While she might not be a relative, the RHW has been here for around 10 years and regardless of her qualifications, the CEO even trusts her to pack his suitcases and fold his clothes. If you’re working with her and she forgets something, as she is wont to do, it’s best to play it off as your own mistake since blaming her could mean getting on her bad side.</p> \n<p>The bad side is something our office secretaries have seen repeatedly. It’s probably why there emerges a vicious rivalry between any fresh-meat secretary and the RHW. We once had a particularly productive secretary who, office rumors had it, got into a nasty fight with the RHW. Incensed, the secretary approached the CEO with an ultimatum: “if you don’t get rid of her, I’ll leave.” So she left. When the man who replaced her took over, the patriarchy that underlies our office culture had us call him “head of the office” instead of secretary. But then he left too, for the same reasons. Thankfully, I happen to have an amicable working relationship with the RHW, who once gave me a slice of her leftover pizza. I also got her sister a cellphone charger.</p> \n<p>The other prickly character is that mid-level manager no one seems to get along with. Most pass along his demands as “what Mr So-and-So wants,” often tail-ended with sneering comments as in, “sorry man, it’s not me, but Mr So-and-So said we need this [rather useless task] done by tomorrow.” One of our company’s most valuable employees was so agitated by Mr So-and-So’s belligerently demanding behavior, he specifically asked the CEO to “get him away from me.” And because this employee was involved in a highly sensitive project, it worked. Another employee - a college kid - was fired after he had a dispute with Mr So-and-So. Few people, I’ve realized, leave the company on good terms and in-fighting is the one of the main sources of brain-drain.</p> \n<p>Our work week runs from Saturday to Wednesday, because Friday is the day of prayer and Thursday…is the day before it. Government offices, schools, and many private companies are closed on these days. All this can make international trade a challenge because it means we can only do business with the rest of the world for three days. A lot of us who deal with international affairs might sometimes be expected to work the weekend, ie Thursday and Friday, and then wake up Saturday to a world that’s busy enjoying its own weekend. Some of the foreign companies we work with have kindly tried to accommodate our alien schedule. Amid all of this is chatter that the government once upon a time considered taking Friday and Saturday off so Iran would only lose one day of international trade.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/04/iran-private-businesses-linked-regime-organizations\">How to succeed in Iran: lessons from Russia and China</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For a while, most internal office communication took place on <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/viber\">Viber</a> as opposed to an @company.com account.

Yes, bureaucratic excess is as painful as it is elsewhere and multi-hour meetings often end on tangents. And sure, there are near-constant smoke-breaks, hallway chats, Facebook browsing (on the company-provided VPN connection), and the opium of the masses that is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/feb/09/clash-of-clans-super-bowl-ad-2015\">Clash of Clans</a>, the popular mobile game.

Some days, if our internet connection doesn’t just up and die, it’ll slow down to the point of being unusable. Or VPN connections will stop working.

But we do it anyway. The college kid who worked across from me made the equivalent of $180 a month. And eavesdropping had me know that bringing a college-educated translator on board would cost somewhere around $350 to $400. Yet regular employees, who I assume must be making a bit more than that amount, own factory-unlocked iPhones, fancy tablets, and reasonably pricey middle class cars.

Our conversations have involved ruminations on what pork tastes like, the god-awful Turkish soap operas on satellite TV, and France’s strict devotion to <em>la&iuml;cit&eacute;</em> (for this topic, the lunch table broke into French nationalists defending the hijab ban in public places and those who argued it’s no different than what the Islamic republic does). None of them wear the standard-issue schoolgirl wimple and instead opt for the casual headscarf they normally wear outside.</p> \n<p>I’ve struggled to find framed photos of Iran’s two supreme leaders, which are common in most offices for the usual reasons (private companies want to win brownie points; the public sector has no choice). </p> \n<p>But there is one hanging in the prayer room, a room few at the office have actually seen. For a company that employs scores of people, no one on the ground floor prays, four people on the second floor do, one person on the third, and I’d assume a couple on the fourth. I guess that’s why the prayer room is no bigger than a walk-in closet. Maybe years ago it actually was a walk-in closet. </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434640526225/8e046810-71c5-480e-825c-7229545f7926-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ahmad/Xinhua Press/Corbis","altText":"Iranian women take food in a park in Tehran, capital of Iran, Jan. 21, 2011.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ahmad/Xinhua Press/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T04:00:04Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T04:00:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":10,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Iran","Viber","Middle East and North Africa","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran"},{"id":"technology/viber","webTitle":"Viber"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Tehran Bureau","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/series/tehran-bureau"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/19/working-in-iran-tehran-office-politics","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49n5m","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/19/working-in-iran-tehran-office-politics","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jun/19/working-in-iran-tehran-office-politics"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434640526225/8e046810-71c5-480e-825c-7229545f7926-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Our lunchtime conversations have involved ruminations on what pork tastes like, the god-awful Turkish soap operas on satellite TV, and France’s strict devotion to <em>laïcité’: </em>Iranian women take food in a park in Tehran, 21 January 2011.
