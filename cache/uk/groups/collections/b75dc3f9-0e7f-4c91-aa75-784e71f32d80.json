The allegations were in an affidavit that was unsealed on Monday.</p> \n<p>The kidnapping case began when the Denise Huskins’ boyfriend, Aaron Quinn, reported kidnappers broke into the couple’s Vallejo home on 23 March, abducted her and demanded an $8,500 ransom.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/mar/28/california-kidnapping-case-lawyers-defend-woman\">California kidnapping case: Lawyers say woman's account not hoax</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Quinn’s lawyers said he awoke to a bright light in his face, and two kidnappers bound and drugged him.</p> \n<p>Huskins, 29, turned up safe two days later in her hometown of Huntington Beach, where she says she was dropped off. She showed up just hours before the ransom was due.</p> \n<p>Huskins and Quinn appeared with their lawyers at a news conference in Vallejo, but they didn’t talk to the media.The teary-eyed couple held hands tightly during the brief conference and hugged before leaving.</p> \n<p>Huskins’ lawyer, Douglas Rappaport, said his client will avoid commenting on the case to preserve the integrity of the prosecution.</p> \n<p>Rappaport and Quinn’s lawyer, Daniel Russo, blasted investigators and asked that authorities set the record straight.</p> \n<p>“What I want is for the Vallejo PD to do their job,” Russo said. “Go out, find out if there are other guys out there and make sure that next time this happens they think before they talk.” </p> \n<p>After Huskins reappeared, Vallejo police said at a news conference the kidnapping was a hoax. Police have since declined to comment other than to say they continue to investigate. A call to Vallejo police was not immediately returned Monday.</p> \n<p>Quinn’s attorneys maintained the kidnapping was real, and people purporting to be the victim’s kidnappers sent an email to Vallejo police demanding they apologize for calling it a hoax and acknowledge they were wrong.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>What I want is for the Vallejo PD to do their job</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Lawyer Douglas Rappaport</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>FBI special agent Jason Walter said in the affidavit, that recently discovered evidence led him to conclude there was probable cause to believe Muller kidnapped the woman.</p> \n<p>Investigators who arrested Muller in South Lake Tahoe found a laptop that resembled one belonging to Quinn. A search of a stolen car connected to Muller turned up numerous other items, including a water pistol with a flashlight and laser pointer on it. People claiming responsibility for the woman’s abduction emailed photos of the items to a newspaper, Walter said.</p> \n<p>A cellphone in the car had one of the same photos, and the vehicle’s navigation system turned up a Huntington Beach address. Detectives also found a pair of goggles with a long blond hair in it, the same hair color as the victim’s. The goggles were similar to those that the woman, and Quinn, said they were forced to wear them during the kidnapping, Walter said.</p> \n<p>On Monday, Muller was in custody on charges of attempted first degree residential robbery and assault in Alameda County, where the home invasion robbery occurred.</p> \n<p>His attorney, Thomas Johnson, said his client would plead not guilty to the kidnapping charges. He said his client had already pleaded not guilty to the June home invasion robbery in Dublin, Ohio.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aeda4707cb025473c139c8be86f386de19a710ab\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/aeda4707cb025473c139c8be86f386de19a710ab/0_0_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denise Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denise Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn appeared at a news conference with their attorneys, but didn’t speak to the media.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Jory/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The FBI affidavit said Muller told investigators he served as a US marine from 1995 to 1999 and attended and taught at Harvard University after that.. According to the affidavit, he said he suffered from psychosis and in 2008 was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.</p> \n<p>Muller was admitted to practice law in California in May 2011. His state bar profile also says he attended Harvard Law School.</p> \n<p>Records show that Muller’s license was suspended in 2013 for failing to pay annual dues. Later that year, the state bar filed disciplinary charges against Muller, citing his failure to file a green card application for a client’s son. The bar notice states Muller took $1,250 in advance money from the client.</p> \n<p>Muller failed to cooperate with the bar’s investigation, leading the State Bar Court to recommend his disbarment in January. The state Supreme Court ordered him disbarred in June.</p> \n<p>Wilson Purves, a partner with the Kerosky Purves &amp; Bogue in San Francisco, said Muller worked as an associate at the immigration law firm for a year before it terminated his employment in 2012. Purves declined to discuss the termination, but he said there was nothing that stood out about Muller.</p> \n<p>“Nothing extraordinary would make me feel that he could be accused of something like this,” he said. “I don’t know what happened between then and now.”</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/eb3e3b10d48b9147561d5ba951f0a28ffcdbf8e0/0_146_2183_1310/2183.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1310,"width":2183,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mike Jory/AP","altText":"Denise Huskins, left, and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mike Jory/AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/aeda4707cb025473c139c8be86f386de19a710ab/0_0_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Denise Huskins and her boyfriend Aaron Quinn appeared at a news conference with their attorneys, but didn’t speak to the media.
