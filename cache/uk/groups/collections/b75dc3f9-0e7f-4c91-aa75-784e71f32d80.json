According to war reports, Katriuk was a member of a Ukrainian battalion of the SS, the elite Nazi storm troops, between 1942 and 1944. He had denied the accusations against him.</p> \n<p>The Russian embassy in Ottawa called on the Canadian government a few weeks ago to support a criminal case against Katriuk. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation, a law enforcement body that reports only to President Vladimir Putin, called on Canada to deliver Katriuk to Moscow so he could be tried for alleged war crimes.</p> \n<p>Canada ignored the request and said it would never recognise Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and its interference in Ukraine.</p> \n<p>A study three years ago alleged Katriuk was a key participant in a village massacre during the second world war. A man with Katriuk’s name lay in wait in March 1943 outside a barn that had been set ablaze, operating a machine-gun and firing on civilians as they tried to flee the burning building, it said.</p> \n<p>“One witness stated that Katriuk was a particularly active participant in the atrocity: he reportedly lay behind the stationary machine-gun, firing rounds on anyone attempting to escape the flames,” the study by Lund University historian Per Anders Rudling says.</p> \n<p>Rudling, whose research was published in spring 2012 issue of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://hgs.oxfordjournals.org/\">Holocaust and Genocide Studies</a>, attributed these details to KGB interrogations released for the first time in 2008.</p> \n<p>Katriuk allegedly deserted his SS unit when it moved to France from eastern Europe in 1944. He lived in Paris before moving to Canada in 1951, according to court documents. He later became a Canadian citizen and lived with his French-born wife in Ontario, working as a beekeeper.</p> \n<p>In 1999, Canada’s federal court ruled Katriuk obtained Canadian citizenship under false pretences, by not telling authorities about his collaboration with the Nazis, but could find no evidence he committed atrocities.

Lakshmi Singh, a teacher who had brought her four-year-old son to a major government clinic in south Delhi, said: “I have been waiting for five hours to be seen by a doctor. We had no power all night because of the cuts and my little boy is sick now. He is vomiting and has [a] headache.”</p> \n<p>Officials at the clinic said most of those who sought help were severely dehydrated and that the old, the very young and the poor had been hardest hit.<br />Hundreds die at the height of summer every year in India, but this year’s figures are already the highest since 1995, when official data showed 1,677 people succumbed to the heat.<br />Southern India has borne the brunt of the sudden spell of hot, dry weather with the states of Telengana and Andhra Pradesh suffering most.<br />The monsoon, predicted to hit southern India’s coastline on 31 May, will bring relief from the high temperatures, but it will not reach the parched north of the country for several weeks.<br />In Delhi, children tried to cool off in the ornamental pools around the presidential palace in the centre of the city. Adults sought out the air-conditioned metro and shopping malls.<br />Many were unable to escape the heat however. Raj Thakur, a traffic policeman, said: “I do a 14-hour shift and am suffering a lot. I try to drink water as much as is possible. At night I cannot sleep either and I am not eating well.”</p> \n<p>Tourists have fled the city for hill resorts such as Simla and Mussoorie in the foothills of the Himalayas.<br />Temperatures have topped 45 degrees in Delhi, the capital, in recent days. The highest ever recorded in the city is 47.2 degrees, in May 1944. <br />Earlier this week temperatures of nearly 48 were recorded in Allahabad, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and in Telengana, in the south.</p> \n<p>The record for India is thought to be 50.6C, recorded in 1956 in the northern town of Alwar.<br />In some rural areas of India said they were “getting on with life”. Rubina Parisa, from a small coastal village in Odisha, the poor eastern state, said: “There are lots of weddings. You can’t stop everything just because it is hot. It’s hot every summer anyway, and at least we don’t have pollution here like in the cities.”</p> \n<p>Local authorities have launched awareness campaigns, telling people to stay indoors, drink fluids and wear cool clothing.<br />Many of the casualties have been homeless people or day labourers, among the poorest sections of society.<br />Experts said compiling casualty statistics for heatwaves was extremely difficult owing to the challenges of attributing cause of death and registering fatalities in remote areas.<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Climate experts said the number of days when temperatures approached 45 degrees has increased in the past 15 years and that nocturnal temperatures in India’s cities have risen significantly as a result of overcrowding.<br tabindex=\"-1\" />“The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Delhi/more-heat-waves-coming-warns-cse/article7258213.ece\">number of heatwave days may go up</a> from about five to between 30 and 40 every year,” Arjuna Srinidhi, of the Centre for Science and Environment, told the Hindu newspaper.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/819768a00b305d045ca294b2d957901c1261ad6f/184_0_3712_2228/3712.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2228,"width":3712,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Divyakant Solanki/EPA","altText":"A vendor waits for customers to buy air-conditioners and ventilators in Ahmedabad.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-29T07:51:20Z","lastModified":"2015-05-29T07:54:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":7,"contributors":[{"name":"Jason Burke","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jasonburke"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["India","South and Central Asia","Natural disasters and extreme weather","Meteorology"],"tags":[{"id":"world/india","webTitle":"India"},{"id":"world/south-and-central-asia","webTitle":"South and Central Asia"},{"id":"world/natural-disasters","webTitle":"Natural disasters and extreme weather"},{"id":"science/meteorology","webTitle":"Meteorology"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jason Burke","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jasonburke"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/29/no-relief-from-india-heatwave-as-death-toll-reaches-20-year-high","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ap9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/29/no-relief-from-india-heatwave-as-death-toll-reaches-20-year-high","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/29/no-relief-from-india-heatwave-as-death-toll-reaches-20-year-high"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/819768a00b305d045ca294b2d957901c1261ad6f/184_0_3712_2228/3712.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2228,"width":3712,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A vendor waits for customers to buy air-conditioners and ventilators in Ahmedabad.

Be careful not to look down or you might regret it.</p> \n<p>She tumbles backward and the screen goes black. “When you reach the bottom everything will be OK,” she says.</p> \n<p>The video is one of a series of mock abortion tutorials, part of a public campaign urging Chile to allow women to end pregnancies in cases of rape or medical complications. It would be a radical change for Chile, one of only four countries that prohibit all abortion, according to the New York-based Center for Reproductive Rights, though a handful of others are so restrictive that they have de facto bans.</p> \n<p>The videos are deliberately dark and disturbing, appearing to show pregnant women throwing themselves into traffic or thrusting their stomachs onto fire hydrants. Released in April, the videos organised by Miles, a non-governmental group, aim to rally support for an attempt by the president, Michelle Bachelet, to ease the abortion ban.</p> \n<p>Miles director Claudia Dides said: “Clandestine abortions are carried out in Chile and abortions will continue with or without politicians or a law.</p> \n<p>“What we want is for abortions to be safe.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AVozmOcBzo\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9AVozmOcBzo?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  An advertisement showing a mock abortion tutorial.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The debate comes as Chile, one of Latin America’s most socially conservative countries, grapples with shifting views on once-taboo issues. The mostly Roman Catholic country began to allow divorce in 2004. This year, Congress recognised civil unions for gay couples and, recently, a pilot program in Santiago harvested the country’s first legal medical marijuana.</p> \n<p>The changing attitudes mark a generational shift, as young people born after the 1973-1990 military dictatorship come of age. The trend has accelerated since a wave of student protests demanding educational reform began in 2011 and in the wake of Catholic priest sex-abuse scandals that have provoked questioning of church doctrine.</p> \n<p>In 2013, then-president Sebasti&aacute;n Pi&ntilde;era came under fire when he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/jul/10/chilean-president-praises-raped-pregnancy\">praised a pregnant 11-year-old girl for her “depth and maturity”</a> after she said in a TV interview that she wanted to keep the baby, the product of a rape by her mother’s partner.</p> \n<p>A recent discussion on abortion at Santiago’s Diego Portales University drew a packed audience, with many students forced to sit on the floor.</p> \n<p>“As a country, we are behind,” said Fernanda Saavedra, a student who attended. “We need to evolve and think more about women.”</p> \n<p>Chile legalised abortion for medical reasons in 1931, 18 years before it allowed women to vote. But during the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, abortion was banned under all circumstances.</p> \n<p>Today, women found guilty of having abortions face prison terms of up to five years.</p> \n<p>Still, an estimated 120,000 illegal abortions are performed every year, according to the Miles group. Most women use the drug misoprostol, buying it on the black market, to end first-trimester pregnancies. Others undergo conventional abortions in secret. Those who can afford to travel seek abortions in neighbouring Argentina or beyond.</p> \n<p>Nelly Milad flew to Cuba in 2004 to end an unviable pregnancy. “I’ve felt so much impotence, frustration and anger. You feel so left behind by a medical team that can’t help you even when they morally want to, because they fear they’ll be thrown into jail,” Milad said.</p> \n<p>Andrea Quiroga, an accountant, was newly married in 2010 when she learned her 11-week-old foetus would not survive. Nevertheless, the law required her to continue the pregnancy until the unborn girl died at 26 weeks and doctors were allowed to induce delivery.</p> \n<p>“It was so brutal,” she said. “I had to give birth to my daughter and see her bleeding in my arms. I don’t think anyone should have to go through that because it stays with you the rest of your life.”</p> \n<p>Bachelet – a physician and former head of UN Women, the agency for gender equality – was scolded by conservative politicians and even some allies in 2006 when, during her first term, she legalised distribution of the morning-after pill.</p> \n<p>Her new proposal would allow abortion for cases of rape, a pregnancy that endangers a woman and situations when a foetus is unviable. It is expected to go before lawmakers in the next few months and is likely to face strong opposition even though Bachelet supporters control Congress.</p> \n<p>Jorge Sabag, a lawmaker for the opposition Christian Democratic party, said: “The reasons to interrupt a pregnancy keep expanding and we’re going to reach an abortion a la carte.”</p> \n<p>The Catholic archbishop of Santiago, Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati, has urged Chileans to protect the unborn. In a recent statement, Chilean bishops said there was no justification for so-called “therapeutic” abortions when a woman’s health was at risk and that “in no instance does it help heal traumatic moments”.</p> \n<p>Most Chileans appear to think otherwise. A poll released in 2014 said 70% supported abortion in cases of rape and slightly more for unviable pregnancies or when a woman’s health was at risk. The survey by Centro de Estudios P&uacute;blicos questioned 1,442 people between July and August and had an error margin of three percentage points.</p> \n<p>One young woman, who used misoprostol to terminate an unplanned pregnancy in January, said such decisions should be left to women. She insisted on not being quoted by name to keep her family from learning of her abortion.</p> \n<p>“I’d tell every woman who wants to abort or has aborted in Chile that there’s nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to feel guilty about. Our bodies belong to us and it’s our decision,” she said.</p> \n<p>“Most politicians and priests are men. So why should they get to say anything about this?”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2fc5d6d00a8d54bff3c38b2a60fea521f0cfdd6a/805_575_4364_2618/4364.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2618,"width":4364,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Luis Hidalgo/AP","altText":"A 25-year-old woman in Chile who did not want to be identified","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Luis Hidalgo/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-29T01:07:13Z","lastModified":"2015-05-29T01:07:13Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Chile","Abortion","Americas","Women","Health"],"tags":[{"id":"world/chile","webTitle":"Chile"},{"id":"world/abortion","webTitle":"Abortion"},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/29/abortion-video-tutorial-ads-shock-chile-amid-debate-on-easing-ban","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49an3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/29/abortion-video-tutorial-ads-shock-chile-amid-debate-on-easing-ban","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/29/abortion-video-tutorial-ads-shock-chile-amid-debate-on-easing-ban"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2fc5d6d00a8d54bff3c38b2a60fea521f0cfdd6a/805_575_4364_2618/4364.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2618,"width":4364,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A 25-year-old woman who did not want to be identified, said: ‘I’d tell every woman who wants to abort or has aborted in Chile that there’s nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to feel guilty about.’ Photograph: Luis Hidalgo/AP","credit":"Luis Hidalgo/AP","altText":"A 25-year-old woman in Chile who did not want to be identified","cleanCaption":"A 25-year-old woman who did not want to be identified, said: ‘I’d tell every woman who wants to abort or has aborted in Chile that there’s nothing to be ashamed of, nothing to feel guilty about.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Luis Hidalgo/AP"}},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"'Close your eyes'"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[]},{"title":"Greece talks continue in wake of Lagarde's Grexit warning","rawTitle":"Greece talks continue in wake of Lagarde's Grexit warning","item":{"type":"liveBlog","id":"business/live/2015/may/29/greek-bailout-markets-lagarde-us-economy-live","title":"Greece talks continue in wake of Lagarde's Grexit warning","trailText":"Rolling coverage of economics and the financial markets, as uncertainty swirls around Greece’s bailout negotiations","standFirst":"<p>Rolling coverage of economics and the financial markets, as uncertainty swirls around Greece’s bailout negotiations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/may/29/greek-bailout-markets-lagarde-us-economy-live#block-5568004ce4b097716aa3473d\">Introduction: Negotiations resuming today</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/may/29/greek-bailout-markets-lagarde-us-economy-live#block-55681022e4b08e6e9b148748\">Moscovici: We’re dedicating to avoiding Grexit</a></p>","byline":"Graeme Wearden","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0590f6c9e4fce7f31f5eb5e6f2cdc0a0caa79260/0_0_3500_2100/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2100,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sean Gallup/Getty Images","altText":"DRESDEN, GERMANY - MAY 28:  International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde attends a working session during a meeting of finance ministers of the G7 group of nations on May 28, 2015 in Dresden, Germany.

A US official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said negotiators were close to a new deal that would bring annual payouts to $3.6bn to $3.7bn on average.</p> \n<p> An Israeli official, who also declined to be named, put the expected aid at between $3.5bn and $4bn. “[The United States] are trying to douse the fires after our flare-up about the Iran deal,” the official added, referring to curbs being negotiated on Tehran’s disputed nuclear programme, which Israel has condemned as insufficient.</p> \n<p> Responding to reports that an increased defence aid package was in the works, the Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, confirmed there were such discussions with the Americans but said he would keep campaigning against Iran.</p> \n<p> “There is no trade-off requiring I agree to this [nuclear] deal with Iran. The deal is bad and we will continue to oppose it,” Netanyahu said in remarks quoted by Israeli broadcasters.</p> \n<p> In Washington, a White House National Security Council spokesman, Alistair Baskey, said: “These reports are wholly inaccurate.”</p> \n<p> “While we anticipate discussions in the coming period between the US and Israeli governments about how long-term security cooperation between the two countries can be further strengthened, no such detailed discussions at a senior level have occurred recently,” Baskey said.</p> \n<p> The Pentagon had no immediate comment.</p> \n<p> The previous US administration signed a 10-year deal with Israel in 2007 giving it $30bn, most of which must be spent on American military products.

If the vote does takes place it will be in a secret ballot.</p> \n<p>There has been confusion over what precise numbers are required to suspend Israel, with Fifa officials previously insisting that a 75% majority was required.</p> \n<p>Both Palestinian and Israeli delegations in Zurich have been working around the clock since arriving in the midst of the biggest scandal to hit the world football organisation.</p> \n<p>Twin Swiss and US investigations focussing on a far-reaching culture of kickbacks in Fifa have thrown the congress in Zurich into chaos, including both the re-election bid of Fifa president Sepp Blatter and other business on the agenda including the Palestinian bid to have Israel suspended.</p> \n<p>Israel has sought the support of the European regional grouping UEFA of which it is a member to vote against the proposed suspension.</p> \n<p>Its efforts to avoid a vote – which some see as damaging in itself as a vote for suspension – have seen it enlist Israel’s ministry of foreign affairs as well as the lobbying of key Fifa officials.</p> \n<p>The Israeli prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, weighed in on Thursday, telling reporters that if Israel is suspended “it would be a blatant politicisation of sport and the result will be Fifa’s collapse”.</p> \n<p>Mediation efforts led by Blatter, who visited Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories last week, has made progress on some issues. </p> \n<p>According to Blatter, he reached agreement with Netanyahu on several key areas, including providing laissez passer documents to Palestinian athletes, referees and sports officials; an exemption from customs on all sports equipment to the Palestinian Football Association and the establishment of a committee to hear disagreements.</p> \n<p>Israel is however refusing to budge on a final critical issue – the Palestinian demand to suspend Israeli teams based in the occupied territories.</p> \n<p>At a meeting on Thursday, Blatter reportedly suggested to Israel that on the issue of the five settlement teams Fifa could approach the UN which would be asked to determine if they were on Israeli territory – an offer declined by Ofer Eini, the Israeli Football Association chairman. </p> \n<p>Commenting on the continued push for a vote, the head of the Palestinian Football Association, Jibril Rajoub, said: “For years, I talked to anyone I could so that Israel would change its policy and be fair in how it treated Palestinian athletes. It was in vain.</p> \n<p>“In the end, there was no choice but to go to Fifa and ask it to protect the Palestinian athletes. And now, either there will be a solution that will make it possible for us to practice sports, or reach a situation that I don’t wish on anyone, and that is suspension. But who is responsible for this? I think it is the Israeli government.”</p> \n<p>Israeli analysts were torn over the impact the Fifa corruption scandal might have on an eventual vote, with some predicting that delegates might want to avoid further controversy in an already fraught congress.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the Israeli website Walla, Rotem Kamer, chief executive of the Israeli Football Association, said the combination of the corruption scandal and Blatter’s bid for re-election had complicated issues.</p> \n<p>“There is no way of knowing which way the vote will go when Blatter is seeking re-election. There is no doubt that [Blatter] can be pressured, also because of the affair that has just exploded. He needs the Arab votes and it could be that to this end, Israel will have to be sacrificed.”</p> \n<p>In the runup to the vote both Palestinian and Israelis were trying to voice optimism about the outcome, with Israel suggesting it had assurances from some 70% of delegations. For its part Palestinian officials were equally confidant about the vote. </p> \n<p>“It is not a question of how many vote for us,” said one, “but at this stage how many actually vote against the motion.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/300b1b4ae8ceff62b605b3a8e89973c4cb88323d/0_0_4096_2460/4096.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2460,"width":4096,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Atef Safadi/EPA","altText":"epa04772095 An elderly Palestinian activist holds a red card with Arabic letters reading, 'to suspend Israel's membership in FIFA', and say no to racism, during a rally in support of the Palestinian Football Federation, in the West bank town of Ramallah, 28 May 2015.
