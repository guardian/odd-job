Although they are observed across the far north, white nights have the strongest association with St Petersburg, the northernmost city with a population of more than 1 million and Russia’s unofficial cultural capital. </p> \n<p>For the city’s Muslim population, it’s an exacting time. The Qur’an makes exceptions to the Ramadan fast for people suffering from illness, travellers and women who are menstruating or pregnant. But it does not give explicit instructions on observing the fast in the far north.</p> \n<p>According to some St Petersburg Muslim authorities, the long-lasting daylight in the city at this time of year is simply an extra challenge to their faith.</p> \n<p>“In St Petersburg, Muslims see this as a test. In the time that is now starting they will observe the fast,” said an employee of the St Petersburg and Northwest Regional Muslim Spiritual Centre, who declined to give his name. “Those Muslims who are observing the fast will wait 21-22 hours to break the fast, they will eat for only three hours.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b97cbe208aa31ae45ffbc7a9c9da208ef11c5807\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434551359426/3481da79-050f-4e99-a240-4e5cadae2fa2-460x356.jpeg\" alt=\"Muslims pray at the main mosque in St Petersburg\" width=\"460\" height=\"356\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Muslims pray at the main mosque in St Petersburg.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When asked about the difficulty of keeping to this strict schedule, he said it was no burden for the faithful. “Islam is a way of life,” he said. “For us, fasting is the same as getting up in the morning and brushing your teeth.”</p> \n<p>Yelizaveta Izmailova, an administrator at a local school who is originally from the largely Muslim region of Ingushetia, said her parents, brother, sister and husband all observed the Ramadan fast with her, following a schedule handed out each week at the central mosque.</p> \n<p>“This month, the time for breaking the fast is really late. We don’t eat or drink from the morning prayer, at about two in the morning, until the sun goes down at around 10pm,” Izmailova said, explaining that twilight typically arrived as late as 10.30pm in June. “Of course, this is a heavy burden for the human body, but every Muslim makes this choice consciously.”</p> \n<p>Although there are no exact figures on how many Muslims live in St Petersburg, last year’s Eid al-Fitr festivities, which mark the end of Ramadan fasting, drew 42,000 worshippers to the city’s two main mosques, according to the interior ministry. As often happens on major holidays, most could not fit inside and had to take part from the street.</p> \n<p>Some Muslim scholars have written that residents of northern regions can forgo the fasting ritual, which is meant as a way to strengthen the will and rule over desires.</p> \n<p>“According to the instructions of the Holy Qur’an, fasting in regions [near the poles] is never obligatory, for it is established as such only for a set amount of days, that is, in those places where night and day are comparable in length,” Russian Tatar scholar Musa Bigiev wrote in a <a href=\"http://www.idmedina.ru/books/history_culture/ramazan/1/longdays.htm\">text on fasting</a>. </p> \n<p>Other religious literature suggests that Muslims living in the far north can observe the Ramadan fast according to the time of sunrise and sunset in Mecca or the nearest Muslim city.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I have a hard job, I can’t observe it … There aren’t any white nights where [most] Muslims live.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In many cases, those performing hard manual labour don’t fast for safety reasons. Many of the Muslims in St Petersburg are migrants from former Soviet republics in central Asia and the Caucasus working in construction and other low-wage industries.

The US, two years after pulling all its armour out of Europe, is <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-33131886\">preparing to send 250 tanks</a>, armoured vehicles and artillery to bases in eastern Europe.</p> \n<p>On Wednesday journalists from around the world were invited to witness Natio’s elaborate exercise in the Baltic. The US-led alliance wants to show that it is doing something, that it is not feeble in the confrontation with Putin. Fallon, when asked about Baltops, said: “It is absolutely not a game.” Asked whether it was provocative to be conducting such exercises so close to Russia, he told the Guardian: “It is not Nato threatening Russia. This is Russia directly trying to intimidate the eastern and northern members of Nato through these flights, through its submarine activity and talk of renewing its ballistic missiles. Nato is not threatening anyone.</p> \n<p>“Nato has no quarrel with the Russian people. We do have a quarrel with Putin, or Russia, trying to change borders by force.”</p> \n<p>Asked about the danger of a renewed arms race in light of Putin’s pledge on ballistic missiles – though Russia is talking about updating existing missiles rather than adding more – Fallon said: “Russia is clearly modernising its nuclear defence as well as its conventional arms. Nato likewise is committed to increasing defence spending and increasing the percentage of defence spending that goes on new equipment. Nato is ready to match this kind of sabre-rattling from Russia.”<br /></p> \n<p>In recent days, Russian planes have been buzzing low over Nato ships, one just 500ft above the destroyer USS Jason Dunham, according to the US defence department. On Wednesday, Eurofighter Typhoons based in Estonia intercepted Russian military aircraft, bringing to 11 the number of interventions since they were deployed six weeks ago. Five of these have been in the last 10 days, coinciding with Baltops.</p> \n<p>A US naval officer reported that Russian ships, too, had come “uncomfortably close” – less than a mile from the Nato flotilla. It is in international waters and the Russians have as much right as Nato to be there.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/kaliningrad-map/giv-21277ag1OIVWqrhay/\" data-alt=\"baltic map\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/kaliningrad-map/giv-21277ag1OIVWqrhay/\">baltic map</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Lt Gen Ben Hodges, commander of the US army Europe, briefing journalists in London this week, said: “I am sure the Russians have no desire to go into a head-to-head fight with Nato. But what is a little worrisome is the airspace violations, without transponders, the big exercises right on the border. All of these things heighten the chance and risk of an accident or something unintended happening.”</p> \n<p>The response of Nato to the crisis in Ukraine has been feeble: there is no desire on the part of the US to go to war with Russia over a country that is not even a Nato member. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Nato has made a mistake lagging behind Russian moves. To recapture the initiative, it has to be more aggressive</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Igor Sutyagin</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But it wants to send a clear message to Russia that the Baltic states are Nato members and they will be defended. The increased frequency and size of Nato exercises in the Baltic are meant to send that message and Kaliningrad, Russia’s gateway to the west, is a good place to make the point.</p> \n<p>During the cold war, Kaliningrad was regularly described as the most militarised place on Earth. Afterwards, that started to change, but against the present crisis it has regained some of its former prominence, with about 50 vessels, almost the same number as those in the Nato exercise, stationed there. The US and the UK devote much of their intelligence capability to monitoring vessels going in and out.</p> \n<p>Hodges said: “One of the things that concerns me is the amount of capability that the Russians have put into Kaliningrad. They have the ability to deny access up into the Baltic Sea through anti-ship missiles. They recently did an exercise where they put in an Iskander missile there. That is a range of 300km, a nuclear-capable system which could easily range Riga.”</p> \n<p>The importance of Kaliningrad to Russia is that Russian ships from St Petersburg would be vulnerable passing between Estonia and Finland: Kaliningrad has no such vulnerability.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"83648c345d52cddf94dadd244ec8be5e38bc32b8\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/83648c345d52cddf94dadd244ec8be5e38bc32b8/0_339_3306_1984/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HMS Ocean as she leads ships of the Baltops fleet.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">HMS Ocean as she leads ships of the Baltops fleet.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: L(Phot) Luron Wright/MoD/Crown C/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Scandinavian and Baltic countries have reported an increase in Russian naval activity close to their waters, especially involving submarines. The Kremlin has responded by pointing to similar tests of its airspace by Nato planes, and exercises such as Baltops.</p> \n<p>Nato may say it is ready to match the Kremlin’s sabre-rattling, but reality is different from the rhetoric. The US is cutting back on defence spending and the size of its forces. A Jane’s report this week said Russia, suffering an economic downturn due partly to sanctions from the US and European nations, is scaling back plans for big rises in defence spending next year, but there will still be an increase. Even with that, Russia’s defence spending is dwarfed by that of the US, which is about 10 times bigger.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"618cccc7a804b17f3b005c71dbad8a69393fe325\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/618cccc7a804b17f3b005c71dbad8a69393fe325/88_128_2763_1658/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bristish defence secretary Michael Fallon watches the training exercise from the beach.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bristish defence secretary Michael Fallon watches the training exercise from the beach.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adam Warzawa/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Igor Sutyagin, a Russian military specialist at London’s Royal United Services Institute, said the standoff in the Baltics is complicated, with both sides using exercises to send messages. “For Nato, the message is: ‘We will defend the Baltic states, don’t mess with us, we will defend our interests, we mean business,’” he said. “The messages have become more confrontational.</p> \n<p>“Nato has made a mistake lagging behind Russian moves. To recapture the initiative, it has to be more aggressive. That is why it is confrontational. It is that Nato recognises that it is necessary to regain dominance and that means being more aggressive than its opponent. It is dangerous.”</p> \n<p>One of the contentious issues between Nato and Russia is a pact not to have permanent bases in eastern Europe. Nato has tried to get around this by stationing “rotational” troops in the Baltic states and Poland. They are there all-year round but Nato claims they are not permanent. Russia views this as semantics. </p> \n<p>“Russia would be left with no other option but to boost its troops and forces on the western flank,” said Gen Yuri Yakubov, responding to US plans for increased troops and equipment in eastern Europe.

Equally enormous is the public interest in an independent criminal procedure,” Lauber said. “Our investigation is of great complexity and quite substantial. To give you an example: The SAG [Swiss attorney general’s office] has seized around nine terabytes of data. So far, our investigative team has obtained evidence concerning 104 banking relations; be aware that every banking relation represents several bank accounts.”</p> \n<p>He warned there would be interviews of “all relevant people” and specifically did not rule out interviewing the Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who promised to step down in the wake of the US indictment, and the general secretary, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Valcke, who is under pressure over what he knew about a $10m payment from South Africa to the Caribbean that US prosecutors claimed was a bribe.</p> \n<p>At a press conference in Bern, Lauber said that Swiss banks had fulfilled their obligations to report suspicious banking activity and that the Swiss investigation had not been instigated as a result of the FBI investigation.</p> \n<p>The Swiss investigation into the controversial and chaotic World Cup bidding process – in which England lost out for the 2018 tournament and the US among the bidders for 2022 – was made public on the same day that US prosecutors alleged a “World Cup of fraud” stretching back two generations and dramatically arrested seven executives in Zurich.</p> \n<p>It has seized data and documents during two visits to Fifa’s headquarters and collected documents from Swiss marketing agency Kentaro relating to a friendly between Brazil and Argentina in Doha in 2010.</p> \n<p>Fifa argued that the Swiss investigation was as a result of it handing over documents relating to an investigation by its ethics committee chief, Michael Garcia, and that as such it was in fact the “injured party”.</p> \n<p>“For the time being Fifa is the injured party, that is true. They filed the report and this is the actual status as we conduct investigations against unknown persons,” said Lauber, but he warned that could change.</p> \n<p>“We didn’t start the investigation against Fifa. We started the investigations based on that [report] and based on a mutual legal assistance request from the US.”</p> \n<p>Asked whether the Swiss investigation, which is clearly already broader in scope than Garcia’s given the Swiss prosecutors’ ability to examine bank accounts, would tally with Fifa’s release of the full Garcia report Lauber said he was working to his own timetable and was not concerned about “collateral damage” elsewhere.</p> \n<p>“We are faced with a complex investigation with many international implications. The prosecution is ongoing and will take time,” he said. “It would not be professional to communicate at this moment a detailed timetable. The world of football needs to be patient. By its nature, this investigation will take more than the legendary 90 minutes.”</p> \n<p>Lauber, who said the “huge and complex” investigation could take months if not years in places, also emphasised that the Swiss process was independent from the US procedure and that they would not automatically share documents and information.</p> \n<p>A disputed summary version of Garcia’s investigation, which caused the US attorney to quit his post in frustration, raised question marks over Qatar’s bid but said that there was not sufficient evidence to strip it of the tournament.</p> \n<p>The summary, written by the German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, said that the Russian bid was unable to cooperate because it had returned its rented computers and lost all its emails.</p> \n<p>Under intense pressure, Fifa agreed to publish the Garcia report in full with redactions but has yet to do so while ethics cases against individuals are ongoing.</p> \n<p>Scala said last week in the wake of B<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/sepp-blatter-stands-by-promise-resign-fifa-president\" title=\"\">latter’s promise to step down</a> as Fifa president that a revote on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments remained a possibility.</p> \n<p>“If evidence should emerge that the awards to Qatar and Russia only came about thanks to bought votes then the awards could be invalidated,” said Scala, the independent chairman of Fifa’s audit and compliance committee, in an interview with the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung. “This evidence has not yet been brought forth.”</p> \n<p>Fifa’s chief ethics investigator Cornel Borbely, who took over after Garcia resigned in December, said he was prepared to widen the net if new evidence came to light.</p> \n<p>He said in a statement: “The independent investigatory chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee is carrying out several proceedings into football officials on suspicion of breach of the Fifa code of ethics based on the findings of the investigation into the decision for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.</p> \n<p>“Should new evidence come to light, the investigatory chamber will widen the group of suspects. The Investigatory Chamber has taken the necessary preparatory measures for this and is prepared to increase its staff numbers at any time if needed.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, the Asian Football Confederation’s general secretary, Alex Soosay, has tendered his resignation with immediate effect. Soosay was suspended last month amid allegations that he ordered a cover-up during an investigation into the organization in 2012.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434533486660/Swiss-Attorney-General-La-005.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber is surrounded by reporters in Bern after revealing his office is looking into a vast data haul from Fifa HQ.

But the surprise decision comes with a catch: whoever is chosen will have to share the honour with a man.<br /></p> \n<p>Treasury secretary Jack Lew announced the process of redesigning the $10 bill late on Wednesday – less than a week after a <a href=\"http://www.womenon20s.org/the_petition\">high-profile petition</a> was handed to Barack Obama calling on him to pick African-American slavery abolitionist Harriet Tubman.<br /></p> \n<p>The public campaign, which nominated the civil war heroine from a shortlist of 15 women, had suggested she replace president Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill.</p> \n<p>But officials have opted to redesign the $10 bill instead, currently occupied by the first treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton, and plan a <a href=\"http://www.thenew10.treasury.gov\">public consultation exercise</a> of their own before making a final decision on who should be the new woman on the note later this year.</p> \n<p>Lew also revealed that when the first new bills are printed in 2020 – coinciding with the 100th anniversary of American women receiving the right to vote – they are likely to continue to feature Hamilton: either by also incorporating him in the new design, or by producing several versions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\"

important to me to make sure that as we make this decision we continue to honour Alexander Hamilton who played such a formative role in the creation our country, the establishment of democracy as we know it and the principle of the soundness of our currency,” Lew told reporters.</p> \n<p>Nonetheless, the administration insists its surprise announcement is a “historic decision” in the normally conservative world of US currency production.</p> \n<p>There are notes with a face value of $1.3tn in circulation around the world and more than a billion $10 notes alone are printed each year.</p> \n<p>“With such a wide reach America’s currency makes a statement about who we are and what we stand for as a nation,” said the treasury secretary.</p> \n<p>He also paid tribute to the <a href=\"http://www.womenon20s.org/\">campaign</a>, which he said was as a “happy coincidence” with a separate decision to redesign the $10 bill to introduce new security features.</p> \n<p>“The Women on 20s campaign reflects the best tradition of American democracy where people care about something, band together and express their views,” said Lew.</p> \n<p>The theme of the next series of notes will “focus on celebrating a champion for our inclusive democracy”, said Lew – a criteria that may favour Tubman, who famously organised the “underground railroad” to smuggle slaves out of the south during the American civil war.</p> \n<p>But if the <a href=\"http://www.womenon20s.org/meet_the_winner\">three rounds of informal voting</a> carried out by Womenon20s.org are indicative, the choice is likely to be a complex one with strong historical claims made for Eleanor Roosevelt and suffrage campaigner Susan B Anthony.</p> \n<p>Anthony was also the first woman to feature on American coins after Jimmy Carter introduced a shortlived $1 coin in 1978.</p> \n<p>Martha Washington, wife of the first US president, was on a dollar silver certificate in circulation from 1891 to 1896 and the
