Last week, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/12/afghanistan-and-pakistan-thaw-relations-with-pledge-to-fight-terrorism-together\">Pakistan’s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, travelled to Kabul</a> to deliver an unprecedented public rebuke to the Taliban, which is engaged in a brutal summer campaign of violence. <br /></p> \n<p>But with the number of attacks soaring, the diplomatic achievements have not been enough to appease Ghani’s critics. On Monday, a senior member of the Afghan parliament ordered the international relations committee to summon NDS officials for a grilling over the intelligence-sharing deal.</p> \n<p>The immediate backlash highlights the difficult balance Ghani has to strike between pushing for peace and sustaining public support for his government. “We all know these daily attacks, the suicide bombers, the terrorists are coming from Pakistan,” said Haroun Mir, a Kabul analyst. “Suddenly we want to share something we don’t share with very close allies with a government we blame for every single attack.”</p> \n<p>Highlighting its extreme sensitivity, the Afghan government did not formally announce the intelligence-sharing deal and denied that Pakistan will train and equip Afghan officers. Leaks to the Afghan media said that the NDS chief, Rahmatullah Nabil, was against the move. </p> \n<p>The memorandum of understanding was signed by a deputy NDS director general after Nabil refused to sign, said Davood Moradian, a Kabul-based analyst and ex-aide to Afghanistan’s former national security adviser.<br /></p> \n<p>“This was an initiative proposed by the British but the NDS chief refused to sign it despite enormous pressure,” Moradian said. “It has not only heavily damaged morale within NDS but further damaged the credibility of Ghani and the national unity government.”<br /></p> \n<p>Following the uproar, Ajmal Obaid Abidy, spokesman for Ghani, attempted to play down its significance, saying other memorandums had been signed with the ISI in the past, but he did not say what areas they covered.<br /></p> \n<p>Opponents of Ghani’s strategy say Nabil and other top intelligence officials have been sidelined by the president and Hanif Atmar, his national security adviser.<br /></p> \n<p>One former Karzai-era official said many in Kabul were shocked to learn that Nabil was excluded from at least one key meeting between Ghani and the ISI chief, Rizwan Akhtar in the last year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f81b4bb9616a91dc16f082e544f59bb1736090e5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432020640657/fb1bbd9a-9eb2-4239-84c1-1cd8f619f4a0-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Rahmatullah Nabil.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rahmatullah Nabil, the NDS chief, refused to sign the memorandum of understanding with Pakistan’s ISI.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: S Sabawoon/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pakistan has long-pushed for Nabil to be sacked after it emerged the NDS under his watch attempted to recruit Latif Mehsud, then the second most important commander in the Pakistani Taliban, as an intelligence source.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/world/asia/afghan-spy-chief-defies-simple-label.html?_r=0\">Nabil later said the operation to cultivate Mehsud</a> was a bid “to send a message to Pakistan that if they can do this, we also can do it.” </p> \n<p>Pakistan insists it is trying to push the Taliban – a movement it helped to power in the mid-1990s and continued to support after 2001 – towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict.</p> \n<p>“Unfortunately there is a group [in the NDS] who do not want us to move forward,” said a Pakistani intelligence official. “They have benefited from all the money that has come to this region and they are not interested in peace.”<br /></p> \n<p>Amrullah Saleh, the NDS director general from 2004 to 2010, said he would have been ashamed to sign such an agreement and predicted staunch opposition to it. </p> \n<p>“I think a lot of us consider this a betrayal and a dishonouring of the sacrifices of our defence forces,” he said. “I never negotiated from a position of weakness.

In photographs of the arrests, men could be seen wearing uniforms of the Bandidos, Cossacks and Scimitars biker gangs.</p> \n<p>The Bandidos Motorcycle Club is considered one of the world’s largest biker gangs, with as many as 2,500 members in 13 countries, according to the US <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/criminal/ocgs/gangs/motorcycle.html\">Department of Justice</a>. They are second only to the more renowned Hells Angels in terms of their power, global reach and levels of violence. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e31d125fa1d3ac838839df473a00dafbd4aa68a9\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e31d125fa1d3ac838839df473a00dafbd4aa68a9/24_343_2176_1306/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Motorcycles remain at the scene of the shootout at the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco, Texas.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Motorcycles remain at the scene of the shootout at the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco, Texas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Waco police department/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In a 2014 gang threat assessment, the Texas department of public safety classified the group as a “<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.dps.texas.gov/director_staff/media_and_communications/2014/txGangThreatAssessment.pdf\">Tier 2 threat</a>”, the second highest. This gives the group a similar ranking to the Bloods, Crips and Aryan Brotherhood, who the report says are collectively “responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime across urban, suburban and rural areas of Texas”.</p> \n<p>The US DoJ considers the Bandidos – with their 900 US members belonging to roughly 93 chapters – to be a growing criminal threat to US law enforcement, as the gang continues to actively expand, by allowing supporting clubs and members to swear allegiance to the Bandidos mother club.</p> \n<p>According to Steve Cook, a Kansas City law enforcement officer who says he worked undercover in a motorcycle gang in the early 2000s, Texas is an emerging battleground for outlaw motorcycle gangs. </p> \n<p>“We were pretty certain that some kind of incident was on the horizon,” <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2015/5/17/8618899/waco-biker-gang-shooting\">Cook told Vox.</a> Cook, the executive director of the Midwest Outlaw Motorcycle Gang Investigators Association, is due to<a href=\"http://midwestomgia.org/Outlaw%20Motorcycle%20Gangs%20Waco%202015.pdf\"> hold a conference on Outlaw Motorcycle Gangs for local police </a>in Waco next month.</p> \n<p>The Bandidos originated in Texas, and have always been a Texas-based outfit, Sher said. According to Bandidos lore, the group was founded in March 1966 by Donald Chambers, a 36-year-old working on the docks in Houston, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/gangs-all-here?fullpage=1\">who grew bored of various Houston-area motorcycle clubs</a>. </p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.texasmonthly.com/story/gangs-all-here?fullpage=1\">one of his first recruits</a>, Chambers “wanted the badass bikers who cared about nothing except riding full time on their Harley-Davidsons. He wanted bikers who lived only for the open road. No rules, no bullshit, just the open road.”</p> \n<p>In the decades immediately after the second world war, motorcycle clubs and gangs were seen as an informal means for disaffected young men to combat war trauma and alienation from the countries they left behind, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ijms.nova.edu/November2005/IJMS_Artcl.Dulaney.html\">according to William L Dulaney in the International Journal of Motorcycle Studies</a>. </p> \n<p>Motorcycle clubs and biker gangs have been accused of flouting laws since at least 1947, when 4,000 motorcyclists flocked to Hollister, California, and were found to be drunk and disorderly, gaining national attention. The Hells Angels were founded one year later. </p> \n<p>The founding ethos of the gang may have been, “just the open road”, but the Bandidos have grown into one of the largest domestic crime syndicates in the US. Bandidos are involved in transporting and distributing cocaine and marijuana, according to the DoJ, and are involved in the production, transportation and distribution of methamphetamine. A <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/national-gang-report-2013\">2013 FBI report linked the Bandidos</a> to Los Zetas, the notorious Mexican cartel. </p> \n<p>The Waco shootout is but the latest in a long list of public violence involving biker gangs. Don Chambers was arrested in 1972 alongside two other Bandidos for killing two drug dealers in El Paso. He was sentenced to two consecutive life sentences, as part of a wave of imprisonments of bike gang leaders in the 1970s.</p> \n<p>But the past three decades have seen bursts of biker gang violence. Almost every major bike war involved the Bandidos. More than 160 people were killed over several years in the Quebec biker war of the late 1990s and 2000s, and in the Great Nordic war of the mid-1990s, in which Hells Angels fought Bandidos in Scandinavia, 12 people were killed and hundreds injured. A violent shootout in Australia, which came to be known as the Milperra Massacre, killed seven and wounded 28 near Sydney in 1984.</p> \n<p>The Waco incident will not tarnish their image, Sher said. It might even help bolster their recruitment. According to Sher, the Bandidos’ recruits, like other similar biker gangs, are young men (women are barred) in their 20s, who are mostly white and often racist. </p> \n<p>“If you join the Bandidos, even if you’re not a criminal, you’re going to be hanging out with criminals,” said Sher. “It’s a criminal network.”</p> \n<p>Though gang leaders routinely got arrested, biker gangs, unlike the mafia, did not have a pyramid structure, Sher said. “They have leaders but each chapter is very autonomous. The shooting won’t affect other chapters around the country or the world.” </p> \n<p>He added: “Bandidos are calling themselves bandits. They saw the Hells Angels as ‘too soft’. They are criminals and we should be taking people for what they are.” </p> \n<p>Sher decried a certain “romantic appeal” that seemingly imbues popular American perceptions of biker gangs, particularly in movies and television. From the 1953 Marlon Brandon film The Wild One to Sons of Anarchy, a hugely popular television show which centers on a California motorcycle club, motorcycle gangs have long been a part of the American cinematic landscape. </p> \n<p>“Bikers fit into the narrative of the ‘lovable outlaw’, the Clint Eastwood loner or rebel, the Easy Rider,” Sher said. “It’s a big part of the American tradition. Whereas in Europe and Canada, bikers are seen as criminals, in the US, they are seen as rebels who are occasionally involved in criminality.”</p> \n<p>But “biker gangs are America’s crime export to the world”, Sher said.</p> \n<p>The Bandidos did not immediately return a request for comment.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/12/16/1387172327507/Bandidos-011.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dean Lewins/AAP","altText":"Bandidos","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dean Lewins/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e31d125fa1d3ac838839df473a00dafbd4aa68a9/24_343_2176_1306/2176.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1306,"width":2176,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Motorcycles remain at the scene of the shootout at the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco, Texas.

The court granted bail on condition that she not leave Thailand without written permission. The next hearing was scheduled for 21 July.</p> \n<p>She is accused of criminal negligence over a populist rice subsidy scheme, which paid farmers in the rural Shinawatra heartland twice the market rate for their crop.<br /></p> \n<p>She is not accused of personal corruption but of failing to prevent alleged graft within the program, which cost Thailand billions of dollars and stirred protests against her elected government. The charge carries up to 10 years in jail.</p> \n<p>Thailand’s military-appointed parliament impeached Yingluck in January over the scheme, a move which banned her from politics for five years.<br /></p> \n<p>“I believe a hawkish faction in the old powers ... wants to punish the Shinawatras as much as they can,” Puangthong Pawakapan, a Thai politics expert at Chulalongkorn University, said. </p> \n<p>“But keeping her in prison will definitely anger the red shirts even more.” </p> \n<p>Other analysts say the mere threat of jail may be used to discourage the Shinawatras from re-engaging in politics.</p> \n<p>Yingluck has said the rice scheme “lifted the quality of life for rice farmers” in the poor north-east of a country where subsidies to farmers have long been a cornerstone of Thai politics.</p> \n<p>The army takeover last year was the latest twist in a decade of political turbulence that broadly pits a Bangkok-based elite, backed by parts of the military and judiciary, against poor urban and rural voters, particularly in the country’s north, who are fiercely loyal to the Shinawatras.</p> \n<p>Thaksin was toppled by a coup in 2006 and now lives abroad to avoid jail on a corruption charge. </p> \n<p>The former PM was in Seoul, South Korea, at a conference on Tuesday and said he had no plans to mobilise his “red shirt” supporters. But he called the first year of the junta government which came to power in a coup “not so impressive”. </p> \n<p>He called on the Thai people not to resort to violence.</p> \n<p>“No, we want to see the government be a success, but it’s difficult, as you can imagine,” he said. “It’s not so impressive yet.</p> \n<p>“They have to work harder. They have to understand the world, and the mentality of the people who have been in democracy for many years. </p> \n<p>“I think democracy will prevail sooner or later, but we have to be patient, and we have to be peaceful. Don’t resort to any kind of violence.” </p> \n<p>The Shinawatras, or parties allied to them, have won every Thai election since 2001. But their opponents accuse them of cronyism, corruption and financially ruinous populist policies.</p> \n<p>As a result, they have faced two coups and the removal of three of their premiers by the Thai courts, while several deadly rounds of protest have rocked Bangkok and weighed on the Thai economy.</p> \n<p>Another former prime minister, Somchai Wongsawat, a brother-in-law to Yingluck and Thaksin, also faces criminal charges over a crackdown against anti-Shinawatra protesters in 2008.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d7331c69ca94b2c29587d274ead3584edc49dffc/0_159_2516_1510/2516.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1510,"width":2516,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Wallace Woon/EPA","altText":"epa04756035 Coup ousted Thai former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra (C) greets well-wishers and supporters as she arrives at the Supreme Court to face charges of corruption over a rice subsidy plan, in Bangkok, Thailand, 19 May 2015.

By early Monday, ministers and paramilitary leaders were mobilising Shia militias to travel from Baghdad to take on the estimated 400 Isis fighters now in control of the city. Such was the speed of events that the prospect of Shia fighters being sent to the predominantly Sunni Anbar province met with little hostility from Ramadi residents, who until this week had disavowed the role that militias had played in the fighting elsewhere in the country.</p> \n<p>“The ones to be blamed for this are the government and the local authorities in Ramadi,” said Saleh Eraqi, a police colonel who fled on Sunday after his brother was killed in the fighting. “The army don’t have the fighting spirit. They were there waiting for Isis to attack. They are poorly equipped comparing to Isis. We are fighting with guns and pistols while Isis have Humvees and IEDs and suicide bombers.</p> \n<p>“There are many Sunnis inside the city who want to fight Isis but they don’t have the weapons. Our only hope is that we can get real support from the Americans.”</p> \n<p>Eraqi said the Shia militias, known as Hashd al-Shaabi, or the popular mobilisation units, faced an enormous challenge in winning back the city as Isis members stream towards it from elsewhere in Anbar province.</p> \n<p>“The Hashd al-Shaabi can’t do it,” he said. “They will suffer huge losses. I saw Isis fighting; they were more than 250, most of them Iraqis with some foreigners, and they had support from sleeper cells inside the city. We fought them from 12 in the morning till 4pm but we almost ran out of weapons and had to withdraw.” </p> \n<p>Ramadi, which sits on both the Euphrates river and a highway connecting Baghdad to the Jordanian and Syrian borders, has been the centre of gravity in Anbar province throughout the past 12 years of war and insurrection. It was a hub for foreign fighters crossing from Syria from 2003-07 and, over the past year, it has been contested by government forces and militants who have crept towards the city from Iraq’s western deserts.</p> \n<p>Sunni tribal leaders were instrumental in protecting the city, just as they were in 2006 during a crucial phase of the US occupation in which Ramadi tribes rose up against the Islamic State of Iraq, an earlier incarnation of Isis, ousting the group from their midst with the support of US ground forces.</p> \n<p>But since then, some Sunni communities in Ramadi and Fallujah have been central to claims that Iraq’s post-US governments have pursued sectarian policies that benefit the majority Shias. <br /></p> \n<p>Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Bahari, a tribal leader whose members were involved in the battles at the weekend, said the loss of the city was a reflection of a decade of neglect both by the Shia-dominated central government and by exiled Sunni tribal leaders.</p> \n<p>“We are exhausted, we want security and to be able to walk in our streets,” he said. “We are tired, we want peace, we want to live, and the government is run by thieves and ignorant people. I know most of the decision-makers in Anbar who pretended to be tribal leaders. They used to be shoeless and now they own streets in Jordan. They are sitting outside Anbar in Baghdad, Irbil, Jordan or Dubai and deciding our future by [the messaging service] Viber.</p> \n<p>“We are not welcoming Hashd in our city. We won’t fight them if they enter, but we are emotionally against them. They are an ethnic militia who will treat us badly. </p> \n<p>“The Hashd al-Shaabi think they can win Ramadi as quickly they won Salaheddine [the province surrounding Tikrit] but that’s a lie because Salaheddine is small compared to Ramadi. It was surrounded by other areas which they had already won, while Ramadi is a big city and is surrounded by desert.” </p> \n<p>Shia militias led government troops in a successful battle to reclaim Saddam Hussein’s home town of Tikrit in late March.</p> \n<p>Along the way, though, the militias have faced persistent claims that some members have pursued sectarian agendas and committed abuses against some Sunni communities. While Hashd al-Shabi has struck alliances with some Sunni tribes near Tikrit, it is distrusted by Sunni residents in Diyyala province, north of Baghdad, who claim its fighters are answerable to no state authority. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/mar/26/final-battle-for-tikrit-iraq-shia-militias-americans-glory\">Final battle for Tikrit: ‘We won’t let the Americans take the glory’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Hakim Zamili, a member of the Iraqi parliament’s defence committee and leader of the Salam Brigades, a Shia militia, said other Anbar tribes had been more circumspect about militias being sent to replace the vanquished national army.<br /></p> \n<p>“I have just finished a meeting with the leaders of Hashd al-Shaabi, Iraqi generals and the defence minister and we have put a plan to coordinate the fighting in Ramadi,” he said. “I have received many requests from the tribe leaders in Anbar asking us to bring the Hashd al-Shaabi to defend them.”</p> \n<p>Ihsan Shimari, a Baghdad-based political analyst, said the fall of Ramadi was a wakeup call for Iraqi citizens who had been persuaded by the government that the campaign against Isis had been going well, especially since the reclaiming of Tikrit.</p> \n<p>“Iraqis are easily misled by their emotions and they used to believe in a quick victory, but now they are hit with a harsh reality in Ramadi,” he said. “Now they believe that the war against Isis will be long and difficult. It took them a long time to understand that brutal reality.</p> \n<p>The militias dwarf Iraq’s embattled security forces in number and influence. With resolute backing from Iran, they have led the war against Isis since June, regularly taking primacy over Iraqi forces, to whom they readily cede credit for most battlefield successes.</p> \n<p>“Hashd al-Shaabi … are stronger because they are ideological,” said Shimari. “They are better organised and some of their brigades even have better weapons than the Iraqi army.”</p> \n<p>Naim al-Ubaidi, a leader of Asaib ahl al-Haq, one of the militias that plays a leading role under the Hashd al-Shaabi banner, said: “The Iraqi government asked us last night to intervene and rescue the city. We know that decision came late and we warned [the prime minister, Haidar] al-Abadi that they won’t achieve victory without us, but we know that he was under pressure from the Americans to not let us be involved in this operation.</p> \n<p>“All the brigades are now gathering their elite fighters to go for the battle in Ramadi and we are expecting the rescue the city within few days. The fighting in Ramadi will be easier for us than the operations in Salaheddine because of the collaboration of the tribes.</p> \n<p>“Ramadi has fallen under the eyes of the Americans and they haven’t done anything. This isn’t like what happened in Irbil when the Americans intervened there and prevented the fall of Irbil at all costs. This tells us that Iraqis are the ones who should deal with their problems together and get united to fight their enemies.”</p> \n<p>The US military said it had carried out nine air strikes as Isis advanced and officials in Washington said they were confident that the city could be retaken with their ongoing air support.</p> \n<p>If so, that would almost certainly mean that the US would be flying in support of militia forces, rather than the national army. Asa’ib ahl al-Haq and the Jeish al-Mehdi, both strong allies of Iran, were two of the US military’s most formidable foes from 2006-11, accounting for more than 25% of its casualties, according to figures provided by Washington.</p> \n<p>The US relationship with Iraq’s Sunnis was at times equally fraught. However, it reached a high point in Anbar in 2007, when a grassroots revolt was amplified by an increased presence of US troops, which curbed violence drastically in Anbar. </p> \n<p>Sheik Saddon al-Eifan, from the town of Amriyat al-Fallujah, said: “We in Anbar need any help we can get to get rid of Isis. They are attacking every family who fought against them and seeking revenge from everyone. We are now between two bad choices but we prefer the Hashd, and once they kick out Isis from our city we will ask them to leave.</p> \n<p>“We need the Americans to intervene in our reconciliation like they did before in order to bring us together to fight Isis. We all want to fight but we don’t have faith in the Iraqi government and it will take a lot to make us believe in them again.”</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Mais al-Baya’a.</em></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431970035579/e2082e78-dbe0-4af7-8a32-6471a754a23d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AHMED ALI/EPA","altText":"Displaced Iraqis who were forced to flee their hometowns ahead of gains made by Islamic State militants in Ramadi.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AHMED ALI/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T17:55:32Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T23:20:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Martin Chulov","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/martin-chulov"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Iraq","Islamic State","World news","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"world/iraq","webTitle":"Iraq"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Martin Chulov","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/martin-chulov"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-456761605","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":63,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/18/150518Ramadi.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/18/150518Ramadi_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/18/1431945684107/KP_230201_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Iraqi troops flee Ramadi as militants move in - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Iraqi troops flee Ramadi as militants move in - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Iraqi troops flee Ramadi as militants move in - video"}}],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/18/shia-militias-ramadi-isis-anbar-iraq","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/492ce","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/18/shia-militias-ramadi-isis-anbar-iraq","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/18/shia-militias-ramadi-isis-anbar-iraq"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431970035579/e2082e78-dbe0-4af7-8a32-6471a754a23d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Displaced Iraqis who were forced to flee their hometowns ahead of gains made by Islamic State militants in Ramadi.
