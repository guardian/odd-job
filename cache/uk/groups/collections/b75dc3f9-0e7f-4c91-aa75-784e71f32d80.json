You just assume that things are going on,” she said.</p> \n<p>However, on the eve of the vote – which is likely to take place on Thursday or Friday – experts and pro-democracy lawmakers said the most likely outcome was the package’s defeat.</p> \n<p>“Initially, I thought that they would buckle, that the pan-democrats would not be able to hold to their vow of vetoing it. Now, increasingly, it looks like they do mean to hold the line on that,” said Pepper.</p> \n<p>Claudia Mo, a pro-democracy lawmaker, said: “I am 101% confident that the democrats in Hong Kong will veto this so-called political reform package. I have made a solemn promise that I will vote it down.”</p> \n<p>“We all know that keeping the status quo is not ideal but as of now it is the best thing to do,” Mo added. “We just want to make sure that things don’t get worse in Hong Kong.”</p> \n<p>But Tian Feilong, a law professor at Beijing’s Beihang University who has criticised the plan’s opponents, said the vote represented “the first time Hong Kong has a chance to achieve universal suffrage”.</p> \n<p>“At the moment, the odds for the package being voted through or voted down are 50/50,” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>Lee predicted a furious reaction if pro-democracy lawmakers “betrayed” their electorate by caving in to Beijing at the last minute.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>“After the ‘umbrella movement’, young people will certainly not accept this position,” he said. Asked whether there could be renewed large-scale protests, he said: “Of course. Of course. These young people will certainly not give up.”</p> \n<p>Nathan Law, the secretary general of the Hong Kong Federation of Students, told the Guardian a Beijing victory would “further radicalise” its opponents in the former colony.</p> \n<p>“There will be protest activities should the package voted through. There definitely will be protest activities,” said Law, whose group played a key role in last year’s demonstrations. “As for whether it would be another occupation, I don’t know yet.”</p> \n<p>Dozens of police surrounded Hong Kong’s government headquarters this week as the “special administrative region” braced itself for possible unrest.</p> \n<p>“If this so-called reform is really passed there will be riots in Hong Kong. It is going to be unthinkable,” said Mo. “So for the sake of stability let’s have it vetoed first and then we’ll move on from there.”</p> \n<p>Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s number two official, also warned of “violent protests”, <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1820650/hong-kongs-future-hinges-pan-democrats-vote-political-reform\">writing in the South China Morning Post</a>: “I urge all protesters to express their views calmly and peacefully.”</p> \n<p>However, Pepper played down the possibility of major upheaval. “There will be small protests like we’ve seen already, last week and the week before.

In return, Greece’s creditors – the ECB, European commission and the IMF – are demanding economic reforms.</p> \n<p> Responding to Tsipras’s statement that he would patiently wait for a call to resume talks, an EU official responded: “He may not have time for patience.” As Brussels considers how to cope with a Greek default, Berlin is said to be particularly exercised about the risks of social breakdown in Greece.</p> \n<p>Unnamed German government sources told Munich’s <a href=\"http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/griechenland-euro-laender-beschliessen-griechenland-notfallplan-1.2522183\">S&uuml;ddeutsche Zeitung</a> that an emergency summit on Greece could be convened in Brussels as early as Friday if the eurozone finance ministers fail to make a breakthrough on Thursday in Luxembourg. <br /></p> \n<p>The German sources warned of Greek banks being closed down and capital controls imposed over the weekend.

An hour and 20 minutes later and 3.2km (2 miles) away, a shark bit off the left arm of a 16-year-old boy above the elbow .</p> \n<p>Both had been swimming about 18m (20 yards) offshore, in waist-deep water.</p> \n<p>A shark expert says the best response after one of these extremely rare attacks is to temporarily close beaches that lack lifeguards. Local officials acknowledged Monday that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/15/north-carolina-shark-attacks-oak-island-response\">they did not make a concerted effort to warn people</a> up and down the town’s beaches until after the second attack.</p> \n<p>On Monday, most beachgoers near the spot where the first victim was attacked were staying in very shallow water or on the sand. Holly Helmig, of Raleigh, watched her six-year-old son bobbing on a boogie board in shin-deep water instead of splashing in the waves farther out. Her five-year-old daughter Zoe shovelled sand in a bucket next to her.</p> \n<p>“I feel bad for the shark but I think he’s hiding somewhere in the ocean,” Zoe said.</p> \n<p>Deputies saw a 2.1m (7ft) shark on Sunday in an area between the two places where the attacks happened, Sheriff John Ingram said. Sharks of that size are common along the coast, Oak Island town manager Tim Holloman said, and authorities are not trying to hunt one down.</p> \n<p>But safety officials scouted for sharks from boats and a helicopter on Monday. One was spotted on Monday morning, Holloman said.</p> \n<p>Recordings of emergency calls released on Monday include several people calling in each attack, some sounding nearly hysterical. The victims – a girl from Asheboro and a boy from Colorado Springs, Colorado – were bleeding heavily, and other beachgoers applied makeshift tourniquets.</p> \n<p>“His arm is gone!” said one upset caller near where the boy was attacked.</p> \n<p>Randy Giles was sitting on the sand with his fiancee, Schalane Wolford, when he heard the girl scream, and called the emergency dispatcher immediately, before she was carried to the beach.</p> \n<p>“At first I thought it was a jellyfish sting, but when [the man next to her] pulled her out of the water, she was bleeding and a lot of her arm was bit off, so I knew it was a shark,” Giles said.</p> \n<p>As people screamed to get out of the water, Giles said Wolford ran over to give the family her towels, and someone else used a cord from a boogie board as a tourniquet for the girl’s arm.</p> \n<p>After the second attack, town employees drove along beaches urging people to get out, but the instructions were voluntary and not mandatory. The town has no ordinance authorising officials to order the surf cleared even if sharks present a threat, Holloman said. As a result, they take their direction from a state law guaranteeing public access to beaches.</p> \n<p>Surgeons amputated the girl’s left arm below her elbow, and she has tissue damage to her lower left leg. The boy’s left arm was removed below his left shoulder. Both were in good condition on Monday at the New Hanover regional medical center in Wilmington, where Dr Borden Hooks operated on both victims.</p> \n<p>There were only 72 unprovoked shark attacks on humans around the world in 2014, including 52 in the U.S., according to the <a href=\"http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/isaf/2014Summary.html\">International Shark Attack File</a> at the Florida Museum of Natural History. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/feb/09/man-dies-shark-attack-ballina-nsw-north-coast\">Australia recorded five fatalities</a> from shark attacks in 2014.</p> \n<p>Shark researcher George Burgess, who oversees the database, said he was aware of only two other multiple shark attacks on the same beach in one day. “It may be that there are big schools of fish out in the surf zone that are attracting the sharks,” he said.</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d4c75cd29b28ee864b5435c6f60a3f95fb652cde/0_32_3216_1929/3216.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1929,"width":3216,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mike Spencer/AP","altText":"Jack Cross, 9, watches as a boat patrols the coastline near Ocean Crest Pier in Oak Island, N.C., Monday, June 15, 2015.

Further home games against Poland are scheduled for later this month.<br /></p> \n<p>Volleyball’s governing body, the FIVB, said it was monitoring the situation closely.

The FIVB said at the time that it would prevent Iran from hosting international championships for as long as it maintained its ban on female spectators.</p> \n<p>Ghavami was arrested in June 2014 after taking part in a protest with other activists in front of the Azadi complex, demanding to be allowed to watch a match between Iran and Italy.

She said women would in time be allowed into volleyball, basketball, handball and tennis stadiums but would still be barred from football, swimming and wrestling events.</p> \n<p>Almost 500 Iranian social activists wrote to the interior minister protesting at the ambiguities surrounding women’s attendance. Many fear that the authorities may avoid confrontation with the FIVB by allowing a limited number of family members and VIP female fans. Others fear that even that limited attendance may not be allowed.</p> \n<p>Hardliners have threatened that “blood” will be spilled if women attend the match on Friday. In a statement that circulated online, Iran’s diehard voluntary militia, known as Ummat Hezbollah, likened women’s attendance at sporting events to prostitution and claimed that it contradicted fatwas issued by the country’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. <br /></p> \n<p>The government’s spokesman has said the Hezbollah militia will not be allowed to stage a protest over women’s attendance. But the government does not necessarily have the power to stop them. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c202cf9a627919de82f2b3162da503e197165cfc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434381708803/1a982f71-4943-4a30-a125-d7de8dca1564-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Protest in Tehran\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iranian Islamists hold up a banner reading in Persian ‘We are against the planned permission for women to attend the stadiums’, in Tehran last week.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Asieh Amini, a women’s rights campaigner who was among the first group of women who protested against the ban on female spectators a decade ago, said the authorities were dodging the issue. “They might allow a small number of women to enter the stadium on Friday by giving them VIP tickets but that’s not what we’ve been looking for. Unfortunately, the government has not done enough,” she said.</p> \n<p>“The situation has got worse in recent years and hardliners have become more extreme on this matter but on the positive side, more people are aware of our cause now than ever before.”</p> \n<p>Until three years ago when the rules were tightened, small numbers of women were allowed to attend volleyball and basketball events. This month a limited number of women, mostly family members of players, were allowed to watch a basketball game in Tehran.</p> \n<p>Mohammadreza Davarzani, the head of Iran’s volleyball federation, warned recently that Tehran would be banned from hosting international games if it could not resolve the issue of female attendance. He said the decision to lift the ban was in the hands of the interior ministry rather than sports officials.</p> \n<p>The issue was the focus of a 2006 film, Offside, by the prominent director Jafar Panahi, who in 2010 was sentenced to six years in jail and banned from filmmaking for 20 years for “working against the Iranian system”. The film features a group of girls attempting to enter a stadium to watch a football World Cup qualifying match.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434381108259/532eb8cb-e24d-4eaa-9f42-9a6664fed8fa-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alexander Demianchuk/Reuters","altText":"Volleyball","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alexander Demianchuk/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434381603510/274ce6fa-7b3c-4762-9db1-aee6506de87e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ghoncheh Ghavami.
