A Los Angeles County judge rejected the defence’s request for a dismissal in a hearing on 7 July, in a a move described as “an outrage” by Knight’s lawyer.</p> \n<p>The former Death Row Records impresario was arrested in January and charged with murder, following an incident in which Knight ran over two men at a burger stand in Compton, California, following his attempt to visit the set of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/feb/10/nwa-biopic-film-straight-outta-compton-first-trailer\">Straight Outta Compton</a>, the NWA biopic. One of the victims, Terry Carter, died.</p> \n<p>Knight’s lawyer, Thomas Mesereau – the fourth he has employed since the case began – argued that the case should have been thrown out because the man who survived being run over, Cle “Bone” Sloan, refused to identify Knight at an earlier hearing. He also insisted that video evidence showed Knight was acting in self-defence, in fear of attack from Sloan.</p> \n<p>Judge Stephen A Marcus denied the request. He said Sloan’s refusal to identify Knight had been a case of a “recanting witness” – common in cases involving gang members or those who have previously had gang affiliations, in which witnesses are either fearful of retaliation or simply abiding by an informal code forbidding co-operation with police. Judge Marcus added that it was “very. very clear” that Knight was the driver captured in the video.</p> \n<p>A bail hearing has been set for 17 July. Knight is asking for a reduction in his $10m (&pound;6.5m) bail.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436339060485/be8979e7-eef4-4f17-8028-32957cedd2f5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Patrick T.

In May, the country’s prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, publicly assured Ghani that “the enemies of Afghanistan cannot be friends of Pakistan”. <br /></p> \n<p>That Tuesday’s talks were held in Pakistan and with the apparent support of the Taliban’s leadership could relieve some of the political pressure on the Afghan president, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/19/afghan-backlash-over-governments-security-deal-with-pakistan\">who has been severely criticised at home</a> for his attempts to cultivate Pakistan with a series of concessions that would have been unthinkable under his predecessor. <br /></p> \n<p>Analysts warn a deal with the Taliban may not end the bloodshed in Afghanistan given the movement is increasingly split, with a homegrown branch of Islamic State attracting defectors from other militant groups.<br /></p> \n<p>Taliban field commanders are also said to be resentful of political figures within the movement who do not share the hardships of the frontline.

Philip Hammond, the UK foreign secretary, said there was “clear will on both sides” to get the deal completed.</p> \n<p>The most divisive issue appeared to be the question of continuing the arms embargo and restrictions on technology that could be used for missiles, imposed in two UN security council resolutions in 2007 and 2010.</p> \n<p>“We have always said this would be one of the most sensitive issues and always clear it would be resolved at the end because it is a political issue,” a senior western diplomat said on Tuesday night. </p> \n<p>It is particularly sensitive because it split the six-nation group that is negotiating with Iran. Russia and China were in favour of ending the embargo when a new security council resolution was drawn up to incorporate any deal done in Vienna. But the US, UK, France and Germany remain insistent on keeping restrictions in place on arms sales and missile technology due to concerns that more arms flowing to the Middle East would only serve to fuel conflict in the region.</p> \n<p>The western diplomat said that the EU foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, was able to bridge the rifts on Monday. </p> \n<p>“Despite the different approaches we sometimes have, Ms Mogherini was able to bring them together, the group was very united,” the diplomat said, adding that when the six nations presented a united front on the issue to the head of the Iranian delegation, Mohammad Javad Zarif, on Monday night, it led to a stormy meeting.</p> \n<p>“There was no slamming of doors but it was a very heated exchange of views,” the diplomat said.</p> \n<p>Marie Harf, a US State Department spokeswoman, said on Tuesday that interim terms freezing Iran’s nuclear programme had been extended again, to Friday.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2015/jul/06/iranian-negotiator-deadline-what-deadline\">Iranian negotiator: deadline?

We’ve given ourselves a couple more days because we think it can be done,” a senior western diplomat said. </p> \n<p>The agreement is believed to cover about 20 pages of text and is spread across five annexes: on the scope of Iran’s nuclear programme, on sanctions, on future civil nuclear cooperation with Iran, on a joint commission that would monitor Iran’s procurement of nuclear technology, and on implementation of the overall deal.</p> \n<p>Some of the text remains in brackets, meaning it is yet to be agreed, and that bracketed text encompasses some of the most intractable issues.
