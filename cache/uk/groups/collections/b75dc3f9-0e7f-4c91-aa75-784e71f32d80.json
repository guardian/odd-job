Morsi and his colleagues were convicted of conspiring with Hamas, the Brotherhood’s Palestinian offshoot, whom judges decided had helped the prisoners leave jail in January 2011.</p> \n<p>The sentence is provisional until the government’s most senior Islamic cleric gives his opinion. A final decision is due on 2 June. Even if the execution is upheld, analysts doubt that the Egyptian regime will follow through with such a provocative act. In a separate espionage case on Saturday, Morsi was sentenced to life in prison and, in a third case last month, to 20 years for incitement to violence.</p> \n<p>The death sentence is nevertheless the latest salvo in a 23-month crackdown on Islamist and leftist groups that has seen thousands killed and tens of thousands imprisoned. Morsi’s supporters presented it as vengeance on the part of the regime, parts of which have reconstituted themselves under Morsi’s usurper and former defence chief, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi.</p> \n<p>Hoda Abdel Moneim, a senior official within the Brotherhood’s political wing, said those sentenced included two who died in 2008 and 2009, and a third who has been in jail in Israel for years. “They just want revenge,” she argued. “We are in a farce led by the military, facilitated by the corrupt media, and implemented by a corrupt judiciary.”</p> \n<p>One of those sentenced to death in absentia, the Brotherhood official Ahmed Ramy Elhofy, warned the west to expect a backlash. “All the world will pay for this death sentence, will pay for their silence about the sentence, and for betraying the principles of freedom and justice,” said Elhofy, who is now in exile.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/16/mohammed-morsi-sentenced-death-egyptian-court-former-president\">Mohamed Morsi sentenced to death by Egyptian court</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He added: “Put yourself in the place of the hundreds of families who are sure their sons are innocent, and who are now seeing them sentenced to death, and seeing the world letting them down. How will they look at the world, and at those talking about justice and human rights? Of course you will have a proportion of people who will veer off course. We don’t have control over their actions.”</p> \n<p>At the time of his alleged jailbreak in 2011, Morsi had been in prison for just a few days. He and other Muslim Brotherhood leaders were arbitrarily arrested after the start of the Egyptian uprising, as the Mubarak regime desperately tried to silence those organising demonstrations. Morsi’s supporters argue his subsequent escape was possible only because guards abandoned their posts following a change in tactics from central command. They point to a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3UHAT-2sTI\">phone call between Morsi and an al-Jazeera reporter</a> on the day of the alleged jailbreak, in which Morsi says: “We are telling the world: we will not flee. If there is an official in Egypt who wants to get in contact with us, we’re here, I’m here, the telephone is here. We will never run away. We are well and we will not hide.”</p> \n<p>Following the 2011 uprising, Morsi and his colleagues were not censured for leaving prison that day, and Morsi was even allowed to run for president in an election in which he narrowly defeated Mubarak’s last prime minister. A year later, in July 2013, the army capitalised on mounting public anger at his increasingly hardline actions and jailed him and his allies.</p> \n<p>The wave of nationalism that subsequently brought Sisi to the presidency has started to soften. But nevertheless many Egyptians are happy about Morsi’s predicament. Writing ahead of the verdict, Esmat el-Merghany, the head of a lawyer’s union, said: “Morsi betrayed the nation and is guilty of the ultimate treason because of his espionage for Qatar. It’s normal that he should get the death sentence for the crimes he committed against his people.”</p> \n<p>The verdict ends any hope of a pause in the crackdown against Islamists, argues Yasser El-Shimy, an Egyptian academic based at Boston University. “Morsi being an Islamist leader and a symbolic figure … has to be punished harshly in order to convey the unambiguous message to all Islamists and other activists that there is no going back to the pre-June 2013 democratic transition. Ultimately, if the verdict is carried out, it will push many Islamist youths further away from peaceful political participation, and make it virtually impossible to achieve political reconciliation in Egypt.”</p> \n<p>In a separate development, Morsi’s predecessor, Mubarak, is expected to be released from prison in the near future, four years after he was first interned following his ousting in 2011.</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Manu Abdo</em><br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431790697878/Former-president-Mohamed--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mohamed Abd El Ghany/Reuters","altText":"Egyptian former president Mohamed Morsi"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-16T17:46:23Z","lastModified":"2015-05-16T23:00:51Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Patrick Kingsley","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/30/1414679917584/Patrick-Kingsley-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/patrick-kingsley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Mohamed Morsi","World news","Abdel Fatah al-Sisi","Egypt","Middle East and North Africa","Africa","Muslim Brotherhood"],"tags":[{"id":"world/mohamed-morsi","webTitle":"Mohamed Morsi"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/abdel-fatah-al-sisi","webTitle":"Abdel Fatah al-Sisi"},{"id":"world/egypt","webTitle":"Egypt"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"world/muslim-brotherhood","webTitle":"Muslim Brotherhood"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Patrick Kingsley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/patrick-kingsley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/16/morsi-egypt-death-sentence-backlash","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49xay","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/16/morsi-egypt-death-sentence-backlash","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/16/morsi-egypt-death-sentence-backlash"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-456750630","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":64,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/16/150514morsidelce_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/16/150514morsidelce.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/16/1431776508107/KP_226562_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Mohammad Morsi sentenced to death - video ","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Mohammad Morsi sentenced to death - video ","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Mohammad Morsi sentenced to death - video "}}},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"Egypt"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Russia / Space rocket carrying Mexican satellite crashes in Siberia","rawTitle":"Space rocket carrying Mexican satellite crashes in Siberia","item":{"type":"article","id":"science/2015/may/17/russian-space-rocket-carrying-mexican-satellite-crashes-in-siberia","title":"Russian space rocket carrying Mexican satellite crashes in Siberia","trailText":"All launches of Proton-M carrier rockets of this type will be suspended, according to media reports","standFirst":"<p>All launches of Proton-M carrier rockets of this type will be suspended, according to media reports</p>","byline":"Reuters","body":"<p>A Russian Proton-M rocket carrying a Mexican satellite malfunctioned and crashed in Siberia soon after launch on Saturday, the latest in a series of mishaps for Russia’s space industry.<br /></p> \n<p> The third stage of the rocket carrying the MexSat-1 communications satellite suffered a problem about 500 seconds after launch from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Russian media quoted Russian space officials as saying.</p> \n<p> The cause of the accident, which meant the satellite was not put into orbit, was not immediately established.

His lack of profile led to speculation on Saturday among Iraqi officials and western diplomats in the region that the target of the raid may have been a more senior figure.</p> \n<p>“He was very close to Adnani,” said a Baghdad-based specialist on Isis, <a href=\"http://www.aawsat.net/author/h-alhashimi\">Hisham al-Hashimi</a>, referring to the chief spokesman of the group, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/sep/23/islamic-state-followers-urged-to-launch-attacks-against-australians\">Abu Mohammed al-Adnani</a>. “They were together often.”</p> \n<p>US defence officials said Sayyaf was an instrumental money man, who had raised money through gas and oil sales.

However, the Pentagon said Damascus had not been informed ahead of time. The US troops flew from Iraq, where a 3,000-strong US presence has returned to the country US forces left in 2011, in order to train and mentor Iraqi troops in the war against Isis.</p> \n<p>Asked on Saturday about the whereabouts of Umm Sayyaf, Warren, the Pentagon spokesman, added: “She is being held in a safe location inside Iraq.

an explosive under her clothes as she approached the station’s perimeter fence,” said witness Danbaba Nguru.</p> \n<p>The head of the local Sani Abacha hospital, doctor Garba Fika, said six bodies and 32 injured had arrived there, with one person dying after being admitted.</p> \n<p>The Damaturu bus station has been repeatedly targeted in a string of previous suicide attacks.</p> \n<p>“I was in the station when I saw the young girl arrive,” said bus driver Musbahu Lawan. “I think she noticed the guards checking people at the gates and she decided to detonate the explosives in the middle of the crowd outside the gates.”</p> \n<p>Nguru added: “The road leading to the gates is always full of small traders … I was lucky not to have been hit.”</p> \n<p>No claim of responsibility for the attack

in three months.</p> \n<p>“Even if 90% of our communities have been liberated, the war is not yet over,” Mustapha cautioned early on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Boko Haram’s six-year insurgency has claimed some 15,000 lives and displaced 1.5 million people.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431788511264/bbe795f7-fbf4-487f-8ee7-1d986a28e818-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Twitter","altText":"The

In kayaks, canoes, paddleboards and other vessels, they sent the message that Royal Dutch Shell should cancel its plan to drill in the Arctic Ocean.</p> \n<p>The “Paddle in Seattle” – a daylong, family friendly festival in a West Seattle park and an on-the-water protest by “Shell no” kayaktivists – was held only blocks from where Shell’s Polar Pioneer drilling rig is docked at the Port of Seattle’s Terminal 5. The brightly colored boats lined the grass as paddlers loaded gear while lights on the towering rig twinkled in the background.</p> \n<p>Once out on the water, kayakers gathered in formation and hoisted signs and banners that read: “Climate Justice”, “Oil-Free Future”, “Shell No, Seattle Draws The Line”, and “We can’t burn all the oil on the planet and still live on it”. Many had posters or red scarfs that had the Shell logo with crossed kayak paddles underneath – resembling the skull-and-crossbones image.</p> \n<p>Eric Day, with the Swinomish Indian Tribe, was one of many Native American paddlers who brought their canoes to the event. Drilling in the Arctic would hurt those who live off the land, he said.</p> \n<p>“This is our livelihood. We need to protect it for the crabbers, for the fishermen,” Day said. “We need to protect it for our children.”</p> \n<p>Annie Leonard, executive director of Greenpeace USA, said there is a long list of reasons why drilling in the Arctic is a bad idea. The focus should be on renewable energy in this time of climate change, not dirty fuels, she said.</p> \n<p>“Why would we invest in an energy source that scientists say is leading us to catastrophe?” Leonard said. Many also fear that an oil spill in such a delicate and remote region would be a disaster on many levels.</p> \n<p>Greg Huyler, a 51-year-old scuba diver from Yakima, Washington, stood on the sidewalk and shook his head in opposition to the event.</p> \n<p>“It’s a bunch of crap,” he said. “The problem is, all of these kayaks are petroleum products, and they’re going to gripe about drilling for oil. And 90% of them drove here in cars that use petroleum products.”</p> \n<p>India Briggs, a 14-year-old from Cle Elum, Washington, said she and her parents drove two hours to make their voices heard.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0cc6e1ab0c5eb01680ee293b149547fe172d1250\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431810380335/4ec18321-2452-4f3d-8306-f76f16b0f225-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"royal dutch shell protest seattle\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tlingit tribal member Nahaan plays music along with members of other tribes during demonstrations against Royal Dutch Shell on Saturday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Ryder/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I’m happy people want to join together to take a stand on climate change,” she said. Her father, Jim Briggs, added that drilling in the Arctic would be deeply disrespectful to the Inuit peoples who live in that region.</p> \n<p>Alli Harvey, Alaska representative for the Sierra Club’s Our Wild America campaign, said: “Science is as clear as day when it comes to drilling in the Arctic: the only safe place for these dirty fuels is in the ground.”</p> \n<p>At the center of the paddle protest was the “People’s Platform”, a 4,000-square-foot barge powered by renewable energy, said Jonathon Berman with the Sierra Club. The platform was used as a stage for speakers, a band and a tall screen that showed images of people expressing their opposition to Shell’s plans.</p> \n<p>Just a quarter-mile away from the Seacrest Marine Park sits the 400-foot long, 300-foot tall Polar Pioneer, the first of two oil drilling rigs that Royal Dutch Shell plans to use this summer as it explores for oil off Alaska’s northern coast. The second rig, the Noble Discoverer, arrived at the Port of Everett last week and is slated join the Polar Pioneer at the Port of Seattle’s Terminal 5 at a later date. Everett port spokeswoman Lisa Lefeber said on Friday that they expect the Noble Discoverer to be there for two to three weeks.</p> \n<p>The Arctic holds about 30% of the world’s undiscovered natural gas and 13% of its oil, according to Shell’s website.</p> \n<p>“This amounts to around 400 billion barrels of oil equivalent, 10 times the total oil and gas produced in the North Sea to date,” Shell’s site says. “Developing Arctic resources could be essential to securing energy supplies for the future, but it will mean balancing economic, environmental and social challenges.”</p> \n<p>The activists see it differently, however.</p> \n<p>The protesters say it’s critical that they take a stand “against dirty fossil fuel projects”. They want to put themselves on the front lines in the battle for Arctic oil.</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431810336697/172d256a-b077-4f3b-93f6-80ca37a36035-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Ryder/Getty Images","altText":"royal dutch shell seattle protest","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Ryder/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431810381718/4ec18321-2452-4f3d-8306-f76f16b0f225-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tlingit tribal member Nahaan plays music along with members of other tribes during demonstrations against Royal Dutch Shell on Saturday.
