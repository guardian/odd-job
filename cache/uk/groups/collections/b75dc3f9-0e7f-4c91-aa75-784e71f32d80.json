One worker, whose name was blacked out of the court filing, told Cook in a 2012 message that Apple managers “are required to treat ‘valued’ employees as criminals”.</p> \n<p> Cook forwarded it to senior retail and human resources executives with the query, “Is this true?”</p> \n<p> The court filing does not include what responses Cook received. An Apple representative could not immediately be reached for comment.</p> \n<p> In the lawsuit, plaintiffs Amanda Friekin and Dean Pelle alleged that “screenings” or bag searches, designed to discourage theft, were being conducted every time sales reps left the store, including for meal breaks. The lawsuit, filed in the US district court for the northern district of California, seeks class action status.</p> \n<p> A US supreme court ruling in December 2014, in a case involving an Amazon warehouse contractor, handed a victory to employers, ruling that companies do not have to pay employees for the time they spend undergoing security checks at the end of their shifts. </p> \n<p>The supreme court found that because the screening process was not a “principal activity” of the workers’ jobs, under a federal labour law it was not subject to compensation.</p> \n<p> In the 2012 email to Cook, with a subject line “Fearless feedback from Apple retail specialist”, the employee said Apple’s policy implied the company did not trust its workers.</p> \n<p> “These procedures are often performed in front of gawking customers,” the employee wrote, and added that workers deserved to be treated with the same respect shown to customers.</p> \n<p> Another email, sent by a retail worker in Beijing to Cook and other managers in 2013, said Apple treated its employees “as animals” and thieves. It said an emergency exit in the store was blocked by Apple products.</p> \n<p> Cook’s response to that email was not displayed in the court filing, although other Apple executives did discuss the bag search policy.</p> \n<p>“If it is simply a deterrent there has to be a more intelligent and respectful way to approach,” wrote Denise Young Smith, Apple’s vice-president of human resources.</p> \n<p> A hearing in the lawsuit is scheduled for 2 July.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e878100539384fc53e3134739df4f737446d0b07/0_0_4056_2437/4056.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2437,"width":4056,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kimihiro Hoshino/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"(FILES) The Apple logo is seen in this September 11, 2012 file photo at the Yerba Buena Center for Arts in San Francisco.

She has spent the last 10 months locked up as her case dragged on, held up by judicial staff strike action and administrative delays.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development-professionals-network/2015/may/01/nigeria-urged-to-act-as-child-bride-languishes-on-death-row\">Nigeria urged to act as child bride languishes on death row</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Speaking to the Guardian, Tasi’u’s lawyer, Hussaina Ibrahim from the <a href=\"http://www.fidafederation.org/\">International Federation of Women Lawyers</a> (FIDA), said her client has no hope of returning home, such was the publicity garnered by the case.</p> \n<p>With Ibrahim’s help, a foundation has taken on Tasi’u’s case and the hard work of returning her to normal life. The <a href=\"http://iwei-ng.org/\">Isa Wali Empowerment Initiative</a> which aims to get young girls into education, will support Tasi’u in the months to come. She will live with a foster family, for the foreseeable future. </p> \n<p>Maryam Uwais, a lawyer based in Nigeria who has been following the case contacted the Guardian to say she had spoken to Tasi’u shortly after her release, who is “overjoyed” at her new found freedom.</p> \n<p>“Apprehension, relief and then gratitude were emotions that were manifest today, upon the release of Wasila,” she said. </p> \n<p>“An entirely avoidable tragedy, leaving in its wake four dead men and a thoroughly traumatised little girl. Poison – the only feasible escape to freedom – devised from the wild imagination of a naive, depressed little girl caught up in a painful forced marriage to a much older man. A tough lesson for families, communities and a government that is still ambivalent about sanctioning the perpetrators of child marriage.”</p> \n<p>Ibrahim says her client, bubbly and full of life when she met her for the first time, has become more withdrawn, quiet and even depressed during her time in jail. Educational opportunities are limited in the prison in Kano city where she has been held, and to this day Tasi’u can neither read nor write.</p> \n<p>Throughout her trial, which was conducted in English meaning the defendant could not understand a word, Tasi’u was threatened with execution. Reporters in court described her struggling to control her emotions during proceedings, frequently breaking down in tears.</p> \n<p>In the weeks since Prosecutor Lamido Abba Soron-Dinki asked the high court in Gezawa, Kano state, to “terminate the case” of culpable homicide against Tasi’u in May, her visitation rights have been limited with even her family prevented from seeing her. Ibrahim’s lawyer has been stopped from taking her young teenage daughter to see Tasi’u, depriving the child of one of her few regular interactions with people her own age.</p> \n<p>“I think they were worried that she would try to escape,” said Ibrahim, when trying to offer an explanation for the cut in visiting rights, in the weeks after her release was first mooted.</p> \n<p>The case has drawn international condemnation from rights groups, who say the decision to pursue the death penalty against a teenager violates international law. Others have characterised Sani and Tasi’u’s relationship as one <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/27/wasilat-tasiu-death-sentence_n_6233832.html\">characterised by “systematic abuse”</a>.</p> \n<p>After a presentation was made to the court by Kano’s attorney general on Tuesday, calling for the defendant to be released, Judge Mohammed Yahaya agreed to drop the charges and allow Tasi’u to be free.</p> \n<p>In Nigeria, child marriage is common, despite national laws prohibiting it.</p> \n<p>The Child Rights Act, introduced in 2003, raised the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18, but the legislation has not been ratified by states in the Muslim-dominated north of the country where child marriage is common, with nearly half of girls married by the age of 15 and <a href=\"http://nigeria.unfpa.org/nigeirachild.html\">78%</a> by the time they hit 18. In the country as a whole, 7% of girls in the country are married before the age of 15, according to the charity Girls Not Brides.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development-professionals-network/2015/mar/11/the-tragedy-of-nigerias-child-brides\">Nigeria: Child brides facing death sentences a decade after child marriage prohibited</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Kano state government has agreed to offer compensation to Sani’s family, <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-05-21/nigerian-child-bride-rat-poison-murder-charge-dropped/6485458\">according to local reports</a>.</p> \n<p>The charity <a href=\"http://www.girlsnotbrides.org\">Girls Not Brides</a>, which has campaigned extensively on the issue of child marriage in Nigeria and beyond, issued this statement on Tasi’u’ release.</p> \n<p>“Wasila’s case reflects some of the impossible situations that child brides face.

The presidential visit underscores Russia’s cosy relationship with Italy at a time when Putin is otherwise being treated as a pariah on the world stage. Renzi even made some jokes about vodka – saying he hoped the two would not be drinking Russia’s national drink on an empty stomach – and football. </p> \n<p>Renzi noted that Russia would soon host a major international event – the 2018 World Cup – without making any reference to the scandal that has engulfed Fifa or the controversy over the selection of Russia as a host nation. <br /></p> \n<p>At a press conference after the meeting, Renzi said that even though different countries within <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/europe-news\">Europe</a> had “different ideas” about how the sanctions were reached, all of the EU was “in the same place”.

Binyamin Netanyahu, now prime minister for the fourth time, deployed his signature phase about living in a “tough neighbourhood.” But a cursory glance around the Arab world left even the hyperbole-prone Netanyahu, on that point at least, sounding like a master of understatement.<br /></p> \n<p> Israel’s strategic position has never been so good, argued one senior official – thanks to the diversions and divisions of the wars in Syria and Iraq, the jihadis of the Islamic State, collapse in Libya and conflict in Yemen. It has benefited too from the Egyptian military’s crushing of the Muslim Brotherhood and the squeeze on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Jordan has come though the Arab spring unreformed and maintains discreet but intimate security links with the Jewish state.</p> \n<p> Opposition by the Gulf states to the impending Iranian nuclear deal has added to this sense of comfort. Last week a senior Israeli and a senior Saudi even shared a platform in Washington to articulate their anxieties about the Islamic Republic. Israel has been hawkish – Netanyahu attracting ridicule for the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2012/sep/27/binyamin-netanyahu-cartoon-bomb-un\">cartoon bomb</a> he displayed at the UN; Arab critics have been more discreet. But both condemn Iranian backing for Hezbollah in Lebanon, Houthi rebels in Yemen and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza. Both are alarmed by Iran’s role in Iraq and are seeking compensation from Washington for Barack Obama’s tilt to Tehran. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2012/jul/17/israel-old-certainties-crumble\">Israel never believed</a> it would benefit from democratic change in the Arab world. In the age of rampaging sectarianism in the region, it stands with the Sunni autocracies. </p> \n<p> In military terms, Israel looks unassailable. Moshe Yaalon, the defence minister, said that Syria no longer posed a conventional threat – its chemical weapons arsenal neutralised after the 2013 attacks near Damascus. Hezbollah’s arsenal remains a danger – but the assessment is that it is too committed to Bashar al-Assad to risk another full-scale war with Israel. Still, a wargame at Herzliya featured Hezbollah launching a rocket salvo and Israel inflict massive destruction on Lebanon, and suffer hundreds of casualties at home in just a few days.</p> \n<p> Ministers and officials ranged far and wide across the region but mentioned the conflict in Israel’s backyard almost as an afterthought. Yaalon was pleased that the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank has its own parliament “so they don’t vote for the Knesset” and praised its cooperation on security. But he did not expect a peace agreement “in his lifetime.” (He is 65 and looks in robust health.) Netanyahu won a brief ripple of applause for declaring that he supported a two-state solution (after saying he did not on the eve of the March election). But he then went on to list all the reasons there is not going to be one. Ehud Barak, the former Labour prime minister, warned of being on a “slippery slope” towards a one-state solution. That means occupation past the half-century anniversary of the 1967 war.</p> \n<p> Herzliya is Israel’s annual strategic talkfest. In 2004 Ariel Sharon used it to announce unilateral “disengagement” from the Gaza Strip and a few small West Bank outposts, holding out the prospect of future withdrawals. Sharon’s illness, continuing settlement activity and Palestinian divisions blocked any progress since. Now, a year after Operation Protective Edge left 2,200 dead in Gaza. (Israelis have got into the habit of calling it “Hamastan”) - the same catastrophic scenario could easily be replayed.</p> \n<p> Netanyahu called on Mahmud Abbas to resume peace talks and complained that the Palestinian president had asked only for a freeze on settlements – as if that was deeply unreasonable rather than the issue at the very heart of his concerns. Abbas is vilified for trying to use international law and institutions to pressure Israel as an alternative to being locked into an endless “peace process” that never delivers and erodes his increasingly threadbare credibility. Ron Prosor, Israel’s UN ambassador, accused the Palestinians of “diplomatic terrorism” - a novel concept even for a seasoned practitioner of hasbara (Hebrew for PR/propaganda).</p> \n<p>If Netanyahu is prepared to make nice, however unconvincingly, his Likud colleagues are not: Tzipi Hotobely, his deputy as foreign minister, ruled out any concessions in “Judea and Samaria” and painted the landmark 1993 Oslo agreement between Israel and the PLO as an historic error. Increased Jewish immigration, she suggested, was the best way to deal with those pesky Palestinians.</p> \n<p>But the issue that really grabs Israelis across the political spectrum is the international movement for boycott, disinvestment and sanctions (BDS), now gathering momentum in Europe and the US. That was discussed in a Herzliya session entitled “Israel: Scapegoat or Culprit?” Demonisation and de-legitimisation were described as a<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/03/israel-brands-palestinian-boycott-strategic-threat-netanyahu\"> strategic threat</a> greater than Hezbollah missiles or Syrian tanks.</p> \n<p> Netanyahu’s line is that Israel is under attack “because of who we are” by a coalition of anti-semites, jihadis, leftists and the credulous who are applying the lessons of the campaign against apartheid in South Africa. Cooler conference heads suggested it is largely about “what we do” - especially maintaining the occupation and continuing Jewish settlement while blaming the Palestinians for not negotiating.</p> \n<p>Netanyahu’s improbable romance with the Saudis has led to talk of Israel finally responding to the 2002 Arab peace initiative. That offers the glittering prize of recognition by all Arab states in return for a just peace with the Palestinians. Yet the combination of regional mayhem and the most right-wing government in Israel’s history suggest it is not going to happen any time soon.</p> \n<p>Unlike the prime minister and his team, Labour Party and other centrist politicians queued up in Herzliya to urge a return to the idea of two states for two peoples – and not just to “manage” the deadly but unequal conflict between them. Heading off international pressure on Israel, observed Shlomo Avineri, a wise thinker and former foreign ministry official, needs far more than more effective hasbara.<br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433967941390/5388fc42-1c33-4936-8590-163f6ed8c3cb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu delivers a speech during the 15th Herzliya Conference on titled \"Israel in a turbulent Middle East\".","cleanCredit":"Photograph: JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-11T06:13:04Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T06:15:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Black","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ianblack"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Israel","Middle East and North Africa","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/israel","webTitle":"Israel"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian Black","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ianblack"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/11/israels-strategic-position-enhanced-by-chaos-of-arab-neighbourhood","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49yvj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/11/israels-strategic-position-enhanced-by-chaos-of-arab-neighbourhood","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2015/jun/11/israels-strategic-position-enhanced-by-chaos-of-arab-neighbourhood"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433967941390/5388fc42-1c33-4936-8590-163f6ed8c3cb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu delivers a speech during the 15th Herzliya conference entitled “Israel in a turbulent Middle East”.
