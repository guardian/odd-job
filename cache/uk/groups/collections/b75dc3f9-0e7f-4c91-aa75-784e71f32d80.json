It is expected to include many frequently cited offshore jurisdictions as well as some surprise additions and omissions.<br /></p> \n<p>Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for tax, will also announce a consultation on the extent to which big corporations’ most controversial tax arrangements should be made public — a key demand of many campaign groups. </p> \n<p>This move would include forcing country-by-country disclosures of business activities, as well as potentially insisting multinationals publish details of the bespoke rulings they have secured from individual tax authorities. <br /></p> \n<p>In March the European commission <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/mar/17/brussels-clampdown-will-force-states-to-come-clean-on-business-tax-deals\">set out plans</a> to force member states’ tax offices to share such tax rulings with one another privately to help combat avoidance. Campaigners want such arrangements — through which multinationals receive comfort about the tax treatment of their most controversial affairs — to be public. Corporate interests are expected to lobby hard against this level of transparency. <br /></p> \n<p>At the heart of European commission proposals on Wednesday will be an outline of rules to standardise the way multinationals’ taxable profits are apportioned between countries — a framework referred to in tax jargon as the “common consolidated corporate tax base”, or CCCTB.</p> \n<p>Despite being widely backed by tax policy technicians, however, CCCTB — an idea first put forward four years ago — remains politically incendiary because it is a harmonisation measure. As such, it is an anathema to Eurosceptics in the UK and elsewhere. </p> \n<p>At present, the rules determining where multinationals’ taxable profits arise across Europe are found in a bewildering maze of bilateral tax treaties between EU member states. This treaty network is failing woefully, unable to cope with the toxic mix of ever more aggressive corporate tax planning and increasingly accommodating member states using tax policy to compete for inward investment. </p> \n<p>Last year the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale\">LuxLeaks scandal</a> exposed the industrial scale on which Luxembourg was awarding confidential tax rulings to some of the world’s largest corporations, effectively rubber-stamping structures designed to artificially depress groups’ tax bills in other countries.</p> \n<p>Hundreds of companies saw their European tax antics exposed, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2014/dec/09/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-how-junckers-duchy-accommodated-skype-and-the-koch-empire\">including Skype</a>, financial trading house <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2014/nov/05/-sp-luxembourg-tax-files-tax-avoidance-industrial-scale\">Icap and drugs firm Shire</a>.</p> \n<p>In its defence, Luxembourg quickly pointed the finger at other jurisdictions — Belgium and Ireland among them — claiming they too offered attractive but confidential tax rulings in an effort to lure inward investment. Acknowledging as much, the commission in March admitted some member states had “contributed to, and encouraged, aggressive tax planning”.</p> \n<p>Last year the commission launched a series of competition probes into some of the highest-profile tax rulings offered by member states. Ongoing investigations are examining whether certain rulings — including those offered by Ireland to Apple, Luxembourg to Amazon and the Netherlands to Starbucks — were so generous as to constitute illegal state aid.</p> \n<p>Last month Treasury minister David Gauke appeared to get his rebuff to Moscovici in early, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c121ec2c-086f-11e5-b38c-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3dFVMPzSp\">telling the FT:</a> “The CCCTB has been around a very long time. It is a proposal still looking for a justification.” </p> \n<p>The commission wants to push through CCCTB next year, but it is aware of likely opposition from countries such as Ireland and the UK. In order to make the proposal more politically palatable, Brussels is expected to suggest that that the “consolidated” element of the proposal be delayed in the hope this will kill accusations of a Brussels power-grab. </p> \n<p>That would allow the officials to focus first on agreeing on a common methodology for apportioning taxable profits. Only later — and if there is the political appetite — would the commission look at a second phase, introducing single European tax returns for multinationals.</p> \n<p>Commission officials are expected to emphasise that CCCTB, which is strongly supported by France and Germany, is designed to override many aspects of existing tax treaties and make for more effective taxation across the EU. They will stress it is in no way an attempt by Brussels to impose restrictions on member states’ sovereign powers to set tax rates.</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e9918bf6a4cdb7f678d4910b336a53cb56d7fa92/0_0_3500_2099/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2099,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Francois Lenoir/Reuters","altText":"European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Pierre Moscovici addresses an economic seminar organised by the European Political Strategy Centre in Brussels, Belgium, June 4, 2015.

Providing services for refugees and internally displaced people was one of the biggest costs of last year’s violence.</p> \n<p>In 2014, the world spent 13.4% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on costs associated with violence, equivalent to the total economic output of Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Spain and the UK, according to the GPI. More than $3tn was poured into military spending.</p> \n<p>Syria kept its spot as the world’s least peaceful country. Libya, which has seen deepening sectarian conflict since the fall of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/muammar-gaddafi\">Muammar Gaddafi</a> in 2011, slipped more than any other country in the rankings over the past year, followed by Ukraine, Niger, Djibouti and South Sudan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Global peace index 2015.

This year’s index showed that 81 countries have become more peaceful in the past year, while 78 registered deepening violence.</p> \n<p>“We use the absence of violence or fear of violence as the definition of peace,” said Steve Killelea, the founder and executive chairman of the <a href=\"http://economicsandpeace.org/\">Institute for Economics and Peace</a> (IEP) thinktank, which produces the GPI. Internal and external measures of peacefulness are assessed by an expert panel against themes of militarisation, ongoing conflict and societal and safety measures.</p> \n<p>The 2015 index shows “an inequality in peace” – with the world’s most peaceful countries showing the most improvements in peacefulness, while the least peaceful countries descending into further violence, said Killelea.</p> \n<p>The biggest deteriorations in peace resulted from a rise in the number of refugees and in more deaths from internal conflicts. The number of deaths has increased from 50,000 in 2008 to 180,000 last year, Killelea said. </p> \n<p>But there were encouraging improvements in political stability, he said. Guinea-Bissau, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/mar/25/guinea-bissau-eu-restore-ties-elections-development-programme\">praised in March by the EU for restoring its constitution and holding elections</a>, showed the biggest improvement in this year’s index. Ivory Coast, Egypt, Tajikistan and Benin were among the most reformed countries.</p> \n<p>However, prolonged conflict continues to pose grave economic problems. The conflict in Syria, where a civil war has been raging for four years, was estimated to have absorbed 42% of the country’s GDP. Afghanistan spent 31% of its GDP on containing violence, while Iraq spent 30%.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Violence containment spending\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://d26adhsj11a4c2.cloudfront.net/NR74C/3/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"610\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Iceland came top of the 2015 index, followed by Denmark, Austria, New Zealand, Switzerland, Finland, Canada, Japan, Australia and the Czech Republic. The UK ranked 39th, eight spots better than last year. The US came in at 94th place, one spot above Saudi Arabia.
