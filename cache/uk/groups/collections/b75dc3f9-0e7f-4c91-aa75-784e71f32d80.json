put to death for complaining about Kim’s leadership, and four members of the Unhasu orchestra, also killed by firing squad.</p> \n<p>In April an organisation, Human Rights in North Korea, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/northkorea/11572789/Satellite-images-capture-North-Korea-executions-carried-out-with-anti-aircraft-guns.html\">released satellite images showing

The leading government figure was also quickly <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-25362732\">edited out of a state TV documentary, The Great Comrade</a>.</p> \n<p>Kim feared that Jang was building his own power base and wanted “to cow anyone who may think of opposing him”, said Foster-Carter. He described it as a high-risk leadership strategy as “removing a central stick is perilous: you never know which other pieces may fall.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/dec/12/north-korea-jang-song-thaek-executed\">Analyst Adam Cathcart</a> described Jang’s execution as “unprecedented”, and had an alarming sense of improvisation. According to Cathcart Kim family members had previously been dealt with more leniently.</p> \n<h2>Internal instability </h2> \n<p>Writing for the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-32716836\">BBC Michael Madden</a> says that Hyon’s brutal execution is the latest in a personnel shuffle which has plagued the upper echelons of North Korea’s military. </p> \n<p>Hyon was one of four minsters to hold the top defence post in the past four years. The rest faced less grisly fates, either being moved to a different post or retiring.</p> \n<p>Madden says the most likely explanation for Hyon’s death is an insecure Kim attempting to exert his power and authority: “ultimately, this is not the sign of a man confident in his job”. </p> \n<p>Whilst he doesn’t believe the country is likely to fold any time soon, Madden describes North Korea’s internal politics as “very volatile”. </p> \n<p>Earlier this month Kim was slated to join <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/15/moscow-defiant-victory-day-parade-european-kim-jong-un-9-may-russia-ukraine\">Russia’s Victory Day celebrations</a> in what would have been his first overseas trip but, as many analysts had predicted, the visit was cancelled. </p> \n<p><a href=\"https://theconversation.com/kim-jong-un-purges-paranoia-plots-and-the-beloved-leaders-cancelled-trip-to-moscow-41057\">Writing for the Conversation</a> Adam Cathcart said that, foreign travel aside, Kim does not even appear comfortable travelling outside Pyongyang, for fear of assassination attempts. </p> \n<p>Leading North Korea scholar <a href=\"http://www.nknews.org/2015/05/n-korean-defense-chief-hyon-yong-chol-executed-s-korean-intelligence/\">Andrei Lankov </a>has also said that if reports of Hyon’s execution are true, it should be seen as a sign of Kim trying to impose fear among the country’s leadership. </p> \n<p>“His age and because of his sudden promotion it is highly likely that most of those around him did not take him seriously, at least initially,” Lankov said, adding he was not yet convinced that a new wave of executions is actually taking place.<br /></p> \n<h2>Salacious rumours</h2> \n<p>Reports of executions, often based on single sources, are often impossible to independently verify, creating an information vacuum that allows rumour to spread quickly. </p> \n<p>In 2013 South Korean media claimed that nine Unhasu orchestra members were executed in a bid to preserve his wife’s reputation after appearing in a pornography video. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2012/oct/30/ri-sol-ju-pass-notes\">Ri Sol-ju </a>was a singer with the troupe before she married Kim. </p> \n<p>North Korea dismissed reports from South’s “reptile media” as attempts to tarnish the leadership’s image. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22148d8011be5b82369eeef4d87a495f8b761ec9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431516555410/b84aa984-8009-4728-8ee5-517797b50adc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ri Sol-ju\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kim’s wife Ri Sol-ju has been subject to her own execution rumours.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KCNA/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the light of the claims John Delury, an expert on North Korea, told the Guardian that whilst some claims are possibly true the normal standards of journalism are thrown out of the window: “It’s North Korea – no one knows what’s going on in there,” he said. <br /></p> \n<p>Other past unsubstantiated claims have included reports that Jang Song-thaek was put to death by being<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jan/06/story-kim-jong-un-uncle-fed-dogs-made-up\"> stripped naked and fed to a pack of starving dogs</a>.

Most of the 65 people confirmed dead by Wednesday morning were in Dolakha district, located north-east of Kathmandu, the district’s chief administrator, Prem Lal Lamichane, said.</p> \n<p>“People are terrorised. Everyone is scared here. They spent the night out in the open,” Lamichane said, adding the administration was running out of relief material.</p> \n<p>He asked the government to send more helicopters and supplies, and said there were many injured people stranded in villages.</p> \n<p>Tuesday’s quake injured nearly 2,000 people, according to the home ministry’s latest count.

The US Geological Survey (USGS) said Tuesday’s earthquake was the largest aftershock to date of that destructive quake.</p> \n<p>Impoverished Nepal appealed to foreign nations for billions of dollars in aid, as well as medical experts to treat the wounded and helicopters to ferry food and temporary shelters to hundreds of thousands left homeless amid unseasonal rains.</p> \n<p>Search parties fanned out to look for survivors in the wreckage of collapsed buildings in Sindhupalchowk’s town of Chautara, which had become a hub for humanitarian aid after April’s quake.</p> \n<p>In Washington, Navy Captain Chris Sims said the missing Huey helicopter was conducting disaster relief operations near Charikot, Nepal.</p> \n<p>A nearby Indian helicopter heard radio chatter about a possible fuel problem, said US Army Colonel Steve Warren. The Huey, carrying tarps and rice, had dropped off supplies and was headed to a second site when contact was lost, he said, adding that there has been no smoke or other signs of a crash.</p> \n<p>Due to the rugged terrain, the helicopter could have landed in an area where the crew was unable to get a beacon or radio signal out, Warren said.</p> \n<p>Tuesday’s quake was followed closely by at least 17 strong aftershocks, according to the USGS.</p> \n<p>Frightened residents in the capital, who had returned to their homes only a few days ago, had to again set up tents on Tuesday night to sleep in empty fields, parking lots and on sidewalks.</p> \n<p>Forty-year-old produce vendor Ram Hari Sah said: “Everyone was saying the earthquakes are over ... Now I don’t want to believe anyone.”</p> \n<p>Extra police were sent to patrol ad hoc camping areas, while drinking water and extra tents were being provided, according to Kathmandu administrator Ek Narayan Aryal. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, new landslides blocked mountain roads in the district of Gorkha, one of the regions hit hardest on 25 April, and previously damaged buildings collapsed with the latest quake.</p> \n<p>Residents of the small town of Namche Bazaar, about 50km from the epicentre of Tuesday’s quake and well known to high-altitude trekkers, said a couple of buildings damaged earlier had collapsed there as well. However, there were no reports of deaths or injuries.</p> \n<p>The earth also shook strongly in neighboring Tibet, unleashing a landslide that killed one person and injured three, according to China Central Television.
