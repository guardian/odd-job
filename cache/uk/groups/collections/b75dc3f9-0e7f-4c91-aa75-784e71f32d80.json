chancellor hosts meeting to announce plan for disease-response department after World Health Organisation’s slow Ebola operation</p>","byline":"Sarah Boseley Health editor","body":"<p>The decision to warn the world of future global disease epidemics like Ebola would be taken out of the hands of the director general of the World Health Organisation under plans formulated by experts at a meeting hosted by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. Instead it would be given to a new semi-autonomous body, within WHO but independent of its political currents.<br /></p> \n<p>Merkel will speak at the opening of the annual World Health Assembly in Geneva on Monday of the need for WHO reform to ensure there is prompt response to health emergencies that can impact on the entire world. There are two urgent issues that must be addressed in the interest of all nations, she believes – the response to the event of a pandemic and the fading powers of antibiotic drugs because of global overuse. She intends to push forward on both issues at the G7, which Germany chairs, in the summer.</p> \n<p>The WHO’s slow response to Ebola has been universally condemned. The director general’s committee – which can declare a public health emergency – was not convened until August, eight months after the first cases and five months after public warnings from M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res, whose doctors were on the front line. Experts believe the Ebola disaster was a wake-up call and that there is now an unprecedented opportunity to make changes to WHO to ensure this never happens again.</p> \n<p>There is now little appetite for replacing WHO, which was at first proposed by some critics. The meeting called by Merkel of world experts in Berlin some weeks ago instead believes that a dedicated group with its own ring-fenced funding and its own director should be established.

The Gulf Arab states fear that Tehran, boosted by the relaxation of economic sanctions, will try to expand and consolidate its “hegemonic” grip over the Middle East.</p> \n<p>According to this argument, Iranian hegemony will above all affect Iraq, where Tehran seeks to install a government in thrall to it, hindering the formation of a viable democratic system in its western neighbour. The <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-31917412\">domestic</a> and <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/05/us-iran-talks-gulf-idUSKBN0M10SH20150305\">foreign</a> exponents of this <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/19/irans-shiite-militias-are-running-amok-in-iraq/\">view</a> point to the growing power of Tehran-backed Shia groups fighting the so-called Islamic State (Isis) as <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/02/shiite-militias-mixed-blessing-iraq-syria.html\">proof</a> of attempts to plant an Iranian “deep state” in Iraq, allegedly similar to Hezbollah in Lebanon.</p> \n<p>Such concerns are legitimate but exaggerated and even misplaced. Iranian influence is unlikely to produce a state within the Iraqi state, even if some elements in Iran desire it. And this holds regardless of whether the nuclear negotiations are successful or not.</p> \n<p>Shia paramilitary forces are undoubtedly on the rise in Iraq, and this may intensify sectarian fault lines. David Petraeus, who commanded US troops in Iraq during 2007-2008, has voiced concerns over reports of sectarian atrocities committed by the Shia Popular Mobilization Units (al-Hashd al-Sha’bi or PMUs) as well as by Iraqi security forces.</p> \n<p>Human Rights Watch has <a href=\"http://features.hrw.org/features/HRW_2015_reports/Iraq_Amerli/index.html\">accused</a> the PMUs of looting and destroying Sunni Arabs’ property. Although PMU commanders have invariably <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeV2rezLWFQ\">condemned</a> these acts and promised to bring the perpetrators to justice, their recurrence is likely to exacerbate the chronic distrust between Sunni Arabs and the Shia groups that make up the security backbone of the central government in Baghdad.</p> \n<p>More worrying for Petraeus and many Arab politicians in the region, however, is the increasing influence of Iranian Revolutionary Guards - especially its overseas arm, the Quds Force - on which the bulk of PMU forces rely for logistical support and advice.</p> \n<p>“If Daesh [the Arabic acronym for Isis] is driven from Iraq and the consequence is that Iranian-backed militias emerge as the most powerful force in the country - eclipsing the Iraqi security forces, much as Hezbollah does in Lebanon - that would be a very harmful outcome for Iraqi stability and sovereignty, not to mention our own national interests in the region,” Petraeus warned in an <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2015/03/20/petraeus-the-islamic-state-isnt-our-biggest-problem-in-iraq/?tid=pm_pop\">interview</a> with The Washington Post. John Brennan, director of the CIA, has made <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/mar/22/leader-of-iranian-force-fighting-isis-is-complicating-us-efforts-says-cia-chief\">similar comments</a> about Iran’s “very aggressive and active” role in Iraq.</p> \n<p>But this is not the entire picture, and represents a skewed conception of the reality on the ground. There are significant factors in play that undermine prospects for the PMUs becoming a force operating on behalf of Tehran outside the jurisdiction of Baghdad. While most of Iraq’s Shia citizens might desire a prosperous and successful Iran next door, it would be an extraordinary stretch of imagination to claim they would favour turning their land into an Iranian satellite state.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/may/07/prayer-food-sex-and-water-parks-in-irans-holy-city-of-mashhad\">Prayer, food, sex and water parks in Iran's holy city of Mashhad</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The latest outburst of Iraqi nationalism vis-&agrave;-vis Iran came in response to controversial <a href=\"http://www.mehrnews.com/news/2514391/%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B2%D9%87%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D9%85%D8%A7-%D9%85%D8%B5%D9%86%D9%88%D8%B9%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA-%D9%88-%D9%86%D9%81%D9%88%D8%B0-%D9%81%D8%B1%D9%87%D9%86%DA%AF%DB%8C-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D8%A8%D8%B2%D8%B1%DA%AF%D8%AA%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D8%B2-%D8%A7%DB%8C%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%B2%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA\">comments</a> on Iranian-Iraqi relations from Ali Younesi, advisor to President Hassan Rouhani on ethnic minorities and a former intelligence minister. “Currently”, Younesi <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/iran-iraq-rouhani-advisor-empire.html#ixzz3UkHpxcOS\">said</a>, “Iraq is not only part of our civilisational influence, but it is our identity, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/may/07/prayer-food-sex-and-water-parks-in-irans-holy-city-of-mashhad\">culture</a>, centre and capital…Because Iran and Iraq’s geography and culture are inseparable, either we fight one another or we become one.”</p> \n<p>Younesi’s comments drew stringent <a href=\"http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2015/03/iran-iraq-rouhani-adviser-empire-younesi.html\">criticism</a> from Rouhani’s rivals in the Iranian parliament where 109 deputies signed a letter demanding his dismissal. Younesi was reportedly <a href=\"http://www.tasnimnews.com/Home/Single/690465\">summoned</a> to the Special Court for the Clergy, where he was questioned about “statements against national security” before being released on bail.</p> \n<p>But by suggesting an imperial belief in bringing Iraq into the orbit of Iranian civilization, Younesi set off a massive backlash in Iraq not only from Sunni Arab groups and personalities, but also from Shias. Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, the most revered Shia cleric in Iraq, was one who stepped forward in defence of Iraqi autonomy and sovereignty.</p> \n<p>“We are proud of our country and our identity and our independence and sovereignty,” <a href=\"http://www.nawaret.com/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%A9/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8%D9%8A/%D9%85%D9%85%D8%AB%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%B1\">said</a> Ahmad al-Saafi, Sistani’s representative, in apparent response to Younesi’s remarks. “While we welcome any help offered today from our brothers and friends in our fight against the terrorists and thank them for that, this doesn’t mean in any way that we would ignore our identity and independence.”</p> \n<p>In their fight against Isis, Shia paramilitary forces derive their religious legitimacy primarily from Sistani as their chief “source of emulation” and from his fatwa, issued after the group’s takeover of Mosul in June 2014, calling on all able Iraqis to take up arms. Ever since, Sistani has consistently maintained that volunteers must operate under Iraqi state command.</p> \n<p>By the same token, the PMUs are at the moment organised by a committee affiliated with the Iraqi <a href=\"http://www.nsa.gov.iq/\">National Security Advisory</a> (NSA), which is accountable to the prime minister, Haidar al-Abadi. It is hard to believe that all PMU actions and moves are under the scrutiny of Baghdad, but the Iraqi government does maintain a degree of control, providing their salaries and fighting equipment <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=1577337925883553&amp;set=vb.1511508895799790&amp;type=2&amp;theater\">according to</a> the defence minister, Khaled al-Obaidi.</p> \n<p>This goes some way to meet demands from Sunnis for the “<a href=\"http://www.c-span.org/video/?325956-1/discussion-future-iraq\">institutionalisation</a>” of PMUs as a means to bring them under state control. The former deputy prime minister and leading Sunni Arab Rafe al-Issawi, for example, said recently at the Brookings Institution in Washington that “some of the militias...[are] out of the total control of the central government...[and] without institutionalisation of paramilitary forces...there will be much more discontent”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/mar/17/iran-viewed-from-iraq-fight-against-isis\">What do Iraqis think of Iran?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Given the strength of nationalist sentiment across all Iraqi sects and the broad-based recognition of Sistani as a force for national unity, it will be difficult for Shia PMU groups to form a quasi-state in parallel to the Iraqi government once Isis is dislodged. In the eventuality of such a political outgrowth, the PMUs are bound to lose Sistani’s backing, and with it their legitimacy in the eyes of millions of Iraqi Shias who currently support them.</p> \n<p>Moreover, PMU leaders and military commanders have so far shown little interest in taking that path. Hadi al-Ameri, the head of Badr Organisation, a long-standing Shia group with close ties to Iranian Revolutionary Guards, envisions a future for PMUs where the Iraqi state has the final say. “After Sayyed Sistani’s fatwa, we were left with no choice but to take up arms and fight,” he told al-Sumaria TV. “These are, however, the state’s arms. The Badr Organization doesn’t possess any weapons.”</p> \n<p>In a similar vein, Qais al-Khazali, leader of Asaib Ahl al-Haq – another paramilitary Shia group with sympathies towards Iran – stressed during an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phW9QwC61mI\">interview</a> with al-Ahd television that PMUs were “national factions for sure...part of the Iraqi state institutions, and committed to the decisions of the commander-in-chief [the Iraqi prime minister]”.</p> \n<p>While seeing Iran as their major source of strategic depth, Iraqi Shias are reluctant to lose their majority position in the Iraqi state by creating a paramilitary force operating in parallel to the central government. Shia leaders understand these dynamics well, with a consensus emerging that a new National Guard will absorb the PMUs once Isis is done with and Ayatollah Sistani’s fatwa expires.</p> \n<p>The National Guard is supposed to recruit locally and fall partly under the command of the elected local governments, mainly to assure the Sunni Arabs they will be included in running security. Both Shia and Sunni groups in Iraq are generally driven by a strong sense of nationalism and look forward to the rise of Iraq - given its strategic position, cultural heritage and natural resources - as a regional power on a par with Iran and Saudi Arabia. This is a promising cause that can soften and mature factional politics.</p> \n<p><em>Hamdi Malik is a PhD student of sociology at Keele university, UK, and a frequent contributor to BBC Persian TV programmes.

To make the symbolism even clearer, they then built their glass and bronze parliament squarely on top of the palace ruins.

The project has also garnered praise from its harshest critics after one of its directors publicly committed to making the museum the first in Germany to address the country’s atrocities in its erstwhile colonies in Africa and Asia.</p> \n<p>“Because of the second world war and the Holocaust, we completely forgot that Germany also has a colonial history,” said Hermann Parzinger, president of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation and a member of the triumvirate. “We don’t want to make a museum like the Mus&eacute;e du quai Branly in Paris, where colonialism is absent completely. Germany’s colonial history is short, but in these few years, terrible things happened.” </p> \n<p>Germany’s forays abroad started in 1884, when the major European powers met in Berlin to carve up Africa. Like neighbouring European powers, its colonial conquest was brutal. One of the lowest points entailed a campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Nama and Herero peoples carried out by German troops in their erstwhile colony, Namibia. German scholars say this act was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/18/pope-francis-armenian-genocide-first-20th-century-namibia\">the first genocide of the 20th century</a>. They accuse the German government of airbrushing it from museums and high-school textbooks, and of downplaying its links to the Holocaust 30 years later. </p> \n<p>“Our colonial period was three times as long as the Third Reich,” said historian J&uuml;rgen Zimmerer of the University of Hamburg. “But Germans have been reluctant to look at colonial history and, in particular, the Namibian genocide – even though, perversely, we are <a href=\"http://time.com/3834015/armenian-genocide-german-president-turkey/\">pushing Turkey to acknowledge their genocide.”</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0cdc8f3056be46394c12de44d04835a5a39d489\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431605096886/d9be6f78-9e95-4724-b061-7ad50543a2d7-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"View of the Palace of the Republic\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">View of the Palace of the Republic in east Berlin during the tenth party convention of the GDR’s Socialist Unity party in 1981.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Associated Press</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The latest plan – including the colonial history component, and securing MacGregor for a two-year term – was seen to have helped to improve the image of a project that had been <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/arts/design/01abroad.html\">roundly panned </a>by critics here and abroad. </p> \n<p>This latest scheme will see the institution build its core attraction around ethnological artefacts currently stored in museums in Berlin’s Dahlem neighbourhood. The palace will also host historically exact copies of some of the Kaiser’s rooms, as well as a Berlin history museum, multipurpose conference rooms and part of the Humboldt University’s art collection. </p> \n<p>As for the logistics of how the triumvirate will work, Parzinger says that he, Horst Bredekamp of Humboldt University and MacGregor will run the institution jointly and that all decisions will be taken on a collaborative basis in consultation with the Bundestag, the foreign ministry, and the chancellor’s office. </p> \n<p>Despite MacGregor’s appointment, many still wonder whether the museum and its events programme will truly be a place for free speech – especially given that the German government, in the past, has castigated officials who have publicly addressed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2004/aug/16/germany.andrewmeldrum\">Germany’s colonial-era atrocities</a> or proposed reparation payments to its former colonies. </p> \n<p>“MacGregor has been hailed as this amazing and visionary museum person who will wrest this project out of the doldrums,” noted <a href=\"https://soa.utexas.edu/people/wilfried-wang\">Wilfried Wang</a>, an architect and professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “And yet if one understands how he will be involved – as a member of a triumvirate that is overseen by the government that has a certain political and foreign policy role – you understand that the actual scope of freedom of expression is pretty limited.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6a36bddeadf6f0db265b251aeb8be5e3e0d9000b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431605194782/6ad0bae5-ad3c-4f17-bd6f-6b7196064058-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Berlin palace before its destruction at the end of the second world war.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Berlin palace before its destruction at the end of the second world war.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Berlin Palace-Humboldt Forum Foundation</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some historians worry that in rushing to build the Humboldtform, Germany is skirting a debate about its national identity – about why it feels the need to rebuild the royal palace by 2019. </p> \n<p>“As long as the Palast der Republik – the East German parliament – was there, you could say that the Germans had accepted that the verdict of history is final,” said <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/apr/30/hi-hitler-by-gavriel-d-rosenfeld-review-trivialised\">Gavriel Rosenfeld</a>, an historian at Fairfield University. “But then they removed the palast under the ostensible reason of asbestos and are rebuilding the palace. A powerful impulse is being expressed there.”</p> \n<p>Rosenfeld says older Germans who lobbied hard for the palace’s rebuilding are suffering from an “inability to mourn the past”. </p> \n<p>“The Germans invested so much emotional energy in Hitler in the years of the Third Reich, deifying and loving him, but they couldn’t mourn him for obvious reasons,” Rosenfeld said. “They sublimated all of their emotional energy into reconstruction. It’s an architectural magnification of the Mitscherlich <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/medicine-obituaries/9352806/Margarete-Mitscherlich.html\">theory of the inability to mourn</a> – of wanting to try to undo history and rebuild the fa&ccedil;ades of something that would make them feel a greater sense of self-esteem of being German.” </p> \n<p>Rosenfeld says Germans’ efforts to re-erect baroque buildings destroyed in the second world war have been widespread, particularly in Wismar, Frankfurt, Munich and Potsdam. The effort being put into rebuilding the Prussian royal palace in Berlin is the simply the most obvious example. </p> \n<p>Still, Germany’s desire to include its colonial victims in the official telling of its history is new. </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.houseofculture.or.tz/profile.htm\">Flower Manase</a>, curator at the National Museum of Tanzania in Dar es Salaam, said the Humboldt Forum’s plans to tell the story of the Maji Maji rebellion, in which 75,000 Tanzanians were killed by German soldiers between 1905 and 1907, is a step in the right direction. </p> \n<p>Her hope is that the Humboldt Forum can help close the gap that has emerged between how Germans have told the story of their colonisation of Tanzania and how the Tanzanians have viewed that past. </p> \n<p>“Germans have had their own way of talking about their past and the Maji Maji,” Manase said. “So it’s good that they want to address it now more comprehensively. We are curious to see what they say.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431605503548/127e6861-5885-4e36-9c92-43035c0b2408-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Franco Stella","altText":"The Berlin Palace – Humboldt Forum","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Franco Stella"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431702500319/d9ba6ea8-ab9f-4190-89e5-c0552e1836bb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Neil MacGregor in Berlin earlier this month.
