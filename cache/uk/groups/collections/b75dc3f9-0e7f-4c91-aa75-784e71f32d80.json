It’s convoluted. And for the people to say the science is decided on, this is just really arrogant, to be honest with you.</p> \n<p> “It’s this intellectual arrogance that now you can’t even have a conversation about it. The climate is changing, and we need to adapt to that reality.” </p> \n<p>The former Florida governor’s views on climate change are dramatically at odds with national science academies, and the world’s most authoritative experts on the science, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).<br /></p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.climatechange2013.org/\">IPCC said in a 2013 landmark report</a> that it was extremely likely, or 95% certain, that more than half of the warming observed between 1951 and 2010 was manmade. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2013/may/16/climate-research-nearly-unanimous-humans-causes\">A study</a> found that of 4,000-plus papers published in academic journals that took a position on the causes of climate change, 97% said it was a a result of human activity.</p> \n<p>Bush also challenged Obama’s determination earlier in the day that climate change was a threat to US national security.<br /></p> \n<p> “As a small part of US foreign policy,” Bush said, the US should encourage states that have had an increase in carbon emissions to take on the challenge.</p> \n<p> But the overall country has had a reduction in carbon emissions due to new technologies, conservation measures, higher gas mileage in vehicles and a shift toward natural gas, he said.</p> \n<p> “If the president thinks this is the gravest threat to our national security, it seems like he would say, ‘Let’s expand LNG [liquefied natural gas] as fast as we can to get it into the hands of higher carbon-intense economies like China and other places. Let’s figure out ways to use compressed natural gas for replacing importing diesel fuel, which has a higher carbon footprint,’ ” Bush said.</p> \n<p> Although he does not believe climate change is the “highest priority”, the US should not ignore it, he said. </p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b9ed675bea6d21095a9d481b7f9004a35368b8d2/0_104_3456_2075/3456.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2075,"width":3456,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jim Cole/AP","altText":"Former Florida Gov.

At least three people were holding handguns.</p> \n<p>Before the shooting, the inside of the restaurant appears to be mostly empty. Bikers and other patrons can be seen walking to the windows facing the parking lot, where most of the shooting happened, when the confrontation was apparently under way.</p> \n<p>When gunshots start at 12.24pm on the video most bikers, other patrons and staff immediately run away from the windows and into the restaurant’s interior.

Anchukaitis said the review continues, but that “given the large number of documents to review, and the increasing public demand to review those documents”, the White House asked for them to be released as they were ready.</p> \n<p>The documents’ release follows a high-profile and intensely debated <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n10/seymour-m-hersh/the-killing-of-osama-bin-laden\">article by the veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh</a>, which accused the Obama administration of misleading the public over events before, during and after the May 2011 raid that killed Bin Laden.<br /></p> \n<p>Anchukaitis denied that the release of documents was related to the Obama administration’s pushback against Hersh’s report. </p> \n<p>The declassified documents reveal Bin Laden’s abiding concern with operational security.

In other documents he advises members of al-Qaida to destroy cellphone Sim cards, to keep prescriptions with them to avoid frequent visits to doctors, and to learn Urdu because “it is also of extreme importance, security-wise”.</p> \n<p>In one missive, he worries over the possibility that a wiretap could be concealed in his wife’s clothing.</p> \n<p>“Before Um Hamza arrives here, it is necessary for her to leave everything behind, including clothes, books, everything that she had in Iran,” Bin Laden wrote in a September 2010 letter. “Everything that a needle might possibly penetrate.</p> \n<p>“Some chips have been lately developed for eavesdropping, so small they could easily be hidden inside a syringe,” he said, adding that “Iranians are not to be trusted” and a listening device could be planted in his wife’s belongings.</p> \n<p>Bin Laden also fixates on his al-Qaida heirs, including how to get his son Hamza into Pakistan, and about what precautions the group can take against drone strikes.</p> \n<p>In other letters, he pleaded with his lieutenants to turn away from internecine and regional attacks and to concentrate on major plots against the US.</p> \n<p>“The focus should be on killing and fighting the American people and their representatives,” Bin Laden wrote in one of the documents. “We should stop operations against the army and the police in all regions, especially Yemen.”</p> \n<p>In one <a href=\"http://www.odni.gov/files/documents/ubl/english/Report%20on%20External%20Operations.pdf\">undated report</a>, he wrote of “a number of brothers” sent to attack Britain, Russia and Denmark, including a plan to blow up a gas line or an American embassy. He issued orders on a granular level of transportation and explosives manufacturing, and blamed “bad luck” for the failed plots, saying “God wasn’t on our side.”</p> \n<p>When uprisings erupted in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and around the Middle East, he urged al-Qaida leaders to seize the moment of “revolution” to recruit young people around the region to his cause.</p> \n<p>Bin Laden also exhorted al-Qaida to move away from small, local attacks in the region, but found himself marginalized within the organization, as lone wolf, “individual jihad” attacks gained increasing prominence for other al-Qaida leaders.</p> \n<p>In another document, he cites the unpopularity of the Vietnam war in the US and says that the only way to change American policy is to “start striking America to force it to abandon these rulers and leave the Muslims alone”.</p> \n<p>The titles included in Bin Laden’s personal library reveal an eclectic reader with a predictable taste for classics of jihadi literature, a deep interest in both US foreign policy and a keen desire to see how his own organisation was being portrayed in the international media.<br /></p> \n<p>There are two works by Bin Laden’s mentor, Abdallah Azzam: Join the Caravan and The Defence of Muslim Lands, both of which remain hugely influential among radical Islamists. Azzam led Arab “mujahideen” during the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan and laid down fundamental principles of violent Islamic extremism.</p> \n<p>Bin Laden also had a copy of The America I Have Seen, a vitriolic memoir of a short trip to the US by the Egyptian thinker and activist Syed Qutb, considered the godfather of modern jihadi thinking.</p> \n<p>The collection also included several works on international relations and current affairs, including Obama’s Wars by Bob Woodward, Hegemony or Survival: America’s Quest for Global Dominance by Noam Chomsky, and the Best Democracy Money Can Buy by Greg Palast.<br /></p> \n<p>Bizarrely, the library includes several works by conspiracy theorists, including New Pearl Harbor, which argues that the government of George W Bush was complicit in the 9/11 terror attacks, and Bloodlines of the Illuminati, which claims to reveal the secret network of power-brokers who rule the world.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/20/osama-bin-laden-family-letters\">Osama bin Laden documents reveal intimate correspondence with family</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bin Laden’s letters reveal the al-Qaida chief as a dedicated family man who worries about his four wives, 20 children and other relatives and offered detailed advice and instructions on how to behave.</p> \n<p>“By God, I miss you so much,” he writes in an undated letter to his daughter, Umm Muadh.

Banned from working in Jordan, Sahlee wanted to seek a better life in Europe, so in late April he and his nine-year-old son flew via Dubai to Sudan. Their plan was to then travel to Libya, and then from the Libyan coast to Italy. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/15/trapped-in-dubai-airport-the-father-and-son-who-had-nowhere-to-go\">Trapped in Dubai airport: the father and son who had nowhere to go</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But in Sudan, visa problems instead saw the Sahlees deported back to Dubai airport, where they lived for two weeks because Sahlee no longer had a valid Jordanian visa. It was a situation that eventually attracted the attention of the world’s press, and after a media storm, they were eventually readmitted back to Jordan on a temporary basis. But the activist’s brief grace period now appears to be up, after his brother disclosed that Sahlee has now been taken to the border with Syria, and awaits deportation.</p> \n<p>Thaer al-Sahlee, himself a refugee who reached Europe last year by boat from Libya, said his brother now faces execution. “For sure if the regime catch him he will be dead,” said Thaer. “Wael was wanted by the regime, and he escaped. If he returns back to Syria, he will be killed. It’s no secret.”</p> \n<p>If deported, campaigners say Jordan’s decision would be particularly callous as Sahlee has been offered a visa by the German government, who have asked for more time to complete the administrative procedures necessary to transfer him to Germany. On Wednesday night, the German foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for confirmation.</p> \n<p>Sahlee’s case exemplifies the bureaucratic quagmire faced by the descendants of Palestinian refugees forced from their homes at the time of the creation of the state of Israel. Sahlee’s family settled in Yarmouk, Syria, but they were forced to migrate once again after the outbreak of the Syrian civil war.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2014/jan/14/syrian-palestinian-refugee-egypt-mahmoud\">A Syrian-Palestinian refugee in Egypt: 'If I go back to Syria I will die'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Syrians escaping the war, the onwards options are scarce enough.
