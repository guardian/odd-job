It said the president, Sisi, had invoked national security to trample on liberties.</p> \n<p>“CPJ spoke to high-level officials, including the prosecutor general and the minister of transitional justice, who denied that Egypt was holding any journalists in jail in relation to their work,” the group said in the report, which was based on a census, taken on 1 June, of Egyptian prisons. “But CPJ research shows that the government of al-Sisi … has used the pretext of national security to crack down on human rights, including press freedom.”</p> \n<p>As army chief, Sisi overthrew Morsi in 2013 during protests against his rule, before winning a landslide election last year. Since the overthrow, authorities have cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood and other opponents, killing hundreds, jailing thousands and sparking a backlash of attacks against security forces, mostly in the restive Sinai peninsula. Activists say dozens more journalists have been detained.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5cbd88ad55b8482f3dcad8dceed7339c8d9c3137\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435219189980/804c3e0a-2cb3-469f-bf00-d1c206881370-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ahmed Mansour, an al-Jazeera journalist, speaks to the press on Monday after leaving jail in Berlin, where he was detained on an Egyptian warrant.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ahmed Mansour, an al-Jazeera journalist, speaks to the press on Monday after leaving jail in Berlin, where he was detained on an Egyptian warrant.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Sohn/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cases detailed in the report show that most were jailed for covering protests, airing views contrary to the government or reporting on injustices committed against people affiliated with the Brotherhood, which Egypt considers a terrorist organisation. Several stand accused of “spreading chaos”, while others are charged with disseminating “false news” or anti-government messages.</p> \n<p>In one case highlighted in the report, Mahmoud Abou-Zeid was arrested in August 2013 while taking photographs of the violent dispersal of a pro-Morsi sitin, in which hundreds of Islamists were killed. He has been in pre-trial detention since then and has not been formally charged.</p> \n<p>“I spoke with him last week and he was tired and depressed,” said his brother, Mohamed. “We don’t know what will happen next and have no information regarding the future of the case. It is a very difficult situation for all of us.”</p> \n<p>In another case, a photographer, Omar Abdel-Maksoud, was arrested in 2014 while covering a baby shower for a woman who had been detained and forced to give birth in a hospital in handcuffs. Police launched a violent raid on the gathering, the report said, citing local media.</p> \n<p>CPJ cited cases of journalists disappearing into Egypt’s labyrinth of detention facilities without lawyers or family members knowing where they were, with court hearings sometimes taking place without their knowledge.</p> \n<p>It said the heavy restrictions meant that scarce information emerged from entire regions, especially Sinai, where militant groups are fighting security forces and little was known about the conflict’s toll on civilians. One journalist from the area, Saeed Abuhaj, was arrested for carrying a leaflet bearing Brotherhood slogans, his lawyer said. He has been charged with inciting violence and using weapons against police.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/feb/02/peter-greste-egypt-media-al-jazeera\">Peter Greste is free but Egypt’s journalists remain muzzled | Wadah Khanfar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Several high-profile cases involving the state’s campaign against journalists have attracted international attention, most recently that of Ahmed Mansour, a journalist for the Qatar-based broadcaster al-Jazeera, who was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/21/ahmed-mansour-germany-detains-al-jazeera-journalist-on-egyptian-warrant\">stopped in Germany when officers there acted on an Egyptian arrest warrant</a>.

organisers. </p> \n<p>Participants in the project – state bodies, companies, associations and private individuals – are invited to post their contribution on a website (<a href=\"http://www.pollinatorpassasjen.no/\">polli.no</a>), which maps out the bees’ route across the city. </p> \n<p>On the 12th floor of an ultra-modern office block in the capital’s chic business district on the edge of Oslo fjord, a major accountancy firm has covered parts of its terrace in brightly-flowering Sedum plants and two bee hives.<br /></p> \n<p>It houses some 45,000 worker bees, busily unaware of their smart-suited office counterparts enjoying their lunch just metres away. </p> \n<p>“One should see it as a sign that companies are also taking responsibility for preserving biodiversity,” said accountant and bee-keeping enthusiast Marie Skjelbred.</p> \n<p>She convinced her employer to co-finance the project to the tune of 400,000 kroner ($51,348, or €46,000) along with the owners of the building. </p> \n<p>“The workers live about 60 days,” she explained with a glint in her eye. </p> \n<p>“During their lives, they don’t produce more than a spoon of honey,” she added, before turning to her accountancy skills to do the maths. </p> \n<p>“If we did their job, paid at the minimum wage, a pot of honey would cost $182,000.” </p> \n<p>Although Norwegian bees may not be as seriously threatened by intensive agriculture and pesticides as bees in the US or other European countries, a third of the country’s 200 wild bee species are nonetheless considered endangered. </p>

Expressing concern over President Vladimir Putin’s announcement last week that Russia was to buy 40 new intercontinental ballistic missiles, Nato officials also said there was alarm over Russian rhetoric on nuclear weapons and the extent to which such weapons are involved in military exercises.</p> \n<p>A Nato diplomat said: “There is very real concern about the way in which Russia publicly bandies around nuclear stuff. So there are quite a lot of deliberations in the alliance about nuclear [weapons], but it is being done very slowly and deliberately. We need to do due diligence on where we are.” </p> \n<p>The issue is being discussed on the margins of a two-day Nato ministerial meeting that began in Brussels on Wednesday. But the US is keen to get the issue on the table and a meeting of Nato’s ministerial nuclear planning group is likely to be held later this year – earlier than planned – to discuss refreshing the nuclear doctrine.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/17/nato-russia-elaborate-training-exercise-dangerous-signal\">Nato shows its teeth to Russia with elaborate Baltic training exercise</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Among potential topics is an enhanced role for nuclear weapons in Nato military exercises. Also up for discussion would be how to better interpret Russian warnings about nuclear weapons: whether they should be taken seriously or whether these amount to no more than rhetoric.</p> \n<p>Speaking on the sidelines of the summit, British defence secretary Michael Fallon said Russia’s “nuclear messaging is not helpful”. He added: “It is important we understand its implications for the alliance”.</p> \n<p>Since the peak of the cold war, the US and Russia have slashed their nuclear arsenals but Russia still has an estimated 1,582 strategic warheads deployed on 515 missiles and bombers, while the US has 1,597 deployed on 785. There is no suggestion at Nato headquarters of a return to the days of nuclear arms races and the doctrine of mutually assured destruction, and the US has specifically ruled out returning cruise missiles to Europe.</p> \n<p>But Nato officials, military and diplomats are raising worries that the US-led alliance’s existing nuclear posture reflects the thinking of a decade ago when Russia was viewed as a potential partner. That strategy badly needed to be refreshed, they suggested. Although Nato nuclear exercises are classified, the organisation does, like Russia, conduct them. The concern at Nato is that the role of nuclear weapons in such exercises needs to be upgraded to take account of the changed relationship with Moscow.</p> \n<p>Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, speaking at a press conference on Wednesday, said the nuclear issue was serious and had to be treated with caution. “The nuclear activities, the investments of Russia in new nuclear capabilities, and the exercise activities by Russia in the nuclear domain is part of the global picture where we see a more assertive Russia.”</p> \n<p>The American ambassador to Nato, Douglas Lute, briefing journalists in Brussels on Tuesday, said: “There is a general assessment under way in Washington and a parallel assessment here in Nato to look at all the possible implications of what Russia says about nuclear weapons, its doctrine and so forth, its pronouncements, its rhetoric, and what we actually see on the ground in terms of development and deployment.” Nato, he added, had not yet reached any conclusions or decided on “what are the actions that are implied in our response”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/16/vladimir-putin-opens-russian-military-disneyland-patriot-park\">Vladimir Putin opens Russian 'military Disneyland' Patriot Park</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Putin last week announced plans to purchase 40 intercontinental ballistic missiles and complained of US acts in eastern Europe as amounting to the most aggressive since the cold war.

We cannot go into detail on our nuclear discussions. These are internal, sensitive and classified matters. What I can say is that Nato continuously assess all aspects of Russia’s military activities, including Russia’s nuclear rhetoric.”</p> \n<p>A second Nato official said: “The Russian leadership is rhetorically lowering the threshold when it comes to nuclear weapons and this is something which should not be done. It largely wasn’t done even during the cold war.</p> \n<p>“This kind of nuclear threat was something which we found quite surprising, quite negative and is something we believe should be avoided but we are closely examining it carefully as part of the overall examination of Russia’s activities in Europe and how we at least in Nato must unfortunately react.”</p> \n<p>Fallon announced on Wednesday evening that the UK is to double its spending on training Ukrainian troops from &pound;3m to &pound;6m.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4cf4ffa7eb561b15b1a9ac6f202be2114a8dcf16/0_429_5180_3109/5180.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3109,"width":5180,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Thierry Monasse/AP","altText":"Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a media conference at the EU headquarters in Brussels.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Thierry Monasse/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T21:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T23:01:13Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":955,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewen MacAskill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewenmacaskill"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Nato","Cold war","US foreign policy","Russia","Europe","US news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/nato","webTitle":"Nato"},{"id":"world/cold-war","webTitle":"Cold war"},{"id":"us-news/us-foreign-policy","webTitle":"US foreign policy"},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ewen MacAskill","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ewenmacaskill"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/24/nato-to-review-nuclear-weapon-policy-as-attitude-to-russia-hardens","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4q5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/24/nato-to-review-nuclear-weapon-policy-as-attitude-to-russia-hardens","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/24/nato-to-review-nuclear-weapon-policy-as-attitude-to-russia-hardens"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4cf4ffa7eb561b15b1a9ac6f202be2114a8dcf16/0_429_5180_3109/5180.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3109,"width":5180,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg speaks during a media conference at the EU headquarters in Brussels.
