And act of racist terrorism, perpetrated in a house of God?”</p> \n<p>Commentators have been divided over whether the atrocity, allegedly perpetrated by a 21-year-old South Carolina man, Dylann Roof, constituted an act of terrorism. The Justice Department said it was investigating the mass shooting as a possible case of domestic terrorism, while the the FBI’s director, James Comey, said he does not believe the atrocity fits that definition because it was not, in his view, “a political act”.</p> \n<p>However on Tuesday, Clinton adopted the language used by many other liberals since the comedian Jon Stewart compared Roof’s alleged massacre to terrorism committed by Islamic jihadists <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/video/2015/jun/19/jon-stewart-daily-show-charleston-shooting\">in a widely shared monologue</a>.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/23/hillary-clinton-presidential-election-poll\">Hillary Clinton on course to win presidential election, poll says</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Clinton’s main rival for the Democratic nomination for president, Bernie Sanders, was quicker off the mark, labelling shooting an act of terror within 24 hours of the attack.</p> \n<p>The former secretary of state and first lady also suggested the shooting at the Emanuel AME church was connected to broader racial challenges in the country.</p> \n<p>“I know it’s tempting to dismiss a tragedy such as this as an isolated incident, to believe that in today’s America bigotry largely behind us, that institutionalised racism no longer exists,” she said. “But despite our best efforts and highest hopes, America’s long struggle with race is far from finished.” </p> \n<p>Clinton made the remarks during a visit to a suburb of St Louis, Missouri, not far from Ferguson, where rioting broke out last year following the police shooting of an unarmed 18-year-old, Michael Brown.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/22/hillary-clinton-ferguson-visit\">Hillary Clinton to make campaign stop in Ferguson area on Tuesday</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Despite the shooting and its aftermath being brought up several times during a question and answer session, Clinton did not address the topic head-on. She did not mention Brown, or the civil disorder that spread through the St Louis area after his death in August – and again, in November, when no charges were brought against Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown. </p> \n<p>The only apparent reference to police shootings was a veiled reference. “We must do all we can to be sure our communities respect law enforcement, and that law enforcement respects the communities they serve,” she said.</p> \n<p>Clinton’s willingness to address the broader issues of racial disparities head-on has been contrasted with her failed presidential bid in 2008, which she lost to Barack Obama. During that race Clinton, who was politicised during the 1960s civil rights movement, fumbled over race issues, a controversy that was compounded when her husband, ex-president Bill Clinton, <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0108/7845.html\">criticised Obama in terms that some believed were racially tinged</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>This time around, Clinton’s campaign believes she has found her stride on the issue of race, speaking forcefully about the need for reform of the criminal justice system, for example, shortly after rioting broke out in Baltimore. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/30/hillary-clinton-southern-black-voters-south-carolina\">'People are going to be just as excited': Clinton courts Obama's black southern stronghold</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Surveys also show Clinton enjoying broad and deep support among black and minority communities, in contrast to Sanders, who trails far behind in polls of Democratic primary voters and gains most of his support from white, low-income and middle-class supporters.</p> \n<p>Despite being widely trailed in advance, Clinton’s speech at Florissant’s Christ the King United Church was brief – lasting around 20 minutes – and did not explore racial disparities in a huge amount of depth.</p> \n<p>The event was, instead, more in keeping with the intimate listening tour that marked the start of her campaign. </p> \n<p>“We need to confront the deep-seated biases and prejudices that still live within too many of us,” Clinton said in one exchange with local leaders gathered on stage with her at the church. “It is something that is hard to talk about. And honestly I think the vast majority of us could pass lie detector tests if we were asked. We’d say ‘of course not, I don’t have any prejudice of bias’, but we do. And we know we do if we’re really honest with each other.”</p> \n<p>The speech also touched upon Clinton’s own Christian beliefs and Methodist background, quoting Martin Luther King Jr, the archbishop Desmond Tutu, and John Wesley, a co-founder of the Methodist church. Clinton praised the families of victims of the Charleston shooting for publicly offering forgiveness to Roof.</p> \n<p>Relatives of the shooting took turns to tell the alleged killer <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/19/i-forgive-you-charleston-church-victims-families-confront-suspect\">they forgave him during a court appearance on Friday</a>. “Isn’t it amazing, remarkable even, when fear, doubt, desire for revenge, might have been expected, but instead forgiveness is found?” she said.</p> \n<p>“Although a fundamental part of our doctrine, its practice is one of the most difficult things we are called to do.” Clinton added: “Their act of mercy was as stunning as his act of cruelty.”</p> \n<p>Clinton also <a

urgent action is needed to treat people with symptoms of deadly disease who have avoided visiting health clinics during epidemic<br /></p>","byline":"Sarah Boseley Health editor","body":"<p>Tens of thousands of malaria cases went untreated in Guinea last year as people with symptoms shunned health clinics for fear of being sent into isolation at Ebola treatment centres, according to authoritative research.</p> \n<p>A major paper from infectious diseases experts said 74,000 fewer people were diagnosed and offered malaria treatment than would have been expected. The research was based on a survey of public health facilities in December 2014 and interviews with healthcare workers.</p> \n<p>The paper says far more people will have died from malaria in 2014 than Ebola, which had killed 2,444 people by 15 June of this year. </p> \n<p>Urgent action was required to get malaria treatment to those who needed it, say the paper’s authors from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, and the President’s Malaria Initiative in the <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099(15)00061-4/abstract\">Lancet’s Infectious Diseases</a> journal.</p> \n<p>“The two major avenues for delivering life-saving medicine to patients with malaria – public health facilities and community health workers – have been substantially compromised by the Ebola virus-disease epidemic,” they write. “Efforts to reinforce malaria care delivery in Guinea should be focused on reconnecting healthcare workers and health facilities with the communities they serve and whose trust they need to regain.”</p> \n<p>In the areas of Guinea hit worst by Ebola, the numbers of people seeking treatment at outpatient clinics dropped by up to 42% and the numbers seeking care for suspected malaria were down by 69%, according to the first systematic survey from one of the three countries affected by the epidemic.</p> \n<p>Fewer oral malaria drugs were given (down 24%) and fewer injectables (down 30%) than the previous year. In districts affected by Ebola the numbers of community health workers actively working also dropped from 98% before Ebola to 74%, while those treating malaria dropped to less than half (48%).</p> \n<p>“One problem is that the early symptoms of malaria (fever, headache, and body aches) mimic those of Ebola virus disease,” said the lead author, Dr Mateusz Plucinski. “Malaria is one of the main causes of fever and health facilities visits in Guinea, but our data suggest that since the start of the Ebola epidemic people with fevers have avoided clinics for fear of contracting Ebola or being sent to an Ebola treatment centre.”</p> \n<p>But, he added, untreated malaria cases will have led to more malaria in the villages and increased the numbers eventually arriving at clinics with fever who could be suffering from either malaria or Ebola. “This puts extra pressure on an already overburdened health system owing to a greater number of suspected Ebola cases requiring triage and isolation at treatment centres. Malaria control efforts and care delivery must be kept on track during an Ebola epidemic so that progress made in malaria control is not jeopardised and Ebola outbreak response is not impeded,” he said.</p> \n<p>New guidelines from the World Health Organisation recommend giving malaria drugs to everyone with a fever during an Ebola outbreak and handing out drugs that families can take to stave off a bout of the disease. Dr Franco Pagnoni, of the WHO, says in a comment piece in the journal that while this will help, it is important to return to business as usual. </p> \n<p>“To restore the credibility of health service delivery in the population, it is important that Ebola-virus-disease-specific activities in the communities, such as contract tracing and safe burials, are accompanied by the delivery of standard health services, such as distribution of long-lasting impregnated nets, vaccination, or community case management of child diseases with specific no-touch approaches appropriate to the context of the epidemic,” he writes.</p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435075363401/9778b1ed-1bf9-4777-941c-28bbf9f5689e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tim Flach/Getty Images","altText":"A microscopic image of the malaria-carrying Anopheles mosquito.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tim Flach/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T23:01:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T06:33:54Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Sarah Boseley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sarahboseley"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Malaria","Ebola","Guinea","World news","Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"society/malaria","webTitle":"Malaria"},{"id":"world/ebola","webTitle":"Ebola"},{"id":"world/guinea","webTitle":"Guinea"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"}],"section":{"id":"society"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sarah Boseley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sarahboseley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"society"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/jun/24/thousands-of-guinea-malaria-cases-go-untreated-amid-ebola-fears","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3eg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/society/2015/jun/24/thousands-of-guinea-malaria-cases-go-untreated-amid-ebola-fears","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/24/thousands-of-guinea-malaria-cases-go-untreated-amid-ebola-fears"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435075363401/9778b1ed-1bf9-4777-941c-28bbf9f5689e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A microscopic image of the malaria-carrying Anopheles mosquito.

It’s been bad for years now. I don’t know if it’s getting worse, or not. It’s definitely not getting better,” he says.</p> \n<p>There are now fears that millions of children in India will suffer serious health problems later in life.</p> \n<p>“If you look at lung function in children [here], there is significant decline with constant exposure. This will probably be irreversible. For adults, there is also a more rapid decline than usual with age. Some suggest it is the equivalent of smoking around 10 cigarettes per day. There is also a higher chance of developing coronary and arterial disease,” says Dr Guleria, a lung specialist at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.</p> \n<p>The WHO found that India has the world’s highest rate of death from respiratory disease, with 159 per 100,000 in 2012, about 10 times that of Italy, five times that of the UK and twice that of China. One <a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/landmark-study-lies-buried-how-delhis-poisonous-air-is-damaging-its-children-for-life/\">study</a> found that half of Delhi’s 4.4 million schoolchildren would never recover full lung capacity.</p> \n<p>Much depends on levels of exposure, which means that children, who in India often cycle or walk to school along busy roads, receive extremely high doses of toxic chemicals and damaging particulates. <a href=\"http://www.greenpeace.org/india/en/Press/-Delhi-children-breath-toxic-air-reveals-Greenpeace-air-monitoring-survey-in-schools/\">Daily levels in schools</a> are four times worse than those that are supposed to trigger alerts in London.</p> \n<p>In Anand Vihar, the factors that cause pollution across Delhi are particularly severe. There is heavy traffic, swollen by often badly maintained and old trucks and buses; huge landfill rubbish dumps which are sometimes set on fire; filthy industries just a few miles from the city; two coal-fired power stations; nearby intensive construction which generates choking clouds of dust; and, seasonally, smoke from crop burning in fields from farmland in neighbouring states.</p> \n<p>Another blackspot in Delhi is Munirka, in the south of the city and close to two heavily congested ring roads.<br /></p> \n<p>Meenu Singh, a Munirka resident whose eight-year-old son has severe asthma which doctors blame on pollution, says she would leave the city if she could.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4561540828a61f9427793fa4b194c9f5caf64a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434454114521/e760fcf8-6da1-4572-b590-cf514236ac8b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Smog envelops buildings on the outskirts of Delhi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Smog envelops buildings on the outskirts o Delhi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roberto Schmidt/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I’m really worried about my child’s health.

Classes at international schools in the city have been cut as numbers dwindle.</p> \n<p>Delhi saw significant improvement in its air quality a decade ago following a slew of measures including converting buses and autorickshaws to run on gas, moving small industries to zones on the outskirts of the city and raising emission standards. But benefits were swiftly lost.</p> \n<p>“We could not keep the momentum. Now there is a new challenge, and it is much more complicated,” says Anumita Choudhury of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi thinktank.</p> \n<p>Choudhury says the problem is a “mobility crisis” in Delhi as use of private vehicles has soared while public transport has suffered chronic under-investment. Between 1991 and 2011, the population of Delhi and its adjoining cities more than doubled to 22 million while the number of registered cars and motorbikes increased fivefold to around 8m.</p> \n<p>“We love our cars these days and middle class families have two, three, four of them,” says Surender Sharma, a retired senior air force officer in Delhi who moved to the top floor of a high rise block on the city’s outskirts three years ago to escape air pollution.</p> \n<p>Environmentalists<a href=\"http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/home/environment/pollution/Act-on-Delhis-foul-air-now/articleshow/47561541.cms\"> say</a> between 40% and 50% of the dangerous PM2.5 particulates in Delhi are caused by vehicles. The figures have been challenged by the car industry. One major problem, all admit, is the 70,000 trucks which drive through the city every night on long-distance journeys. A plan to build a bypass has been repeatedly delayed.</p> \n<p>A new metro has barely made an impact, experts say, as almost all those who use it were previously using buses or bicycles, not cars.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce77ccafa31c8c2ed14a67e948035b4496100f64\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434453325103/93eb9aa8-c674-41d0-98a0-b3ccc5b85d2f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Police officers wear masks as they control traffic in Delhi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers wear masks as they control traffic in Delhi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After being ignored by the media and politicians for many years, the problem of toxic air is now becoming a significant domestic issue with newspapers highlighting the problem.</p> \n<p>“Clean air is a human right,” Prakash Javadekar, the environment minister, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/apr/05/indian-minister-promises-acute-air-pollution-world-health-organisation\">said earlier this year</a>.</p> \n<p>The Bharatiya Janata party government won a landslide victory at an election last year. The prime minister, Narendra Modi, campaigned on a promise of boosting India’s flagging growth. It has been unclear how he intends to reconcile economic development with protection of India’s forests and rivers and an improvement in air quality.</p> \n<p>Conflicts between local and national governments, and between agencies, have also hampered efforts.</p> \n<p>The result is that no significant policies beyond a national air monitoring index have yet been announced, while many measures introduced elsewhere, such as<a href=\"http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/delhi/sorry-children-school-wont-shut-on-bad-air-days/\"> closing schools</a> during spikes of pollution or forcing old vehicles off the road, have been rejected.</p> \n<p>“Only 14% of individual journeys in Delhi are made in private vehicles. It is a small minority who are determining policy in this city so the majority voice has to come out louder to determine travel and investment choices,” says Choudhury, of the CSE.</p> \n<p>The problem is not restricted to the capital. According to the WHO, 13 of the dirtiest 20 cities in the world are in India.</p> \n<p>Medical experts fear a failure to act rapidly could be costly in the long run. “We have a very young population currently being exposed [to severe pollution] and they will have very significant health problems in 15 to 20 years’ time. We are just looking at this in terms of short-term economic growth. The health cost has been forgotten,” says Guleria, the lung specialist.</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434728512023/2eb20871-6bd1-42c6-a52e-e1c880efd0f1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Hindustan Times/Getty Images","altText":"Children cover their faces to try to protect themselves from air pollution in the Indian capital.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Hindustan Times/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434454116187/e760fcf8-6da1-4572-b590-cf514236ac8b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Smog envelops buildings on the outskirts o Delhi.

The leaders say the issue will be settled by next month although it is not clear whether that will be merely a coalition of the willing or whether there will be mandatory quotas. </p> \n<p>Given the fierce resistance in eastern Europe to the idea of being forced by Brussels to take in refugees, the sharing is likely to be on a voluntary basis.</p> \n<p>Far from opening borders, Europe is closing down.

This is an all-time high that needs a record response. Other regions with many more refugees are closely watching this continent,” he told the Council of Europe, the human rights watchdog that is quite separate from the EU. “Europe needs safer, regular, and orderly channels for migration and mobility.”</p> \n<p>The summit document, however, focuses on keeping migrants out and quickly deporting those who do not qualify for asylum.</p> \n<p>“The commission will set out by July 2015 how Frontex will bring immediate support to frontline states on return. The commission has announced its intention to propose to amend the Frontex regulation to strengthen the role of Frontex in return, notably so that it can initiate return missions.”</p> \n<p>The Avramopoulos letter laying out the policy goes further, complaining that fewer than 40% of failed asylum applicants are expelled from the EU.</p> \n<p>“To make sure that irregular migrants are effectively returned, detention should be applied, as a legitimate measure of last resort, where it is necessary to avoid that irregular migrants might abscond.”</p> \n<p>They may be detained for six months, but also up to 18 months “in cases of non-cooperation”, while in emergency situations of large influxes as currently in Italy, the rules governing detention may be waived, meaning there is no need for “separate accommodation guaranteeing family privacy”, that venues other than prisons and detention facilities can be used to hold people, and the need for quick judicial review of the cases can be dropped.</p> \n<p>“Where is the EU going?” asked Tony Bunyan, director of Statewatch, a watchdog monitoring civil liberties in the EU. </p> \n<p>“Migrants, including pregnant women and minors, who have fled from war, persecution and poverty are to be forcibly fingerprinted or held in detention until they acquiesce or are expelled and banned from re-entry.”</p> \n<p>On the eve of Thursday’s summit, M&eacute;decins Sans Fronti&egrave;res blamed the Mediterranean crisis squarely on the EU.</p> \n<p>“This is an orchestrated humanitarian crisis, created by the failure of the EU to put in place adequate and humane policies and practices to deal with this issue,” said Aur&eacute;lie Ponthieu, MSF migration adviser. </p> \n<p>“The deteriorating situation is not due to unmanageable numbers of migrants and refugees. It is a direct result of chronic shortcomings in the EU’s policies in handling the new arrivals. Member states spend their time talking about closing borders, building fences, and issuing threatening ultimatums to each other.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2e6c8cc2f043be7ba341b017f2445a51a327a7d2/0_89_3504_2102/3504.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2102,"width":3504,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mauro Seminara/AP","altText":"Migrants wait to disembark from a ship in Lampedusa, Italy, after they were rescued at sea.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mauro Seminara/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T16:33:51Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T23:01:36Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Traynor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iantraynor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Migration","European Union","Italy","Greece","Libya","World news","Africa","Europe","Middle East and North Africa","European commission"],"tags":[{"id":"world/migration","webTitle":"Migration"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"world/italy","webTitle":"Italy"},{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/libya","webTitle":"Libya"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/africa","webTitle":"Africa"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/european-commission","webTitle":"European commission"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian Traynor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/iantraynor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/23/eu-to-create-new-quarantine-system-for-mediterranean-migrants","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3ty","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/23/eu-to-create-new-quarantine-system-for-mediterranean-migrants","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/23/eu-to-create-new-quarantine-system-for-mediterranean-migrants"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2e6c8cc2f043be7ba341b017f2445a51a327a7d2/0_89_3504_2102/3504.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2102,"width":3504,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Migrants wait to disembark from a ship in Lampedusa, Italy, after they were rescued at sea.

We are still seeing about two or three of these beheadings each week. They are heeding advice from a decade before from Osama bin Laden and they are taking it to another level using social media.”</p> \n<p>Drummond, a lead figure in the internet company’s battles with regulators globally, told the thousands of media executives in attendance that the Isis movement has been strategically astute in using social media for propaganda and recruitment purposes.</p> \n<p>“The power of community is not lost on Isis and they are using it to great effect. Right now the voice of that community is a lot larger than ours, a lot louder, there’s more out there on the web. When I say ours, I mean all of us, all of us in the room today.”</p> \n<p>While an element of Google’s presentation was undeniably an anti-regulation plug about the virtues of Google’s global operations, the Silicon Valley firm made a case for an anti-Isis push.</p> \n<p>“The challenge for us is to strike this balance between allowing people to be educated about the dangers and the violence of this group,” said Grand. “But not allowing ourselves to become a distribution channel for this horrible, but very newsworthy, terrorist propaganda.”</p> \n<p>Google’s talk covered a wide range of topics that the company is forced to make decisions on about censoring, from Robin Thicke’s misogynistic Blurred Lines video and a sexually explicit trailer for Lars von Trier’s film Nymphomaniac, to “prank” videos of teenagers inhaling deodorant spray cans, “how-to” euthanasia videos and police shootings in the USA.</p> \n<p>However, arguably the most striking debate, which included the audience voting with red and green paddles about whether they would ban or approve material, involved Google’s discussion on terrorist propaganda.</p> \n<p>Google explained its justification for allowing graphic videos of the death of Neda Agha-Soltan, caught by an amateur in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/jun/13/iran-elections-neda-agha-soltan\">aftermath of Iran’s elections in 2009</a>, and the decision not to block the film of terrorists killing a policeman in the Charlie Hebdo massacre.</p> \n<p>“At about 4:30am on the day [the Charlie Hebdo attack] happened, we got a call from our French colleagues asking what to do,” said Drummond. “As with other moment-of-death footage, we had to consider the dignity of the victim as well as the video’s news and commentary value. We decided to leave it up, and leave it up globally, [but not France where it is legally banned]. </p> \n<p>“It’s important to recognise here that the filming was done by a bystander who recorded the event. It wasn’t filmed by the perpetrators, wasn’t intended to terrorise anyone. Even though it is shaky footage, it became a critical part of piecing this event together, helping us to understand an event that happened far out of the media spotlight.”</p> \n<p>Google said this kind of footage – Grand described some of the films from repressed regimes as “shining a light in places that can be pitch black” with media blackouts – was justified but that Isis’s use of YouTube was not.</p> \n<p>The company criticised outlets, including Fox News, for deciding to run full footage of the death of a Jordanian fighter pilot, which Google blocked.</p> \n<p>“Like the others, the purpose of this Isis execution of a Jordanian fighter pilot is to showcase in full high definition the most brutal way to die,” said Grand. “But a handful of mainstream broadcast outlets, including many outlets in the Middle East, as well as Fox News, made the decision to show this even though they wouldn’t show the beheading [of James Foley].”</p> \n<p>Grand said it was a “tough call” to ban the news organisations’ reports of the death that used the full graphic footage.</p> \n<p>“Yes, it was technically news but we decided that for some types of content, including Isis staged executions, the frame or news context put around it just can’t transform the original,” said Grand. “It was brutally violent propaganda produced by terrorists and we just don’t want YouTube to be a distribution channel for it.”</p> \n<p>However, despite raising the calculated strategy of the Isis digital onslaught, Google argued that straight blanket censorship was not the answer.</p> \n<p>“Most of us, we want to see less violence in the world,” said Drummond. “We want alternatives. For many, the answer seems to be censorship. Although we take down the worst content from our sites, at Google, given the proliferation of content online we don’t believe that censoring the existence of Isis on Google, YouTube or social media will dampen their impact really. We think there is a better way to combat the hateful rhetoric of Isis, by countering it with reason. Understand it. Standing up to it. Enforced silence is not the answer. Drowning out the harmful ideology with better messages, with reasonable messages, is the better way.”</p> \n<p>Google put forward a challenge to the advertising and marketing executives to help populate YouTube with more content that combats Isis propaganda.</p> \n<p>“We used to think of terrorists as people who are hiding out in caves But now would-be terrorists are hanging out online. Technology is one of the greatest tools we have to reach at-risk youth all over the world and divert them from hate and radicalisation. We can only do that if we offer them alternatives. Only on open and diverse sites like YouTube… that we can find these countervailing points of view”.</p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434391942518/Armed-Isis-flag-waver-Mos-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"  Stringer Iraq/Reuters","altText":"Armed Isis flag-waver, Mosul","cleanCredit":"Photograph:   Stringer Iraq/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T06:36:51Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T07:57:45Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Mark Sweney","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/marksweney"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes Lions 2015","Google","Media","Islamic State","World news","Digital media","YouTube","Technology","Social media"],"tags":[{"id":"media/cannes-lions-2015","webTitle":"Cannes Lions 2015"},{"id":"technology/google","webTitle":"Google"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"world/isis","webTitle":"Islamic State"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"media/digital-media","webTitle":"Digital media"},{"id":"technology/youtube","webTitle":"YouTube"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Mark Sweney","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/marksweney"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/24/google-youtube-anti-isis-push-inhuman-beheading-videos-censorship","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a45n","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/2015/jun/24/google-youtube-anti-isis-push-inhuman-beheading-videos-censorship","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/24/google-youtube-anti-isis-push-inhuman-beheading-videos-censorship"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434391942518/Armed-Isis-flag-waver-Mos-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Google executives say ‘hateful rhetoric’ by Isis must be countered with reason and blanket censorship of its existence will not dampen its impact.
