But it was Rand Paul, the recalcitrant senator from Kentucky, who forced the suspension of powers used by the country’s spy agencies this week, in a high-stakes gamble he hopes will boost his campaign to be the Republican nominee for the White House in 2016.</p> \n<p>No politician has done more to disempower the National Security Agency than Paul, whose likes to tell audiences on the campaign trail that what they do on their cell phone is “none of the government’s damn business”.</p> \n<p>By his own admission, Paul’s latest gambit will be short-lived. The senator forced the expiration of surveillance laws introduced after 9/11 by delaying legislation that will almost certainly be passed in a few days. </p> \n<p>Yet the widely expected passage of the the USA Freedom Act later this week will mark a more permanent victory for advocates of surveillance reform: a ban on the NSA hoovering up the telephone records of American citizens.</p> \n<p>Paul and his allies argue the compromise bill does not go far enough. But in adopting a hard line, they can claim credit for forcing the Senate and White House to reluctantly agree to a set of a reforms they have long resisted.</p> \n<p>Much of that can be put down to Paul’s combination of single-mindedness and tactical acumen, traits which make the senator a serious contender in the emerging – and wide-open – race for the Republican nomination. </p> \n<p>Perhaps unfairly, Paul is often referred to as a “second-tier” Republican presidential aspirant, after Jeb Bush, the son of George Bush and brother of George HW Bush, Florida senator Marco Rubio, and Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin.</p> \n<p>Yet in the early caucus states of Iowa and New Hampshire, Paul is often cited as the dark horse to watch. </p> \n<p>The Kentucky senator has adopted a more diluted brand of the libertarian politics of his father, Ron Paul, the anti-war Texan congressman who twice sought the nomination of the Republican party.</p> \n<p>Rand Paul has toned down to broaden his reach, believing that his libertarian grounding can be repackaged to appeal to a wider electorate. </p> \n<p>He has aggressively courted African Americans concerned about the racially biased criminal justice system and schmoozed with Silicon Valley donors rarely courted by Republicans.</p> \n<p>It is unorthodox, but by design. One senior aide who works for the senator said that on their first day on the job, staffers were given a singular mandate: make friends with Democrats, and persuade senators across the aisle to partner on joint legislation that would appeal to liberals. </p> \n<p>Paul’s two-year campaign to curtail US surveillance powers – in a partnership with leftwing Democrats – has been a case in point, although his efforts over the last 24 hours have been more as a one-man show. </p> \n<p>The peculiar rules of the US Senate have long allowed individual senators to single-handedly block or frustrate legislation, for example with long, filibustering speeches that run out the clock on the allotted time for a bill.</p> \n<p>Paul has used all the levers available to a senator to stand in the way of a bill in recent days, in full knowledge that the chamber’s failure to pass legislation would disempower the country’s spy agencies. </p> \n<p>In doing so he has infuriated the White House, NSA and many of his Republican colleagues. Among the more irate has been the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who happens to be Kentucky’s other senator. McConnell has endorsed Paul for president, but he could barely conceal his contempt for his fellow senator in a speech on the Senate floor late on Sunday. </p> \n<p>Looking toward Paul, McConnell complained that “a campaign of demagoguery and disinformation launched in the wake of the unlawful actions of Edward Snowden” had in effect led the country into “disarming unilaterally”. </p> \n<p>It says a lot about the first-term senator that he managed to dismantle parts of the Patriot Act – one of George W Bush’s signature pieces of anti-terrorist legislation – enraging much of his party, and emerge claiming “victory no matter how you look at it”.</p> \n<p>On paper, Paul is a rather improbable presidential candidate. The 52-year-old former opthalmologist is 5 ft 7 inches tall and dishevelled-looking. He is not especially charismatic, struggles to stir audiences with his speeches on the campaign trail and can look awkward interacting with supporters.</p> \n<p>He has also acquired a reputation for brusqueness with journalists (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/apr/10/rand-paul-walks-out-live-interview\">he walked out of an interview with the Guardian in Iowa</a>) and, unusually for an American politician, he hardly ever smiles. </p> \n<p>Yet Paul boasts some rare political attributes. He has inherited from his father a large network of libertarian-leaning activists, particularly in New Hampshire, where Ron Paul came in second in 2012 after Mitt Romney. </p> \n<p>He also enjoys taking risks and revels in the idea of swimming against the tide. </p> \n<p>“People here in town think I’m making a huge mistake,” he said in defiant remarks on the Senate floor on Sunday, as he in effect rendered some NSA and FBI tactics inoperable. “Some of them, I think, secretly want there to be an attack on the United States so they can blame it on me.”</p> \n<p>Paul walked back that statement on Monday, telling a Fox News interviewer “hyperbole can get the better of anyone”, but the remark gave a glimpse into what critics insist is the senator’s achilles heel: a susceptibility to the charge that he is a radical, fringe candidate cut from the same cloth as his father. </p> \n<p>That is a reputation that Paul has tried hard to shake, even going as far as to deliver a mildly hawkish speech in front of USS Yorktown, a decommissioned aircraft carrier in South Carolina. </p> \n<p>Paul’s strategy is to be mainstream enough to come across as an acceptable candidate to Republican primary voters, but unusual enough to offer something genuinely different. </p> \n<p>Still, the conventional wisdom among Republican political operatives in Washington right now is that the tightrope Paul is walking probably won’t lead to the White House. </p> \n<p>Memories of Bush’s calamitous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are beginning to fade. The moment for a libertarian, anti-interventionist candidate has passed. </p> \n<p>Yet even Paul’s detractors refuse to rule him out. <br /></p> \n<p>The Republican field of likely 2016 presidential candidates is already bewilderingly crowded. </p> \n<p>Nine candidates have declared so far – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/01/south-carolina-senator-lindsey-graham-joins-republican-presidential-race\">the latest being hawkish South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham</a> – and more than twice that number are believed to be preparing announcements in the coming weeks. </p> \n<p>One top Republican official told the Guardian the party has for months been locked in secret talks with TV networks about how – or whether – it will fit all the candidates onstage for the primary debates. It will, the official admitted, be “a circus”.</p> \n<p>Both sides have agreed to at least try to enable all declared candidates to line up together on one stage for the first debate in August. Thereafter, both sides will have to find a way to weed out the field, probably by leaving out candidates with the lowest national poll ratings.</p> \n<p>Both the GOP and the TV networks fear legal challenges from candidates that don’t make the cut.</p> \n<p>Against that backdrop, the first challenge for any Republican candidate will be standing apart from the crowd and getting noticed. On that measure at least, Paul is already in pole position.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433182038798/f7c8b744-84ad-4737-9d30-da82678a0e06-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Pete Marovich/EPA","altText":"Senator Rand Paul on Capitol Hill","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Pete Marovich/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-01T18:33:19Z","lastModified":"2015-06-01T23:45:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Lewis","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/paullewis"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Rand Paul","US politics","US elections 2016","Republicans","NSA","Surveillance","US news"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/rand-paul","webTitle":"Rand Paul"},{"id":"us-news/us-politics","webTitle":"US politics"},{"id":"us-news/us-elections-2016","webTitle":"US elections 2016"},{"id":"us-news/republicans","webTitle":"Republicans"},{"id":"us-news/nsa","webTitle":"NSA"},{"id":"world/surveillance","webTitle":"Surveillance"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paul Lewis","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/paullewis"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/01/rand-paul-nsa-presidential-election-2016","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49d47","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jun/01/rand-paul-nsa-presidential-election-2016","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/01/rand-paul-nsa-presidential-election-2016"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433182038798/f7c8b744-84ad-4737-9d30-da82678a0e06-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Senator Rand Paul speaks to the media after speaking on the Senate floor during a rare Sunday session on Capitol Hill.

It was first officially recorded on the two islands in 2006, having been washed over by heavy rainfall. Waltham said they will be very difficult to eradicate from the two islands.</p> \n<p>The climbing perch, or <em>Anabas testudineus</em>, has sharp spines on the extendable cover of its gills, which it uses to drag itself over dry land as it travels from one waterhole to another.</p> \n<p>Waltham said the fish was also able to survive for relatively long periods of time out of water because “next to the gills it has lungs, same as us, so it can breathe air on land”.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90ff1a8ce675083af75c0814fd56ce08af751a30\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/90ff1a8ce675083af75c0814fd56ce08af751a30/0_111_1024_614/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nathan Waltham, right, with Torres Straits regional authority rangers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Waltham, right, with Torres Straits regional authority rangers.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nathan Waltham/James Cook University</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was evidence that the freshwater fish, which have been known to hibernate in the mud of dried-up creek beds for up to six months, could tolerate exposure to saltwater. Waltham said he observed climbing perch living in very salty waterholes, equivalent to ocean water, on a trip to the two islands in December.</p> \n<p>Although it was unlikely the fish would be capable of swimming to the Australian mainland there was a danger it would “arrive in the bottom of a fishing boat or as discarded live-bait fish”.</p> \n<p>The scientists have brought the fish to their laboratory to better understand how much salt the fish can tolerate, how it is doing so and test how fast it can move across different terrain.</p> \n<p>The fish has been known to swell up when swallowed by larger predators, blocking their throats so they choke or starve. Barramundi, catfish and even some aquatic birds that died after ingesting the fish have been discovered by Waltham’s colleagues in the PNG.</p> \n<p>This unique ability worries Australian ecologists. “When they populate an area they’re not commonly found in, they can disrupt the balance of that habitat,” Waltham said. “That’s why we’re working with Torres Strait authorities to make sure they don’t spread further south.”</p> \n<p>A team from James Cook University has been monitoring the perch’s spread with rangers from the Torres Strait regional authority and Torres Strait communities.<br /></p> \n<p>Waltham said locals that find a fish species they are not familiar with should report it to the relevant authorities. “Only with ongoing education and surveillance are we going to prevent climbing perch from arriving in northern Australia,” he said.</p> \n<p>Herbert Warusam, a ranger on Saibai island, said the fish were being actively monitored and local fisherman were being educated to report sightings. “It is important we don’t let them travel beyond our island,” he said.</p> \n<p>Waltham said the climbing perch was just one of several invasive wetland-dwelling species in PNG – including walking catfish, snakehead, pacu, tilapia and gourami – that posed a possible threat to Australian habitats.</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5b89099fdbec9c463725201d9e659bd842811fe6/176_438_3773_2269/3773.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2269,"width":3773,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Nathan Waltham/James Cook University","altText":"An invasive fish species called climbing perch can crawl across dry land, live up to six days out of water and suffocate its predators.

Officials said Burke is expected in the coming days to perform surgery on Kerry’s right femur, which he fractured on Sunday in a bicycle accident when he struck a curb and fell on a regular Tour de France route south-east of the Swiss city.</p> \n<p>He had been receiving treatment at Geneva’s main medical centre, HUG, and was taken to Massachusetts General Hospital after he returned home to Boston. An avid cyclist, he had hip replacement surgery several years ago. The fracture was near the hip, leading to speculation that his recovery would be lengthy and prevent him from being as involved in the Iran negotiations as he has been over the past two years.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d78523cb058f5547736c648e1675aea1d51e2b5\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d78523cb058f5547736c648e1675aea1d51e2b5/0_333_3792_2275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An ambulance backs up to the military plane carrying US secretary of state John Kerry back to Boston\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An ambulance backs up to the military plane carrying US secretary of state John Kerry at Logan International Airport in Boston on Monday</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Dwyer/Associated Press</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The State Department sought to tamp down such suggestions, saying that Kerry is committed “to pursuing an aggressive recovery schedule” and had spent much of Sunday and Monday on the phone with colleagues, including President Barack Obama and counterparts, including the French, Spanish and Iranian foreign ministers. He had spent six hours with Iranian foreign minister Mohamad Javad Zarif on Saturday in Geneva before his bike accident.</p> \n<p>“Secretary Kerry’s main focus for the month of June remains squarely on the Iran negotiations,” spokeswoman Marie Harf told reporters. “His injury does not change that. He and the entire team are absolutely committed to the same timetable and are working toward June 30th as the deadline for these talks.”</p> \n<p>Kerry himself expressed optimism as his plane took off from Geneva, saying on Twitter that that was eager to return to work.</p> \n<p>“Look fwd to getting leg set &amp; getting back to @StateDept!” he tweeted. “Meantime, work goes on. Big thanks for well-wishes. #Onward.” In a French-language tweet, he thanked the local Swiss and French police and emergency workers, calling them “real professionals”.</p> \n<p>The State Department referred questions about Kerry’s treatment and recovery time to his physicians.</p> \n<p>But Harf stressed that Kerry expects to participate in person in the rounds of negotiations with Iran.</p> \n<p>At the White House, spokesman Josh Earnest appeared less certain but maintained that Kerry’s broken leg wouldn’t derail the talks.</p> \n<p>“We do continue to believe that we have the time and resources necessary to pursue and hopefully complete the Iran negotiations,” Earnest said, expressing confidence that Kerry would continue to play a “critically important and leading role” with hopes of completing the deal by the end of the month.</p> \n<p>He said, however, that it was unlikely Kerry would be able to return to his previous pace of travel for the talks.</p> \n<p>The broken leg has already altered his travel plans. He had planned to travel to Madrid on Sunday for meetings with Spain’s king and its prime minister, before spending two days in Paris at an international gathering to combat Islamic State. He will now participate in the Paris conference remotely.</p> \n<p>Kerry had been taken by helicopter to the Geneva hospital following the accident on Sunday after a paramedic and a physician who were traveling in his motorcade at the time of crash provided him with immediate attention. X-rays confirmed the extent of his injury.</p> \n<p>His regular government plane returned on Sunday night to the US carrying much of his staff and reporters who had accompanied him on the trip. He had hoped to leave later in the day on a plane fitted with special medical equipment.</p> \n<p>Kerry’s cycling rides have been a regular occurrence on his trips. He often takes his bike with him on the plane and was riding that bicycle on Sunday.</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2e7cce6d03619920bac49c3f761d4d31cce7b4e4/0_140_3507_2106/3507.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2106,"width":3507,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"John Kerry (on right) rides his bike during a break in negotiations in Lausanne, Switzerland.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Fabrice Coffrini/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4d78523cb058f5547736c648e1675aea1d51e2b5/0_333_3792_2275/3792.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2275,"width":3792,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An ambulance backs up to the military plane carrying US secretary of state John Kerry at Logan International Airport in Boston on Monday Photograph: Michael Dwyer/Associated Press","credit":"Michael Dwyer/Associated Press","altText":"An ambulance backs up to the military plane carrying US secretary of state John Kerry back to Boston","cleanCaption":"An ambulance backs up to the military plane carrying US secretary of state John Kerry at Logan International Airport in Boston on Monday","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Michael Dwyer/Associated Press"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T03:37:02Z","lastModified":"2015-06-02T06:41:20Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":26,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["US news","Iran's nuclear programme","John Kerry","World news","Cycling","US foreign policy"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/irans-nuclear-programme","webTitle":"Iran's nuclear programme"},{"id":"us-news/john-kerry","webTitle":"John Kerry"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling"},{"id":"us-news/us-foreign-policy","webTitle":"US foreign policy"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jun/02/broken-leg-wont-hobble-iran-talks-says-us-as-john-kerry-flies-back-for-surgery","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49d8m","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jun/02/broken-leg-wont-hobble-iran-talks-says-us-as-john-kerry-flies-back-for-surgery","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jun/02/broken-leg-wont-hobble-iran-talks-says-us-as-john-kerry-flies-back-for-surgery"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/2e7cce6d03619920bac49c3f761d4d31cce7b4e4/0_140_3507_2106/3507.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2106,"width":3507,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"US secretary of state John Kerry (on right) rides his bike during a break from nuclear negotiations with Iran, in Lausanne, Switzerland, in March.

The report underscored the challenges that Google and most other major technology companies face as they try to add more women, black people and Hispanics to their payrolls after many years of primarily relying on the technical skills of white and Asian men.</p> \n<p>“Early indications show promise but we know that with an organisation our size, year-on-year growth and meaningful change is going to take time,” said Nancy Lee, Google’s vice-president of people operations.</p> \n<p>Only 18% of Google’s worldwide technology jobs were held by women at the beginning of 2015, but that was up a percentage point from 2014.
