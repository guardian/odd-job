His family assumed he had gone for a coffee and cigarette in the cafe, as usual. </p> \n<p>Khalifa would sometimes join his own friends, the more conservatively minded Salafists with their loose gowns and square-cut beards. According to his family, Khalifa, who worked as a watchman for an oil services company, adopted a more conservative appearance a few months ago.</p> \n<p>By 3am, when the brothers usually shared a snack, neither had returned. The following evening, on 7 July, the family received a text message saying simply: “We are in Libya and everything’s fine.” <br /></p> \n<p>By then it was clear that the two missing brothers were not alone. News travels fast in this sleepy desert town and locals soon realised that 33 people, including one woman, had simply disappeared.</p> \n<p>They are all believed to have crossed the border into Libya, just half an hour’s drive away across an arid semi-desert landscape. The police have reported six arrests in connection with the exodus.</p> \n<p>The episode has underlined fears in Tunisia that extremist propaganda has encouraged growing numbers of disenchanted young people to cross the border into Libya. </p> \n<p>Tunisia is already the largest single source of foreign fighters in Iraq and Syria, but analysts have warned of an increasing flow of volunteers for jihad closer to home. Last week, UN representatives in Tunisia reported that 4,000 Tunisians had travelled to Syria and as many as 1,500 had joined jihadigroups in Libya.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/30/tunisia-beach-attack-seifeddine-rezgui-libya-bardo-museum-attackers\">Tunisia gunman trained in Libya at same time as Bardo museum attackers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Official concern has mounted sharply since the attacks at the Bardo museum in March and the Imperial Marhaba hotel in Sousse on 26 June. According to Tunisian investigators, the three gunmen involved in the attacks, which claimed the lives of 58 foreign tourists and one Tunisian policemen, had all received basic weapons training in Libya.</p> \n<p>Candidates for jihad may come from various backgrounds, but the neglected interior regions are inevitably fertile recruiting grounds for the Islamists.</p> \n<p>The group that left Remada included two serving members of the armed forces and one army deserter, according to the authorities. They were aged between 16 and 35. Three of the men had appeared in court just a few days earlier on terrorism-related charges but were released.</p> \n<p>Another member of the group, Hachemi Hsiss, 26 and unemployed since leaving school, had been questioned on 24 June by police, not for the first time, about his conservative Islamist lifestyle. His brother Farhat said he saw Hachemi mistreated in police custody before being accused of assaulting a police officer. A magistrate had fixed a date for a court hearing in October.</p> \n<p>Abdallah Ben Yahia said he was worried about his two brothers. The older of the two, Ahmed, had once dreamed of going to work abroad, in the gulf or Europe. Instead, he found himself stuck in a dead-end job and, at 35, still had not saved enough money to get married. Over the past few months, he had grown increasingly withdrawn, his brother said.</p> \n<p>“I interpret his decision to leave as something like a suicide attempt,” Abdallah said.</p> \n<p>The Tunisian defence ministry is reinforcing its border with a sand embankment and trench, running inland from the Mediterranean in order to discourage traffic along the desert tracks that are also used by smugglers. On Tuesday, the ministry announced that the line would extend for 135 miles (220km) in total, taking it 40km beyond the Dehiba crossing.</p> \n<p>“What you need to understand is that people decide to leave for all kinds of reasons,” said Mokhtar Lasoued, whose 18-year-old brother Hamza disappeared last week. “Some are just fed up with the poverty and unemployment here; the arrogance of the north [of Tunisia] towards the south.</p> \n<p>“My brother had no religious tendency at all. We need to see concrete results here, in terms of jobs. Digging a ditch between the two countries isn’t going to do it.”</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/376b138fa6875d1822ce615cd56377d94afc8871/0_59_3215_1928/3215.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1928,"width":3215,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"hamideddine Bouali/hamideddine Bouali /Demotix/Corbis","altText":"People cross through Customs Checkpoint at Tunisian-Libyan Border.

For months, some Syrian opposition members have been floating this idea as well, preferring it as a way of moving forward while avoiding a post-Saddam scenario, when the US dismantled the military and the entire government in Baghdad. It is a workable solution if Syrian opposition is well represented in the new, transitional government. Iran may also prefer this solution because it puts an end to a seemingly endless war, yet it maintains Tehran’s leverage over Damascus.</p> \n<p>Already Turkey is calling on Iran to step up to this challenge.</p> \n<p><strong>Lebanon </strong></p> \n<p>Sometimes referred to as a country that is too small to succeed and too small to fail, Lebanon has all but lost its sovereignty entirely.

Most of the Syrian refugees are Sunni Arabs, and many are not poised to return home to Syria anytime soon. How this disruptive demographical change will play out in a country born sectarian since its independence from the French Mandate in 1943 remains to be seen. (Lebanon follows a confessional system where each sect is represented by a pre-set number of representatives in parliament, and Lebanese citizens can vote only according to sect.)</p> \n<p>The more immediate questions is how will Iran manage the rising dissent toward and within the ranks of Hezbollah over the militia group’s involvement in Syria’s war? Hezbollah supporters are enduring a growing number of casualties as their sons return in coffins after fighting alongside Assad’s forces in Syria. Hezbollah has been wary of Sunni-backed militants that threaten “to bring the war to Lebanon” if Hezbollah doesn’t get out of Syria. All this is unfolding in a country that has become strained to its limits, with worsening public services, inflation so high that most locals rely on remittences from relatives living abroad, and an unemployment rate so high that you hardly meet a young Lebanese not looking to emigrate.</p> \n<p><strong>Saudi Arabia</strong></p> \n<p>Beside Israel, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/jan/30/iran-media-reacts-to-saudi-king-succession\">Saudi</a> is perhaps the most clear loser. For the Saudis, an Iran deal goes above and beyond concerns for regional security. The new alliance between the US and Iran is a direct affront to Saudi’s tribal sensibilities, enough reason to snub the west all together.</p> \n<p>The Saudi king has not yet issued a direct public statement in reaction to the news, but the country’s stance can be gauged from what its government-sanctioned journalists and analysts are saying</p> \n<p>“Iran made chaos in the Arab world and will extend further after the agreement, and the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) countries should reduce their confidence in America and turn their focus to Russia and China,” Mohammed al-Mohya, the news anchor on the state-run Saudi Channel 1, told The New York Times. He echoes a common sentiment in the Kingdom.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Saudi Arabian forces continue to pound Yemen in violation of a UN-brokered truce. Yemen perhaps best tragically captures the proxy wars between Saudi and Iran, as the country has been completely destabilized since Iran-supported Houthi rebels ousted the Saudi-friendly government in Sanaa earlier this year, prompting the fierce reaction from Riyadh.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436902840227/00de2f86-3841-4fb9-8822-34423a23270e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Reuters","altText":"Laszlo Balogh/Reuters","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T20:42:03Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T23:03:39Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Iran","Syria","US foreign policy","Saudi Arabia","Lebanon","Middle East and North Africa","US news","World news","Bashar al-Assad","Turkey","Hezbollah","Media"],"tags":[{"id":"world/iran","webTitle":"Iran"},{"id":"world/syria","webTitle":"Syria"},{"id":"us-news/us-foreign-policy","webTitle":"US foreign policy"},{"id":"world/saudiarabia","webTitle":"Saudi Arabia"},{"id":"world/lebanon","webTitle":"Lebanon"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/bashar-al-assad","webTitle":"Bashar al-Assad"},{"id":"world/turkey","webTitle":"Turkey"},{"id":"world/hezbollah","webTitle":"Hezbollah"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Tehran Bureau","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/series/tehran-bureau"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2015/jul/14/arab-states-react-iran-nuclear-deal","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak5d","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/iran-blog/2015/jul/14/arab-states-react-iran-nuclear-deal","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2015/jul/14/arab-states-react-iran-nuclear-deal"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436902840227/00de2f86-3841-4fb9-8822-34423a23270e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A migrant boy from Syria rests on a road after crossing illegaly the border of Serbia to Hungary, near Asotthalom, Hungary on 14 July 14, 2015.

\n<p>Members of the Afghan high peace council sat down with Taliban cadres last week in Murree, a tourist town in the hills north of Islamabad, for their first official talks to try to end the militants’ bloody fight, now in its 14th year.</p> \n<p>They agreed to meet again in the coming weeks, drawing praise from Kabul, Islamabad, Beijing, Washington and the UN.</p> \n<p>Although some commanders were optimistic, many others were deeply wary.</p> \n<p>The split in responses, with some commanders openly questioning the legitimacy of the Taliban negotiators in Murree, underscored the potentially dangerous faultlines within the movement, particularly between the older leadership and younger.</p> \n<p>In the statement, Omar sought to dispel any notion of a split.</p> \n<p>“All mujahideen and countrymen should be confident that in this process, I will unwaveringly defend our legal rights and viewpoint everywhere,” he said, adding that the purpose of talks was to “bring an end to the occupation” of Afghanistan.</p> \n<p>Several informal meetings have been held in recent months between Taliban representatives and Afghan officials and activists, but last week’s meeting is seen as a significant step forward.<br /></p> \n<p>Afghan officials have not said when and where the next round of negotiations will take place, but it is widely expected to be conducted after Eid.</p> \n<p>Wednesday’s statement marks the first comments on the process from Mullah Omar, about whom rumours of ill-health and even death regularly emerge.<br /></p> \n<p>In the absence of a clear lead from the top, some fighters have fallen back on the Taliban’s traditional position: that there can be no meaningful talks until all foreign forces leave Afghan soil.</p> \n<p>NATO ended its combat mission in Afghanistan at the end of December, but a smaller residual force remains to train Afghan forces, due to leave altogether by the end of 2016.</p> \n<p>Divides within the Taliban between those for and against talks have been made worse by the emergence of a local branch of the Islamic State (Isis).</p> \n<p>The Taliban warned Isis last month against expanding in the region, but this has not stopped some fighters, inspired by the group’s success, defecting to swear allegiance to Isis chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi instead of the invisible Mullah Omar.</p> \n<p>US drone strikes over the past week have killed dozens of suspected Isis-linked cadres in Afghanistan, including the group’s Afghanistan-Pakistan regional chief, Hafiz Saeed.</p> \n<p>The notoriously uncompromising Isis has shown no desire to negotiate, and if the Taliban faultlines widen there is a danger the talks process could drive more of its hardline fighters into its arms.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/28858f6230ead6ad7387fad0c09ea2b23d08714d/0_77_3424_2055/3424.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2055,"width":3424,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Anil

An attorney for the family called it a cold-blooded killing of an unarmed man. <br /></p> \n<p>It was only on Tuesday, more than two years after the fatal encounter, that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/video/2015/jul/15/gardena-police-shooting-los-angeles-video\">the videos were released</a>. US District Judge Stephen Wilson said there was a public interest in seeing the material and that records should be kept under seal in federal court only in extreme cases.</p> \n<p>“The fact that [the authorities] spent the city’s money, presumably derived from taxes, only strengthens the public’s interest in seeing the videos,” Wilson wrote in a 13-page decision. “Moreover, defendants cannot assert a valid compelling interest in sealing the videos to cover up any wrongdoing on their part or to shield themselves from embarrassment.”</p> \n<p>The city of Gardena had paid $4.7m to settle a civil rights lawsuit with the dead man’s family and Eutiquio Acevedo Mendez, the other man wounded in the shooting, but blocked release of the videos.</p> \n<p>On Tuesday, Gardena immediately filed a notice of appeal with the 9th US circuit court of appeals, which hours later issued a stay suspending the release of the videos. But they remained available online.<br /></p> \n<p>Lawyers for the Associated Press, the Los Angeles Times and Bloomberg had lobbied for their release, citing a first amendment right to access court documents, in the wake of intense public scrutiny of police shootings nationwide.</p> \n<p>“We applaud the court’s decision to unseal the video,” said AP spokesman Paul Colford before the stay. “The Associated Press, joining with other news organizations, believes it’s important that the public has access to videos like this to better understand the actions of their police officers.”</p> \n<p>Diaz Zeferino had been out in Gardena, a suburb of Los Angeles, on the early morning of 2 June 2013 seeking his brother’s stolen bicycle.<br /></p> \n<p>Police investigating a bicycle theft from outside a CVS drugstore stopped two men riding bicycles east on Redondo Beach Boulevard, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-federal-judge-orders-release-of-videos-20150714-story.html?14369191098620 \">according to the LA Times</a>, citing a district attorney’s memo written by a prosecutor who reviewed the police videos.<br /></p> \n<p>The men were friends of the bike theft victim and were searching for the missing bicycle. Mistaking them for the thieves, Sergeant Christopher Cuff ordered them to put their hands up. Diaz Zeferino ran up and intervened on behalf of his friends, shouting at Cuff he had the wrong men.</p> \n<p>Cuff yelled back in English and Spanish for him to step back, said the memo. Diaz Zeferino raised his hands, pounded his chest with both hands and reached to his waistband, said the memo. Two more police cars arrived and three officers emerged with guns drawn.</p> \n<p>Diaz Zeferino raised his hands, then repeated the move and removed something from his left rear pocket, the memo said. “You do it again, you’re going to get shot,” yelled an officer on the video, according to the memo. Diaz Zeferino removed his baseball hat and lowered his hands. As he began to raise his hands again, the officers opened fire, the memo said.</p> \n<p>An autopsy found he had methamphetamine and high levels of alcohol in his system.</p> \n<p>The Los Angeles county district attorney decided the shooting was justified and did not charge the officers. Lawyers for the officers said they could not see one of Diaz Zeferino’s hands and believed he was going to reach for a weapon.</p> \n<p>The city of Gardena said it resisted releasing the videos because they would create a “rush to judgment” about the officers’ actions. Police chiefs and officer groups around California supported the city, saying making such videos public would deter police from using such technology.</p> \n<p>Lawyers for Diaz Zeferino said the investigation into the shooting was tainted because officers were able to review the videos before giving statements. They said the recordings showed that officers opened fire even though it was clear the men were unarmed.</p> \n<p>Attorney Samuel Paz said they may ask federal prosecutors to investigate whether the shooting was a civil rights violation.</p> \n<p>“I think it is really helpful for the public to understand why they would be willing to pay $4.7m to settle the case when we were on the eve of trial,” Paz told the Associated Press. “When the public sees the video and other law enforcement agencies see the video, this is very much a criminal act.”</p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436931741821/371b11d6-4f63-4ff7-ade3-df5a8c985676-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AP","altText":"In a frame from the Gardena police dashcam video, officers aim their guns at Ricardo Diaz Zeferino, right, and two friends while investigating a bicycle theft.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-15T03:55:14Z","lastModified":"2015-07-15T03:57:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":97,"contributors":[{"name":"Rory Carroll","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/11/14/1415969446486/Rory-Carroll-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rorycarroll"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["US policing","US news","Los Angeles"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/us-police","webTitle":"US policing"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/los-angeles","webTitle":"Los Angeles"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rory Carroll","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rorycarroll"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jul/15/ricardo-diaz-zeferino-video-of-shooting-by-los-angeles-police-made-public","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4akdz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jul/15/ricardo-diaz-zeferino-video-of-shooting-by-los-angeles-police-made-public","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/15/ricardo-diaz-zeferino-video-of-shooting-by-los-angeles-police-made-public"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457497619","source":"LA Times","durationInSeconds":66,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/15/150715Shooting_FromGAus/150715Shooting_FromGAus.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/15/150715Shooting_FromGAus-16x9.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436923892431/police-shooting-LA-001.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":640,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dash-cam video shows the police shooting of an unarmed man in Gardena, Los Angeles, in June 2013.

Beijing","body":"<p>The successful outcome of the Iran nuclear talks shows China’s mantra of relying on talks rather than sanctions and threatening force is the correct approach, and one that should be applied to North Korea, the Beijing government’s official newspaper has said.</p> \n<p> Under the deal sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and United Nations will be lifted in return for Iran agreeing to long-term curbs on a nuclear programme that the west suspects has been aimed at creating a nuclear bomb.</p> \n<p> China, one of the country’s involved in the negotiations with Iran, had long railed against unilateral sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and Europe, though it has supported UN ones, and had denounced threats of force.</p> \n<p> The People’s Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist party, said the talks sent a “message of hope” to the world that diplomatic efforts were finally able to pay off after more than a decade of tensions.</p> \n<p> “The facts show that dialogue and negotiation were the only correct and effective path to appropriately resolve the Iran nuclear issue, and that certain countries threatening to use force on Iran and imposing unilateral sanctions are not acceptable,” the newspaper said.</p> \n<p> China was one of the main upholders of the principle of seeking political resolutions, and the Iran talks proved the importance of this philosophy, it added.</p> \n<p> “It can be a positive reference for the handling of other regional hotspots, including the Korean peninsular nuclear issue,” the newspaper said in the commentary, published under the pen name Zhong Sheng, meaning Voice of China, often used to give views on foreign policy.</p> \n<p> Talks between North Korea, South Korea, the United States, Russia and Japan about Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions have stalled since North Korea walked away in 2009.</p> \n<p> The People’s Daily said China played a crucial role in making sure the Iran talks finally got over the line. “In the most difficult, last mile of the talks, when the deadline was first passed, it was China that solemnly declared: ‘We have bought a proposal and way of thinking to solve the problem’,” the paper said, without giving details.</p> \n<p> “People recognise that China’s proposal and way of thinking in bridging the differences between the parties was prominent and did not go unnoticed.”</p> \n<p> China and Iran have close diplomatic, economic, trade and energy ties, and the Chinese foreign minister, Wang Yi, has been active in pushing both Washington and Tehran to reach agreement on the nuclear issue.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/15/1436940744730/d7567b03-4c8a-491a-bf7e-9195cb380c6e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lee
