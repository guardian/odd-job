Others from that period show Saudi plans for an anti-Iran satellite TV channel to broadcast in Persian from Bahrain, and plans to disrupt Iranian channels.</p> \n<p>The cables show Riyadh often seems worried about any advantage for Tehran: one document explains that if an Arab summit conference were held as scheduled in Baghdad in 2012, it would mean “handing Iraq to Iran”. Cables also show efforts to back opponents of Nouri al-Maliki, the then Shia prime minister of Iraq, who was close to Iran.</p> \n<p>Correspondence from the embassy in Beirut shows contacts with the Lebanese Forces leader, Samir Geagea, over cash payments to ease financial problems. Geagea had publicly defended Saudi Arabia and opposed president Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and generally shown “readiness to do whatever the kingdom asks of him”, the cables say.</p> \n<p>Al-Akhbar, the Beirut newspaper that is publishing the documents with WikiLeaks, is a supporter of Assad and Iran’s Lebanese militia ally Hezbollah. The documents examined so far do not mention Saudi backing for anti-Assad rebels, most likely because these are handled by the country’s intelligence service.</p> \n<p>Correspondence from the Saudi embassy in London shows filming of protesters and a discussion of legal action against the Guardian over an <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2012/feb/27/saudi-arabia-protest-uprising-mujtahidd\">article by Saad al-Faqih</a>, an Islamist. An appearance by Faqih on Egypt’s ON TV channel brought a proposal to “find out how to co-opt it”. But the billionaire owner of the station, Naguib Sawiris, did not want to be “opposed to the kingdom’s policies” and he ordered that Faqih never be interviewed again.</p> \n<p>“The extent of Egypt’s ruling establishment’s self-prostitution to Saudi money is both embarrassing and unsurprising,” commented the writer Iyad al-Baghdadi, in one of many weekend social media reactions since the documents were released. Ala’a Shehabi, a Bahraini dissident concerned by the Saudi intervention in her country, called the trove a “rare insight into the most opaque regime in the world”.</p> \n<p>Toby Matthiesen, a Cambridge University academic, said: “For Saudi experts there is little surprising so far … but the details will hurt a lot of corrupt people.”</p> \n<p> The documents include several references to “hostile” media. An undated note describes the influence of journalists sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood on the Qatar-owned channel al-Jazeera, which has often fallen foul of the Saudis. The papers also show how in 2010 they purchased hundreds or thousands of subscriptions to publications in Damascus, Abu Dhabi, Beirut, Kuwait, Jordan and Mauritania in order to secure favourable coverage.</p> \n<p>Influence and money are recurring themes. Reports from Sana’a state that the proceeds of the sale of 3m barrels of oil given to Yemen in 2012 never reached the country’s treasury. Another document accuses Qatar of paying a Yemeni sheikh to foment rebellion in the army and to prevent the 2012 presidential election of Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi.<br /></p> \n<p>The Sydney Morning Herald <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/national/wikileaks-saudi-cables-reveal-secret-saudi-government-influence-in-australia-20150620-ght4kp.html\">found documents</a> with instructions from the Saudi government to its Canberra embassy relating to the payment of large subsidies to prominent Arabic newspapers and media organisations in Australia.</p> \n<p>The Sunday Times reported that a document in the cache showed Saudi Arabia was prepared to pay the BBC correspondent Frank Gardner &pound;1m in compensation after he was shot in Riyadh by al-Qaida. Gardner told the newspaper the compensation never materialised. </p> \n<p>On Sunday the Saudi foreign ministry spokesman Osama Nugali warned citizens not to “allow enemies of the state to achieve their intentions in regards to exchanging or publishing any documents,” many of which, he said, had been “fabricated in a very obvious manner”.</p> \n<p>WikiLeaks did not say where it obtained the documents, but it referred in a press release to Riyadh’s statement in May that it had suffered a breach of its computer networks – an attack later claimed by a group calling itself the Yemen Cyber Army. </p> \n<p>The Guardian has not been able to independently verify the authenticity of the documents.</p> \n<p><em>Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report.</em><br /></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434898717848/f4c6b2a0-7d24-4b15-a81d-83b1027dc8c2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Hassan Ammar/AP","altText":"King Abdullah","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Hassan Ammar/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T15:08:05Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T00:10:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Black","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ianblack"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Saudi Arabia","WikiLeaks","World news","Media","Middle East and North Africa"],"tags":[{"id":"world/saudiarabia","webTitle":"Saudi Arabia"},{"id":"media/wikileaks","webTitle":"WikiLeaks"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian Black","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ianblack"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/21/saudi-arabia-ignore-wikileaks-release","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4axpp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/21/saudi-arabia-ignore-wikileaks-release","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/21/saudi-arabia-ignore-wikileaks-release"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434898717848/f4c6b2a0-7d24-4b15-a81d-83b1027dc8c2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Saudi Arabia’s King Abdullah, who died in January.

He said his father had several medical conditions.</p> \n<p>“He was a great musician. I loved him and we will miss him,” Schuller, a bassist, said. “He had a great life, he lived his dream.”</p> \n<p>As a composer, Schuller wrote more than 200 compositions, including solo and orchestral works, chamber music, opera and jazz. His orchestral work, Of Reminiscences and Reflections, dedicated to his wife Marjorie Black, won the 1994 Pulitzer prize for music.</p> \n<p>Schuller, who was born on 22 November, 1925, in New York, came from a family of classical musicians. His grandfather was a conductor in Germany and his father was a violinist with the New York Philharmonic.</p> \n<p>Schuller developed into a virtuoso on French horn. As a teenager, he began playing with the American Ballet Theatre and Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in the forties, and then joined the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, where he remained until 1959.</p> \n<p>Schuller discovered a whole new musical world when he heard Duke Ellington on the radio one night while doing his high-school homework.</p> \n<p>“I said to my father, ‘You know, Pop, I heard some music – Duke Ellington – last night and that music is as great as Beethoven’s and Mozart’s,’” Schuller said in a 2009 NPR interview. “And he almost had a heart attack because that was a heretical thing to say.”</p> \n<p>Schuller’s newfound passion led him to frequent New York jazz clubs, where he became involved in the burgeoning bebop scene in the late 1940s. Although French horn was rarely used in jazz ensembles, Schuller began his jazz career as part of trumpeter Miles Davis’s group which recorded the seminal 1949-50 Birth of the Cool sessions, which fused jazz and classical techniques. </p> \n<p>He would go on to perform and record with such jazz greats as J.J. Johnson, Eric Dolphy, Dizzy Gillespie, Ornette Coleman and Charles Mingus.</p> \n<p>In the mid-1950s, he teamed up with the classically trained jazz pianist John Lewis, musical director of the Modern Jazz Quartet, to form the Modern Jazz Society in an effort to bring jazz and classical music together. Schuller felt musicians from both genres could learn from each other.</p> \n<p>During a 1957 lecture at Brandeis University, Schuller coined the term Third Stream to describe his vision of what would result if the two main streams of music in the US got married and begat a child. Schuller and Lewis introduced their Third Stream compositions on two Columbia albums, Music for Brass and Modern Jazz Concert in 1957-58.</p> \n<p>“When I started the whole thing in 1957 with the Third Stream ... it was extremely controversial,” Schuller said in a 2010 interview with jazz writer Mark Myers. </p> \n<p>“I was vilified on both sides. Classical musicians, composers and critics all thought that classical would be contaminated by this lowly jazz music, this black music. And jazz musicians and critics said, ‘My God, classical music is going to stultify our great, spontaneous music.’ It was all nonsense and ignorance, of course. Eventually the two came together anyway.”</p> \n<p>Schuller and Lewis also founded the Lenox School of Jazz in western Massachusetts, which brought over Coleman from the west coast for its summer program in 1959 shortly before the free-jazz pioneer made his history-making New York debut.</p> \n<p>By the 1960s, Schuller had largely given up performing to focus on composing, teaching and writing. He served as president of the New England Conservatory in Boston from 1967-77, where he established the first degree-granting jazz program at a major classical conservatory and instituted the Third Stream department with pianist Ran Blake as its chair. </p> \n<p>He also founded the New England Conservatory Ragtime Ensemble, which earned a Grammy award for best chamber music performance in 1973 for the album Joplin: The Red Back Book, and helped spur a ragtime revival. Schuller won two more Grammys for writing liner notes.</p> \n<p>In 1990, Schuller and David Baker founded and conducted the Smithsonian Jazz Masterworks Orchestra in Washington, DC, dedicated to performing and preserving American jazz masterpieces. He also helped put together an all-star orchestra and conducted a 1989 performance of the late jazz bassist Charles Mingus’s epic work Epitaph, which was also released on record. He regularly appeared as a guest conductor with orchestras.</p> \n<p>As writer, Schuller authored both educational works and jazz histories, including Early Jazz: Its Roots and Musical Development (1968) and The Swing Era: The Development of Jazz, 1930-1945. In 2011, he published the first volume of his autobiography, Gunther Schuller: A Life in Pursuit of Music and Beauty.</p> \n<p>Schuller’s major orchestral works include Symphony (1965), Seven Studies of Paul Klee (1959) and An Arc Ascending (1996). He composed two operas: The Visitation (1966), based on a Franz Kafka story; and the children’s opera The Fisherman and his Wife with text by John Updike, derived from the Grimm fairytale.</p> \n<p>His noted Third Stream-style compositions include Transformation for Jazz Ensemble (1957), Concerto for Jazz Quartet and Orchestra (1959) and Variants on a Theme of Thelonious Monk (1960).</p> \n<p>In 2008, Schuller was named a Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts, the nation’s highest jazz honor. Earlier this year, the MacDowell Colony, a prestigious artists’ residence program, awarded him its lifetime achievement award “for setting an example of discovery and experimentation” as a composer and teacher.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/75d7dc964f855cd0a8868281ed1c877bfde43588/0_777_3744_2246/3744.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2246,"width":3744,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian","altText":"Gunther Schuller","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T03:06:06Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T03:06:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Music","Jazz","Classical music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"music/jazz","webTitle":"Jazz"},{"id":"music/classicalmusicandopera","webTitle":"Classical music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/22/gunther-schuller-pulitzer-winning-jazz-and-classical-musician-dies-aged-89","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a27h","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jun/22/gunther-schuller-pulitzer-winning-jazz-and-classical-musician-dies-aged-89","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/22/gunther-schuller-pulitzer-winning-jazz-and-classical-musician-dies-aged-89"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/75d7dc964f855cd0a8868281ed1c877bfde43588/0_777_3744_2246/3744.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2246,"width":3744,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gunther Schuller wrote more than 200 compositions, including solo and orchestral works, chamber music, opera and jazz.

The new search area prompted fierce media interest on Saturday evening but by Sunday afternoon there was still no confirmed sighting of the convicts and they were still at large.</p> \n<p>As darkness fell on Saturday, law enforcement personnel were forced to wind down their search of woods, culverts, railway tracks, roads, farmland and hamlets. Officers were still traveling to the area. Helicopters with infrared cameras that detect body heat continued the search into the night.<br /></p> \n<p>By Sunday, the FBI, forest rangers, local and state police and corrections officers from a number of prisons in the region were striving to establish a secure perimeter of personnel and, they hoped, close in on Matt and Sweat.</p> \n<p>Authorities put residents in the area on high alert as heavily armed police responded to the report of footprints and two men near a railway track and searched by foot, vehicle and helicopter, with dog teams and staff on all-terrain vehicles.</p> \n<p>Friendship is close to the border between New York and Pennsylvania, in Allegany County.</p> \n<p> The police warned local citizens not to approach anyone they thought might be the two men as they were considered highly dangerous, although it was not known if they were armed.</p> \n<p>As the hunt began to be scaled back around Dannemora in recent days and officials admitted they had no idea where the two inmates were, the new sighting was reported. New York state police have investigated more than 600 tips and leads since 6 June, but after a short time on Saturday evening they described the sighting near Friendship as “credible” and began channeling officers to the area.</p> \n<p>Matt and Sweat had expected a prison worker, Joyce Mitchell, to arrange their getaway from Dannemora, but Mitchell panicked and did not turn up, leaving the inmates to fend for themselves.</p> \n<p>Mitchell, 51, was questioned and then arrested on 12 June and charged in connection with smuggling tools to the inmates and assisting their breakout. </p> \n<p>A corrections officer was also being investigated after being taken in for questioning on Friday night.
