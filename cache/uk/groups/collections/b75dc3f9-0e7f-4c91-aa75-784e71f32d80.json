Everything here is changing constantly.”</p> \n<p>Built in the Stalinist Empire style, Luzhniki was opened in 1956 as the Central Lenin Stadium and hosted the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2006/feb/24/past.Olympics2012\">summer Olympics in 1980</a>. A 25-foot-high statue of Lenin still dominates the entrance, but the interior has been scooped out like an egg yolk, currently leaving only the facade and parts of the roof intact.</p> \n<p>It looks unpromising, but officials are confident they are well ahead of schedule in preparing this upgraded stadium – and 11 others across Russia – for a World Cup which kicks off exactly three years on Sunday. “Our preparations are going very well, much better than in some other World Cup countries,” the deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich told the Guardian. “We have learned from them.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I’m scared to think what could happen; that they could deny us the right to hold the World Cup</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Vladimir Leonov, Tatarstan sports minister</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Few doubt the stadiums will be ready. But will they hold the matches? The FBI’s announcement last week that it was expanding its investigation into corruption at Fifa to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/may/27/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-live\">include the selection process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups</a> brought fresh calls to strip Russia and Qatar of the events, provoking an angry response from both countries. <br /></p> \n<p>Publicly, officials in Moscow are sanguine, dismissive even, about the threat of a Fifa rethink on the 2018 award. But they also know that if the unthinkable does happen, it will mean an awful lot of effort – and money – has been spent in vain.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ba79525bb6bfd09e3d7463418d7a43d5a8f3d9b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433867599035/02d29266-c0f1-4165-9a4d-bae9e9ccf598-460x320.jpeg\" alt=\"Russian president Vladimir Putin and Fifa president Sepp Blatter listen to Moscow’s mayor Sergey Sobyanin at Luzhniki stadium in October 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"320\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian president Vladimir Putin and Fifa president Sepp Blatter listen to Moscow’s mayor Sergey Sobyanin at Luzhniki stadium in October 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ria Novosti/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It would be unpleasant,” Akhmadiyev said, with typical understatement. “I’ve put so much of my soul, so much of my strength into this. But I don’t worry because I will have built a great field. Russia will have something to be proud of.”</p> \n<p>Cancelling the event would inevitably bring legal action, with Russia seeking hefty compensation from Fifa. At least 40% of the $11bn World Cup construction programme – including stadiums, training facilities, transport infrastructure and hotels – is either under way or has been completed, the Russian organising committee told the Guardian this week. Luzhniki stadium alone is costing $400m to rebuild. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2423eb4b1d0e3868512e0e89f5feca69f193e2fc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859366929/d15bc199-d902-4843-b4fe-332f70646726-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Murat\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murat Akhmadiyev surveys his crews working on Luzhniki stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Rice-Oxley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For now, the work continues at an impressive pace. On Tuesday, Fifa secretary general J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Valcke arrived at the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jeromevalcke/status/608245411279699968\">newly built airport in Samara</a> and pronounced that building works on the stadium there “are well under way and on schedule”. Three of the 2018 World Cup’s 12 venues have been built so far, seven more are under construction, with two yet to be started. The stadium in Kazan, capital of the central Tatarstan republic, was completed in 2013 and has already hosted games for the local Rubin Kazan squad. Last August, surrounded by a bevy of young footballers, President Vladimir Putin <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2014/08/27/uk-soccer-world-russia-stadium-idUKKBN0GR1II20140827\">opened Otkrytie Arena</a>, the other Moscow World Cup venue and new home of the Spartak club. </p> \n<p>Some 1,500 workers at Luzhniki have been labouring around-the-clock and the stadium’s reconstruction will be completed next year, Akhmadiyev said, adding that 86,000 of a planned 101,000 cubic metres of concrete had already been laid. The upgraded stadium will hold 81,000 spectators and boast an LED light display across the roof showing the score and national flags to those outside the stadium.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I don’t see any problem: everything is going according to plan, everything’s moving along</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Sports minister Vitaly Mutko</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The project is a labour of love for many who work on it. “I think of the structures I build as living things,” Akhmadiyev said. “You start with the skeleton. When the utilities, water, electricity are put in, it’s like arteries and nerve endings. Then when it all works, the baby has been born.”</p> \n<p>Anastasia Ipatova, a communications specialist for the state-owned Luzhniki reconstruction company, has lived near the stadium for 11 years. She used to go to football matches there with her father, and jogs on the paths in the park around it: “Of course it will hurt if the stadium is not used for what it’s being built for,” she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"44054afcd66cabad78df5995a09722101d0a50ec\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433867785276/0ae5d497-35ea-49c4-8ccc-e64fbbd7fee1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Luzhniki stadium is due to host the final of the World Cup on 15 July 2018.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luzhniki stadium is due to host the final of the World Cup on 15 July 2018.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alexander Zemlianichenko/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The official budget for infrastructure and related measures for Russia’s World Cup is 660bn roubles ($10.8bn), including government and private investment. But if last year’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/winter-olympics-2014\">Sochi winter Olympics</a> is any indication, the actual amount being spent is higher (the initial budget for the Sochi games was $12bn but the final cost was estimated at $50bn). Already the cost has increased since Putin’s first estimate when Russia won the bid in 2013.</p> \n<p>The 2018 World Cup’s organising committee said it couldn’t say exactly how much had been spent so far – but Russian officials maintain that work is too far along to cancel the event. “We are deep in the process of preparing. We already spent a lot of money,” organising committee head Alexei Sorokin said in a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-33028673\">recent television interview</a> at Luzhniki. </p> \n<p>“I don’t see any problem: everything is going according to plan, everything’s moving along,” sports minister Vitaly Mutko told the Guardian last week.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7399eb1bb8563f48a36af9616f006f1c9251c5a1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433861314240/1995f37c-ec15-4022-a9f9-105db90c7ce5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Artist’s impression of the upgraded Luzhniki.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An artist’s impression of the upgraded Luzhniki.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Rice-Oxley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Economic jitters have resulted in plans being both accelerated and trimmed back. After the rouble lost more than half its value and inflation began skyrocketing in 2014 amid low oil prices and western sanctions, construction materials also started to get more expensive, deputy Moscow mayor Marat Khusnullin said this month. As a result, Moscow city hall decided to begin round-the-clock work and take other measures to speed up Luzhniki’s construction, which will now finish building <a href=\"http://www.sport-express.ru/football/world/2018/news/883389/\">three months earlier than planned</a>, according to Khusnullin. </p> \n<p>Against that, Russia’s World Cup organisers are <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/russia-world-cup-plans-hampered-by-economy-amid-fifa-scandal/523057.html\">considering cancelling plans for 25 luxury hotels</a>, and rail projects have also been scaled back. In 2013, state-owned Russian Railways head Vladimir Yakunin had said he hoped to build a high-speed rail line between Moscow and Kazan in time for the World Cup, but late last year admitted that it <a href=\"http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2619667\">wouldn’t be ready in time</a>. Only the two existing high-speed train lines – from Moscow to St Petersburg and Moscow to Nizhny Novgorod – will be able to transport World Cup fans to regional venues. The train to Yekaterinburg, the farthest flung host city, takes more than 26 hours from Moscow.</p> \n<p>Even if corruption is found in the 2018 selection process, Fifa surely can’t take the World Cup away from Russia until after Blatter is replaced – on 16 December, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/33073906\">according to the BBC</a>. By then, construction will be further along, and such a decision would almost certainly prompt Russia to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport – with any compensation claim starting at $4.7bn or more.</p> \n<p>“We won’t lose as much as other cities because the infrastructure is already built here,” Vladimir Leonov, sports minister for the Tatarstan republic, told the Guardian this week. “But it’s a big honour to hold such a tournament in your city, region and country. I’m scared to think what could happen; that they could deny us the right to hold the World Cup.”</p>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858464056/4447f26b-b8a4-4a36-a8a5-27d265d92617-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mark Rice-Oxley/MRO","altText":"Luzhniki stadium, Moscow","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mark Rice-Oxley/MRO"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433867598185/02d29266-c0f1-4165-9a4d-bae9e9ccf598-2060x1431.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1431,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Russian president Vladimir Putin and Fifa president Sepp Blatter listen to Moscow’s mayor Sergey Sobyanin at Luzhniki stadium in October 2014.

She will live with a foster family, for the foreseeable future. </p> \n<p>Maryam Uwais, a lawyer based in Nigeria who has been following the case contacted the Guardian to say she had spoken to Tasi’u shortly after her release, who is “overjoyed” at her new found freedom.</p> \n<p>“Apprehension, relief and then gratitude were emotions that were manifest today, upon the release of Wasila,” she said. </p> \n<p>“An entirely avoidable tragedy, leaving in its wake four dead men and a thoroughly traumatised little girl. Poison – the only feasible escape to freedom – devised from the wild imagination of a naive, depressed little girl caught up in a painful forced marriage to a much older man. A tough lesson for families, communities and a government that is still ambivalent about sanctioning the perpetrators of child marriage.”</p> \n<p>Ibrahim says her client, bubbly and full of life when she met her for the first time, has become more withdrawn, quiet and even depressed during her time in jail. Educational opportunities are limited in the prison in Kano city where she has been held, and to this day Tasi’u can neither read nor write.</p> \n<p>Throughout her trial, which was conducted in English meaning the defendant could not understand a word, Tasi’u was threatened with execution. Reporters in court described her struggling to control her emotions during proceedings, frequently breaking down in tears.</p> \n<p>In the weeks since Prosecutor Lamido Abba Soron-Dinki asked the high court in Gezawa, Kano state, to “terminate the case” of culpable homicide against Tasi’u in May, her visitation rights have been limited with even her family prevented from seeing her. Ibrahim’s lawyer has been stopped from taking her young teenage daughter to see Tasi’u, depriving the child of one of her few regular interactions with people her own age.</p> \n<p>“I think they were worried that she would try to escape,” said Ibrahim, when trying to offer an explanation for the cut in visiting rights, in the weeks after her release was first mooted.</p> \n<p>The case has drawn international condemnation from rights groups, who say the decision to pursue the death penalty against a teenager violates international law. Others have characterised Sani and Tasi’u’s relationship as one <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/27/wasilat-tasiu-death-sentence_n_6233832.html\">characterised by “systematic abuse”</a>.</p> \n<p>After a presentation was made to the court by Kano’s attorney general on Tuesday, calling for the defendant to be released, Judge Mohammed Yahaya agreed to drop the charges and allow Tasi’u to be free.</p> \n<p>In Nigeria, child marriage is common, despite national laws prohibiting it.</p> \n<p>The Child Rights Act, introduced in 2003, raised the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18, but the legislation has not been ratified by states in the Muslim-dominated north of the country where child marriage is common, with nearly half of girls married by the age of 15 and <a href=\"http://nigeria.unfpa.org/nigeirachild.html\">78%</a> by the time they hit 18.

One worker, whose name was blacked out of the court filing, told Cook in a 2012 message that Apple managers “are required to treat ‘valued’ employees as criminals”.</p> \n<p> Cook forwarded it to senior retail and human resources executives with the query, “Is this true?”</p> \n<p> The court filing does not include what responses Cook received. An Apple representative could not immediately be reached for comment.</p> \n<p> In the lawsuit, plaintiffs Amanda Friekin and Dean Pelle alleged that “screenings” or bag searches, designed to discourage theft, were being conducted every time sales reps left the store, including for meal breaks. The lawsuit, filed in the US district court for the northern district of California, seeks class action status.</p> \n<p> A US supreme court ruling in December 2014, in a case involving an Amazon warehouse contractor, handed a victory to employers, ruling that companies do not have to pay employees for the time they spend undergoing security checks at the end of their shifts. </p> \n<p>The supreme court found that because the screening process was not a “principal activity” of the workers’ jobs, under a federal labour law it was not subject to compensation.</p> \n<p> In the 2012 email to Cook, with a subject line “Fearless feedback from Apple retail specialist”, the employee said Apple’s policy implied the company did not trust its workers.</p> \n<p> “These procedures are often performed in front of gawking customers,” the employee wrote, and added that workers deserved to be treated with the same respect shown to customers.</p> \n<p> Another email, sent by a retail worker in Beijing to Cook and other managers in 2013, said Apple treated its employees “as animals” and thieves. It said an emergency exit in the store was blocked by Apple products.</p> \n<p> Cook’s response to that email was not displayed in the court filing, although other Apple executives did discuss the bag search policy.</p> \n<p>“If it is simply a deterrent there has to be a more intelligent and respectful way to approach,” wrote Denise Young Smith, Apple’s vice-president of human resources.</p> \n<p> A hearing in the lawsuit is scheduled for 2 July.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e878100539384fc53e3134739df4f737446d0b07/0_0_4056_2437/4056.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2437,"width":4056,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kimihiro Hoshino/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"(FILES) The Apple logo is seen in this September 11, 2012 file photo at the Yerba Buena Center for Arts in San Francisco.

Eye ointment, a musical mobile and a playpen cost 228 euros but the village allowance will cover the cost.</p> \n<p>“We live with my in-laws, with 800 euros a month,” says Nuno. “The town’s help is very important for us.”</p> \n<p>Alcoutim’s baby bonus is not the first of its kind in Portugal, but it is the most generous.<br /></p> \n<p>The scheme, which was set up in August, is modest in scale: six families are receiving payouts, which can be claimed until the child’s third birthday. </p> \n<p>The project appears to be bearing fruit: nine births are expected this year, compared with six last year. In 1995, 23 babies were born in Alcoutim.</p> \n<p>The mayor, Osvaldo Goncalves, says his goal is to “attract young people” to the hilly, riverside town “because without young people, there are no children”.</p> \n<p>And young people particularly suffered in the 2011 financial crisis that forced Portugal to accept a 78bn euro international bailout.</p> \n<p>Although its deficit is now under control and tourists are coming in record numbers, unemployment still stands at 13.7%, and among young people the rate is a third.</p> \n<p>Antonio, 34, and his partner, Jessica, 22, were the first couple in Alcoutim to benefit from the program, which has covered most of their daily expenses for nine-month-old Martim.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8a2ab4d989925c37129383f6659219d95c85ba99\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8a2ab4d989925c37129383f6659219d95c85ba99/0_266_3998_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Encarna&ccedil;&atilde;o Maria, 91, in Alcoutim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Encarna&ccedil;&atilde;o Maria, 91, in Alcoutim.

Jessica works at the daycare centre.</p> \n<p>But even the 5,000 euros “would not be enough for someone who really has nothing,” he says. </p> \n<p>Vanessa Cunha, researcher at the Portuguese observatory for families, agrees: “Certain regions in the country, particularly in the central part, are not ideal for young people who want to work and start families.” <br /></p> \n<p>The economic crisis and austerity measures “left many couples in precarious conditions and postponing plans to start families”, she says.</p> \n<p>Portugal’s slump in fertility rates is relatively recent, according to Eurostat, the EU’s statistics office. Ten years ago it still stood in the middle of EU states, with 1.41 births each woman.</p> \n<p>If the decline continues, the country could lose 20% of its population by 2060, dropping from 10.5m to 8.6m, Portugal’s national institute of statistics says.</p> \n<p>Lisbon’s centre-right government has been watching the local “baby schemes” and recently introduced several bills into parliament which are designed to help young parents nationwide: longer parental leaves, tax benefits and greater family allowances.</p> \n<p>“The state heard the alarms set off by the smaller communities,” Goncalves says.</p> \n<p>But Cunha says these initiatives, although helpful, are not the ultimate fix. </p> \n<p>Birth rate incentives “won’t be effective so long as the job market remains closed and uncertain,” she says.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6fc86d00a1fb3dfa7741c2124ed22bd2017a8985/0_248_4000_2399/4000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2399,"width":4000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Patricia de Melo Moreira/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY OLIVIER DEVOS\nDaniela Silva holds her son Santiago at her home in Alcoutim, southern Portugal on May 14, 2015.
