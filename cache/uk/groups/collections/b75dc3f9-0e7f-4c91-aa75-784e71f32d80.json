But around this time of year, the spacious prayer halls of Tehran’s gigantic Mosalla Grand Mosque are transformed into a labyrinth of stalls occupied by publishers exhibiting their latest titles. </p> \n<p>Offering generous discounts, some sell more books in 10 days than in the rest of the year. The fair attracts nearly 5 million visitors, dwarfing international counterparts such as Frankfurt. <br /></p> \n<p>All the books on display have been vetted before publication and some heavily censored, as is routine for every book printed in Iran. Visiting the fair this week the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, received a copy of Henry Kissinger’s On China in Farsi as a gift. Also on display is the Farsi translation of Hillary Clinton’s memoir, Hard Choices. <br /></p> \n<p>In parallel, however, is an unofficial Iranian book fair. It is online and free from the shackles of censorship that dominate the traditional publishing in Iran. <br /></p> \n<p>Iran is among the top 10 most censored countries, next to Saudi Arabia, Azerbaijan and China. However, the digital age is creating a new challenge to Iran’s censorship apparatus. An increasing number of writers and translators are turning to the internet to publish their work, instead of going through the tormenting line-by-line scrutiny required for print publication. A rise in paper prices has concomitantly driven more readers to buy ebooks. State TV has started labelling digital books as a new threat that should be taken seriously. <br /></p> \n<p>The ministry of culture and Islamic guidance is in charge of checking books. Anonymous censors, whose job is given the polite Persian word <em>momayezi</em> (evaluating), work round-the-clock to examine texts for anything that could be considered obscene, inappropriate or politically unacceptable. They are masters of finding a needle in a haystack yet no one knows who they are.</p> \n<p>Some censors are notorious for their “Ctrl+F” approach, the computer function that allows them to search for and delete blacklisted words such as kiss, dance, pork and wine. Others read books in full, not allowing anything to slip through. <br /></p> \n<p>But now there are digital alternatives to the old ways. <a href=\"http://www.nogaam.com/\">Nogaam</a>, an online Iranian publishing house, helps writers publish their work as ebooks that can be downloaded from Google Books or the publisher’s website. </p> \n<p>Its editor, Azadeh Iravani, said it had published 25 titles since 2013, mostly by authors who are living in Iran and know they have no chance of making it into print due to censorship. It is not clear what, if any, penalties writers could face for online publishing deemed unacceptable.<br /></p> \n<p>“If you’re in Iran and your book is rejected or censored to the bone then you had to either bin it or put it in a shelf to gather dust. So online publishers like Nogaam are giving people a new choice,” she said. <br /></p> \n<p>Among Nogaam’s books is a poetry collection by Payam Feili, who is openly gay. Titles are crowdfunded. Once the author is compensated, the book is available free for download.<br /></p> \n<p>They are also available in ePub format, readable on many book apps. A book by the satirist <a href=\"http://www.roozonline.com/english/author/name/ebrahim_nabavi-1.html\">Ebrahim Nabavi</a> has been downloaded at least 10,000 times. “It gives you a good experience of reading, it’s not like the old-fashioned scanned books that people could not read,” Iravani said. <br /></p> \n<p>James Marchant, the lead researcher behind a forthcoming report by the London-based <a href=\"http://smallmedia.org.uk/\">Small Media</a> on book publishing in Iran, called Writer’s Block, said with internet and smartphone penetration rates growing rapidly in Iran there was enormous potential for e-publishing to revolutionise the Iranian book market.</p> \n<p>“E-publishing in Iran is still in its infancy, and there remains a fair amount of scepticism among writers and publishers as to its potential benefits. Despite this uncertainty, diaspora organisations and self-publishing authors inside the country are starting to find some success marketing ebooks,” he said. <br /></p> \n<p>“There have been reports of self-published authors selling more than 10,000 copies of their books online, while diaspora publishers such as Nogaam are helping to share banned books with Iranian readers via e-pub formats.” </p> \n<p>In the words of Ali Asghar Ramezanpour, a former cultural ministry official, online publishing is “growing, and underground publishers are very active”.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The situation has got much better but I still have many books that are banned</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Mahmoud Dowlatabadi, writer</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Mahmoud Dowlatabadi, Iran’s most celebrated living writer, said restrictions had eased since Hassan Rouhani came to power but censorship still existed. However, he said the priority of Iran’s intellectual community was to help Rouhani bring Iran out of its international isolation. <br /></p> \n<p>“The situation has got much better but I still have many books that are banned.” Among them is <a href=\"http://hauspublishing.com/fiction/the-colonel\">The Colonel</a>, which has been published in English by Haus Publishing.</p> \n<p>Reza Shokrollahi from Khabgard, a famous Iranian literary blog, said censors were spending less time scrutinising books, but this did not imply they had become less meticulous. “It appears that censors receive their orders from people outside the ministry because even the minister and the president are critical of their approach.”<br /></p> \n<p>In his speech at the opening ceremony of Tehran’s international book fair, Rouhani said censors acted so arbitrarily that a book might get permission for publication for its first run but the second edition of the same book could be listed as banned. <br /></p> \n<p>Rouhani’s culture minister, Ali Jannati, said in 2013 that if the “Qu’ran was not sent from God, Iranian censors would have rejected it”. In a recent speech, he admitted that Iran’s policy of filtering the internet or blocking satellite channels had proved futile. “It’s like blocking the entire highway for the violation of a few cars,” he said. “The best way to control public opinion is to go with it not to fight it.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e16a00f3487ec547bfa683c5dee7cedbc24587f7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431610549383/1a3a40bb-d4bc-4658-b714-cb49ac833a22-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A chart from the Writer’s Block report shows minority language literature is massively under-represented in the Iranian publishing sector.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chart from the Writer’s Block report shows minority language literature is massively under-represented in the Iranian publishing sector.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.hands.media/books/\">H&amp;S Media</a> is another firm that specialises in digital distribution and on-demand publishing. Its director, Hossein Setareh, said it had published some 460 Iranian books since 2011, available on Google Books. At least half are also available on Kindle.<br /></p> \n<p>“One of the big problems we face is that Amazon and its Kindle reader don’t support Farsi language,” he said. “Also because of international sanctions people in Iran cannot buy our ebooks from Amazon or similar foreign-based sites.”</p> \n<p>Setareh’s firm instead has come up with a creative solution: users in Iran can donate a book’s price to a charity of their choice and send its receipt. They will then be allowed to download the book. Every month, at least 300 books are sold to readers in Iran using this method. <br /></p> \n<p>Seyedmostafa Raziei, a young writer and translator, is published in print in Iran but has released nine titles as ebooks, four of which are translations of Charles Bukowski’s poetry that could not get permission from the ministry. “Censorship is futile and we are not in the 20th century any more: people have access to the internet and it has no boundaries.” <br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://fidibo.com/\">Fidibo</a> is Iran’s biggest digital library but it features ebooks that have already received permission for publication. Its director, Majid Ghasemi, said it had published nearly 3,500 books online and has more than 150,000 users. Last year alone, books had been downloaded from Fidibo more than 200,000 times.

young Kim Jong-un’s leadership: first he <a

chief</a>. </p> \n<p>Recent reports that the once-powerful general, Hyon Yong-chol, had been executed by firing squad because he fell asleep in a meeting with the ruler have since been downplayed, with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/14/south-korea-rows-back-over-north-korea-anti-aircraft-gun-execution-claim\">South Korea saying he has been “purged”</a> but “not necessarily killed”. But both occurrences point to vulnerabilities at the very top of the DPRK.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/13/north-korea-execution-hyon-yong-chol-kim-jong-un\">Purges and political manoeuvres: how volatile is Kim Jong-un?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Cancelling the Russian trip because of “internal Korean affairs” raised questions of exactly <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/kim-jong-un-purges-paranoia-plots-and-the-beloved-leaders-cancelled-trip-to-moscow-41057\">what Kim is frightened of</a>. Has he realised that he cannot rely on the repetition of the Kim family myth alone for political legitimacy?</p> \n<p>Ongoing purges suggest that some of the elite have forgotten the volatility of the young Kim, displaying a lack of respect for the institutions that sustain him and unwillingness to indulge his need to be the focal point of all adulation. </p> \n<p>After two years of prefatory propaganda and three years of rule, it is revealing that analysts believe his authority is in question. “Internally, there does not seem to be any respect for Kim Jong-un within the core and middle levels of the North Korean leadership,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/13/north-korean-defence-minister-executed-by-anti-aircaft-gun-report\">said Michael Madden</a>, an expert at the 38 North thinktank.<br /></p> \n<p>If the reports are true, why should it be necessary for Kim to send such a piercing signal by removing a man who sat not just on the expanded politburo but also the all-powerful National Defence Commission?<br /></p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456707482__\n</div> \n<p>Surely the events of December 2013, when Kim Jong-un approved the purge and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2013/dec/13/north-korea-executes-kim-jong-un-uncle-jang-song-thaek\">execution of his own uncle</a>, should still be fresh in minds of North Korean elites. At that time, the maintenance of the Kim personality cult was cited by North Korean state media as <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2013/12/-thrice-cursed-acts-of-treachery-parsing-north-koreas-report-on-the-execution-of-kim-jong-uns-uncle/282339/] \">justification for Jang Song-taek’s execution</a>; the would-be regent was accused of applauding the leader with inadequate gusto at a meeting and putting an inscription in praise of Kim in the shade rather than in sunlight.</p> \n<p>In such a system, it is nearly impossible for figures other than Kim to accumulate public charisma or prestige. For all of his strange disappearances, evident health problems and unlikely friendships with Dennis Rodman, the ruler has been celebrated in state media as every bit the “peerlessly great man of Paektu” that his predecessors were. Lacking in any actual administrative expertise, Kim has traded fully upon his bloodline as his primary credential.<br /></p> \n<p>The young leader’s celebrated <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/gallery/2015/apr/20/kim-jong-un-north-korea-climb-mountain-in-pictures\">“climb” to the summit of Mount Paektu</a> this past month is a case in point: this was an occurrence which not just the whole of the armed forces but the entire nation was expected to celebrate. General Hyon and his counterparts were not immune to this directive, and it formed a central element in a concert they attended in Pyongyang on 28 April, which was to be Hyon’s last public appearance.</p> \n<p>There may be reasons for Hyon’s removal other than simple disrespect – he may have said or done something to embarrass the regime in Moscow, for instance, or have made <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/13/kim-jong-un-risky-game-north-korea\">inadequate preparations for Kim</a>’s safety on the young leader’s presumptive first foreign trip. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/13/kim-jong-un-risky-game-north-korea\">Why trigger-happy Kim Jong-un is playing a risky game in North Korea | Aidan Foster-Carter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But given what we know about how Kim operates and how he wishes to be perceived, it is more than possible that Hyon’s basic lack of interest in the personality cult is what led to his downfall. </p> \n<p>Kim’s uncle’s destruction was followed immediately by an ominous anthem of the new orthodoxy entitled “We will only follow you”, which men and women in factories and schools were expected to sing heartily, occasionally in front of cameras. This appears to have been repeated with a new song played by the Moranbong Band, to mandatory applause, praising his trip to the top of the holy mountain of his family’s myth.</p> \n<p>This renewed emphasis of the propaganda focusing on Mount Paektu serves as a reminder that only the man with the pure bloodline can rule the roost, while those close to him need to watch their backs.</p> \n<p></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431611992997/605f2154-ca74-4651-a164-3195ee67a449-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"KCNA/Reuters","altText":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visits the Anbyon fish farm under in a newly released but undated photograph.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: KCNA/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-15T04:00:05Z","lastModified":"2015-05-15T06:37:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":258,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Kim Jong-un","North Korea","South Korea","Asia Pacific","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/kim-jong-un","webTitle":"Kim Jong-un"},{"id":"world/north-korea","webTitle":"North Korea"},{"id":"world/south-korea","webTitle":"South Korea"},{"id":"world/asia-pacific","webTitle":"Asia Pacific"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"North Korea network","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/series/north-korea-network"},"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-456707482","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":32,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10361015&format=video/mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/13/150613northkorea.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/13/1431500945593/KP_222256_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Hyon Yong Chol - archive video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Hyon Yong Chol - archive video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Hyon Yong Chol - archive video"}}],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/may/15/north-korea-execution-kim-jong-un-rumour","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48qkh","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/may/15/north-korea-execution-kim-jong-un-rumour","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/15/north-korea-execution-kim-jong-un-rumour"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431611992997/605f2154-ca74-4651-a164-3195ee67a449-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un visits the Anbyon fish farm under in a newly released but undated photograph.

That will happen in the north-east corridor by the end of this year,” Boardman said at a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/14/amtrak-train-crash-philadelphia-driver\">press conference</a> with Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter.</p> \n<p>America’s sparse rail network is so far behind standards in countries that rely heavily on high-speed rail, such as the UK, France and Japan, that Nutter and commentators said <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/05/14/us/philadelphia-amtrak-train-derailment/\">on US TV</a> on Wednesday evening that they had never heard of positive train control until after the latest crash happened.</p> \n<p>Talking to CNN’s Wolf Blitzer, who said he had just heard about it for the first time, Nutter confessed that despite being a frequent rail traveler: “Until earlier today I had never heard of this thing in my life.”</p> \n<p>Many UK rail lines had various versions of a driver warning system going back to the fifties, with upgrades in later decades and top level systems on select high-speed lines. But by 2005 the bulk of the UK system had been fitted with the upgraded Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS), which Ford said had proved inexpensive and more efficient than many experts had expected, even prompting export sales.</p> \n<p>Ford said America’s PTC system was another version of such a system that “the US is struggling to get in” to its system.</p> \n<p>“It’s basic kit over here.
