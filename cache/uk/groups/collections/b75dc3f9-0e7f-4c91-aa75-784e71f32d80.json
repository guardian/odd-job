Militants with the group have not discussed the strikes online.</p> \n<p>Nato officials declined to immediately comment on the claim, saying they would issue a statement later Saturday. US army colonel Brian Tribus, a spokesman for US Forces-Afghanistan, confirmed Americans carried out an airstrike Friday in Nangarhar’s Achin District, but declined to comment further. </p> \n<p>Nato and US officials have not commented on Tuesday’s strike earlier discussed by Afghan officials.</p> \n<p>Isis, which holds a self-declared “caliphate” across roughly a third of Syria and Iraq, has inspired militants across the greater Middle East and Africa to declare allegiance to its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The militants include those in Egypt who purportedly claimed a car bombing early on Saturday at the Italian consulate in Cairo that killed one person.</p> \n<p>The US and its allies also carried out 34 air strikes against Isis militants in Syria and Iraq on Friday, the US military said. </p> \n<p>In Syria, targets near the city of Hasaka were hit in 12 of 17 strikes, a US military statement said on Saturday. The allied forces also carried out 17 air strikes near eight cities in Iraq, including four near the northern city of Mosul.</p> \n<p>They also include militants in Pakistan and Afghanistan, the target of a US-led invasion after the 2001 al-Qaida terror attacks on America.</p> \n<p>Disenchanted extremists from the Taliban and other organisations, impressed by Isis territorial gains and slick online propaganda, began raising its black flag in extremist-dominated areas of both countries in recent months.</p> \n<p>Analysts and officials say the number of Isis supporters in the Afghan-Pakistan region remains small and that the group faces resistance from militants with strong tribal links. However, the rise of even a small Isis affiliate could further destabilise the region and complicate US and Nato efforts to end the 13-year Afghan war.</p> \n<p>In April, a motorcycle-riding suicide bomber attacked a line of people waiting outside a bank in eastern Afghanistan, killing at least 35 and wounding 125 in an assault the country’s president blamed on Isis. Other violence has been blamed on the Islamic State affiliate, including gun battles between its followers and the Taliban, which warned Isis to stay out of the country. </p> \n<p>Afghan officials have suggested the Isis affiliate had a presence in three of its provinces, including Nangarhar, which borders Pakistan and frequently sees militants cross its borders.</p> \n<p>Sediqi, the National Directorate of Security spokesman, said Afghan officials had created a special intelligence unit to target the Isis affiliate and its work directly aided the US airstrikes.</p> \n<p>“Daesh activities have been totally disturbed here and it is not easy for them to replace all these high-ranking figures any time soon,” he said, using another name for Isis.</p> \n<p>Also on Saturday, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Syrian army airstrikes killed at least 28 people in the Isis-held town of al-Bab in northern Syria, including 19 civilians. The Local Coordination Committees group said the barrel bombings killed 29 people.</p> \n<p>Al-Bab is a frequent target of Syrian army strikes that often kill civilians. On 31 May, Syrian army airstrikes that hit a packed market in al-Bab killed around 70 people, most of them civilians.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/9/25/1411658465065/US-Air-Strikes-in-Syria-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Staff Sgt.

Stefanovic said the situation was dangerous, adding: “Bosnia failed to create even the minimal conditions for the safety of the prime minister.”</p> \n<p>Last Wednesday, Russia vetoed a United Nations resolution calling the events of 1995 genocide, a term that angers Serbia.</p> \n<p>Bosnian Serb and Serbian politicians have repeatedly contested the extent of the killing, despite the act being declared a genocide by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and the Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadžic and General Ratko Mladic awaiting verdicts in trials for directing genocide.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436635138589/Bodyguards-try-to-protect-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Aleksandar Vucic, Serbia’s prime minister, centre, is hurried away after stones were hurled at the funeral.

At the gate a whole section is taken up by a full-face painting of President Barack Obama looking into the distance and wearing a wistful expression.</p> \n<p>In the warrens of cubicles in the theatre, the star painting is an acrylic and oil portrait of Obama, seated on a still growing tree in a lime-green jungle, striking the pose of a Roman emperor with his shoeless feet dipping into a stream. “We are very excited about his visit,” says Evans Yegon, 30, who painted the portrait. “We are just curious to see how things will be and we just can’t wait.”</p> \n<p>Kenya is in the grip of Obama-mania. For weeks, newspapers have led with numerous articles describing preparations for the trip at the end of the month and analysing its importance. Readers have been inundated with every detail about efforts to keep Obama safe, with tales about his limousine, “a tank on four wheels” (the <em>Star</em>), a favourite.</p> \n<p>Roads have been relaid, malfunctioning street lights fixed, billboards erected and the highway between the airport and the central business district boasts a new garden – although social media users have been quick to note, witheringly, that the newly planted flowers are unlikely to have blossomed before Obama arrives.</p> \n<p>It is hard to overstate Obama’s popularity in Kenya, the land where his father was born, and in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, one of the few places where his <a href=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/24/7-charts-on-how-the-world-views-president-obama/ft_15-06-23-obama-africa/\" title=\"http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/06/24/7-charts-on-how-the-world-views-president-obama/ft_15-06-23-obama-africa/\">stock has remained undimmed</a> through the course of his presidency. Yet his visit to Kenya will also highlight the changing dynamics of the relationship between the west and a continent that has grown more assertive with improving economic fortunes at a time when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/global-development/2015/jan/12/china-denies-building-empire-africa-colonialism\" title=\"\">new powers, especially China, </a>are making a big play for prominence in Africa.</p> \n<p>At the airport, Obama will be received by Uhuru Kenyatta, whose presidential bid Washington semi-openly campaigned against because, at the time of the election in March 2013, he was facing indictment at the International Criminal Court for his alleged role in post-election violence that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2008/jan/28/kenya.international\" title=\"\">rocked the country at the end of 2007</a>. The case has since been withdrawn.</p> \n<p>The election of Kenyatta and his deputy, William Ruto, was seen as a significant embarrassment for western envoys who had warned the electorate that “choices have consequences” and their entry into office led to a deepening of Kenya’s relationship with China and strained ties with western allies.</p> \n<p>“This will be a very significant visit,” says Professor Winnie Mitullah of the University of Nairobi. “Relations with the west hit a low not witnessed for decades in recent years and it will be a chance, in effect, to reset the partnership and create a new narrative.”</p> \n<p>Some analysts say the rise of China has seen US administrations grow averse to criticising the governance and human rights records of governments in Africa. Campaigners complained that a summit of African heads of state in Washington last August focused on trade and security with little discussion on human rights, and many will be watching to see how Obama, whose strong words against official corruption in Kenya on his last visit as a senator in 2006 stirred a ruckus, will handle the issue.</p> \n<p>Scott Gration, a retired general and former US ambassador to Kenya who grew up in east Africa and was an early supporter of Obama’s presidential campaign, says Obama remains a champion of the good governance agenda but argues that US dealings with the continent have to reflect shifting dynamics. “I believe we are witnessing a change in the international community’s engagement with Africa. President Obama’s focus on entrepreneurs [he will attend a global entrepreneurship summit] continues the positive shift from historical political-military relationships in Africa to a new series of economic-centric associations on the continent. To be truly successful, his visit must translate into substantial results that are sustained beyond the visit itself.”</p> \n<p>Beyond the complex calculations of various actors, including some evangelical pastors and conservative MPs whose demands that Obama not advance <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jul/04/africans-love-america-cant-accept-gay-marriage\" title=\"\">the gay marriage agenda</a> have stirred national debate, most Kenyans are simply happy to host a man many see as one of their own. Nowhere is the excitement at a greater pitch than in K’Ogelo, the village in Siaya, a county on the fringes of Lake Victoria, where Barack Obama Senior grew up. “Obama is my brother,” said Michael Ochiel, 42, reflecting the tendency of many Africans to ascribe kinship to anyone from their locality. “By coming to Kenya he will put the country on the world map, making Kenyans all over the world a proud people. I hope he extends his visit to K’Ogelo.”</p> \n<p>Musa Ogilo, 67, a maize miller, said the area had witnessed a quick transformation since Obama became president, citing the levelling of roads and extension of the electricity grid to the village by local authorities. But he called on Obama to build a proper hospital in the village, illustrating the fact that many Kenyans struggle to distinguish between the president’s duty to US citizens and to the land of his father’s birth.</p> \n<p>Commentators caution that the excitement surrounding the visit may cloud the main objective – the global entrepreneurship summit, which the White House describes as an effort to gather entrepreneurs and investors from around the world with the aim of spurring economic opportunity.</p> \n<p>Despite its ethnicised and occasionally violent politics – and the growing menace of the al-Shabaab terror group which has carried out attacks and triggered fears it might try to disrupt the visit – Kenya boasts one of the best developed middle classes on the continent and has proved a big draw for US and European investors in recent years.</p> \n<p>A financial analyst, Aly Khan Satchu, says Kenyan authorities would make a mistake if they allowed themselves to be caught up in the excitement surrounding the trip, which he compared to John F Kennedy’s trip to Ireland in 1963, and passed up the opportunity to sell the country’s merits to the world: “Kenya, and Nairobi in particular, is globally fluent, has 21st-century connectivity and an impressive pool of human capital.”</p> \n<p>It’s a view echoed by Chad Larson, one of three co-founders of one of the most successful enterprises driven by the success of mobile money transfers in Kenya, M-Kopa. The business, incubated in part in chats between Larson and fellow students at Oxford University, sees users pay a deposit of about $35 for a solar system worth about $200 before settling the balance using mobile money transfers over a year.</p> \n<p>The firm has sold 200,000 systems in Kenya and Uganda since its launch in 2010 and shifts about 500 a day. “We could not have properly gotten off the ground without the support of international investors who were willing to allow us to try different iterations and ultimately succeed,” says Larson. “It would be great if more local Kenyan investors were willing to back local enterprises and support the next M-Kopa. I hope Obama’s visit is a catalyst for that.”</p> \n<p>Evans Yegon’s expectations are decidedly more straightforward. “I just hope I can reach him and that he takes this painting away with him.”</p> \n<p><em>Additional reporting by Nelcon Odhiambo</em></p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436557336439/Barack-Obama-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Senator Barack Obama holds his step-grandmother Sarah Hussein Onyango Obama on a visit to his ancestral rural village of Kogelo in Kenya in August 2006.

Psychologists still operate at Guant&aacute;namo, as part of the detention facility’s behavioral-health unit.</p> \n<p>That 542-page report, by former federal prosecutor David Hoffman, found that numerous senior officials within the APA aided torture by changing internal rules – and collaborated with defense personnel in doing so – to permit psychologists’ assistance. The APA further spent more than a decade denying it had opened the door to abuses; aggressively misrepresenting its collusion to the media and the public; and stifling internal dissent. </p> \n<p>Hoffman found that APA officials were motivated to collaborate with the Defense Department by “the very substantial benefits that DoD had conferred and continued to confer on psychology as a profession”. Collaboration was “enhanced by personal relationships between APA staff and DoD personnel”, including a marriage between an APA executive and “one of the military’s lead psychologists who supported interrogations at Guant&aacute;namo Bay”.</p> \n<p>Among the leading officials implicated was the APA’s ethics chief, Stephen Behnke. After the APA received the Hoffman report, Behnke departed his post on 8 July. Kaslow would not say if Behnke was fired or resigned. She indicated that “multiple personnel actions” were likely in the near future. </p> \n<p>The APA said that it would also undertake institutional reforms, including changes to its ethics and complaint-review policies, and Kaslow said the APA would need to be “open and transparent” with the media. </p> \n<p>On 6 August, the 130,000-member APA will meet in Toronto for its annual conference. The Hoffman report is expected to be the central topic of discussion. </p> \n<p>Beyond Toronto, Kaslow said the APA would deliver the Hoffman report to the Senate armed services and intelligence committees and the inspectors general of the Pentagon and the CIA. But she stopped short of committing to referring it to the FBI for potential criminal inquiry, saying Hoffman drew a line short of that in internal discussions. </p> \n<p>“The issue with the FBI is something we’re continuing to discuss,” she said.</p> \n<p>Stephen Soldz, a longtime critic of the APA’s involvement with torture, urged the APA to make such a referral in a meeting the APA held with its dissidents on 2 July in Washington. </p> \n<p>“We must refer this report and its findings to the FBI and we must cooperate fully in any ensuing investigation,” Soldz urged, according to a presentation acquired by the Guardian.</p> \n<p>Kaslow said the APA would begin embracing the anti-torture critics the organization had spent years marginalizing – particularly Jean Maria Arrigo, one of its leading internal reformers, whom the report says was repeatedly rebuffed in an “intentional effort to curb dissent”.</p> \n<p>“I’m going to personally thank her when I see her,” Kaslow said. “I’m going to personally apologize to her for the fact that other people mistreated her.” </p> \n<p>Kaslow indicated that the APA recognized it had much work to do to restore public confidence. </p> \n<p>“Certainly, this is a hit to our integrity, the organization’s integrity and, unfortunately, psychologists’ integrity, too,” she said. </p>","section":"US","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/059697896344c7bcccff029d67a27bca95e0780b/0_39_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images","altText":"US torture report","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-11T12:54:17Z","lastModified":"2015-07-11T20:18:16Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":313,"contributors":[{"name":"Spencer Ackerman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/4/1409842529387/Spencer-Ackerman-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/spencerackerman"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["US news","Guantánamo Bay","Torture","CIA torture report","CIA","World news","Law","September 11 2001"],"tags":[{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/guantanamo-bay","webTitle":"Guantánamo Bay"},{"id":"law/torture","webTitle":"Torture"},{"id":"us-news/cia-torture-report","webTitle":"CIA torture report"},{"id":"us-news/cia","webTitle":"CIA"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"law/law","webTitle":"Law"},{"id":"us-news/september11","webTitle":"September 11 2001"}],"section":{"id":"us-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Spencer Ackerman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/spencerackerman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"us-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/jul/11/cia-torture-doctors-psychologists-apa-prosecution","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ahza","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/us-news/2015/jul/11/cia-torture-doctors-psychologists-apa-prosecution","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/11/cia-torture-doctors-psychologists-apa-prosecution"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/059697896344c7bcccff029d67a27bca95e0780b/0_39_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"That 542-page report found that numerous senior officials within the APA aided torture by changing internal rules to permit psychologists’ assistance.
