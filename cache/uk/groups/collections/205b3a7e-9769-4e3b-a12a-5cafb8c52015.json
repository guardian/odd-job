She was surprised by some of the questions the Moscow police officers asked her when she recounted what had happened, her face still painfully swollen and discoloured.<br /></p> \n<p>“They asked me why I didn’t have any children,” she remembers. “They asked me if I was married.” Beneath their line of questioning was the suggestion that somehow the attack was her fault. </p> \n<p>They told her that they would investigate, but a few weeks later she received a letter informing her that the case had been dropped. Her ex-boyfriend had not been questioned and no further action was proposed. When she tried to hire a lawyer to start a private suit, she was told that the police had lost her files.</p> \n<p>Zhavnerovich, 28, a journalist at a fashionable Moscow-based online lifestyle website <a href=\"http://w-o-s.ru/\">W-O-S</a>, chose instead to write an article about what had happened to her. Its publication last month attracted huge attention, highlighting an issue that for decades has been an almost unmentionable taboo. Zhavnerovich was bombarded with hundreds of emails and Facebook posts from women who wanted to tell her that they, too, had been beaten up by partners and struggled to get the authorities to register a complaint. </p> \n<p>“I think people were surprised to read that this was happening in young, fashionable Moscow circles – not something to do with alcoholics in some remote, backward village somewhere. That’s why it triggered such a huge reaction from the public,” Zhavnerovich said. “Judging by the responses I have had, the scale of the problem is enormous.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Judging by the responses I have had, the scale of the problem is enormous</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Anna Zhavnerovich</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The interest her account provoked chimed with a political shift in attitudes to this issue, which is finally edging towards the political mainstream. After decades of failed attempts to draft legislation that identifies domestic violence as a crime, politicians at the Moscow Duma hope this session of parliament to debate a new law, which will make it easier for victims to prosecute their attackers, and introduce a series of preventative measures, such as restraining orders and behavioural therapy for offenders. </p> \n<p>Politicians have already considered (and abandoned) more than 50 draft versions of a law on domestic violence since the early 1990s, but this time there is muted optimism from campaigners, who say a series of high-profile cases are finally bringing this hidden issue into the open, strengthening demand for improvements in the way complaints from women are handled.</p> \n<p>The current debates over how Russia deals with domestic violence reflect changing attitudes to women, in a country where family values remain conservative. It touches on a perplexing Russian paradox – that while the Russian government has long promoted equality in the work place, attitudes towards women remain patriarchal. The UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, which was considering the issue of domestic violence, <a href=\"http://www.stopvaw.org/russian_federation\">expressed concern</a> in 2010 at the “state party’s repeated emphasis on the role of women as mothers and caregivers”.</p> \n<p>“If he beats you, he loves you,” goes a well-known Russian proverb, a wry articulation of an acceptance that being hit by your husband is simply an everyday part of human relationships. <a href=\"http://blogs.nysut.org/sttp/defenders/marina-pisklakova/\">Marina Pisklakova</a>, head of ANNA, a Moscow-based charity which has been fighting for improved support for victims of domestic violence since the 1990s, points out that the violence itself is a global problem, but that Russia is unusual in having such inadequate legislation. </p> \n<p>“We desperately need the legislation because when there is no legislation, it makes it look like this is something that is tolerated by society, so the legislation in itself will be a powerful statement that this is not something that is acceptable – and I think that will have an impact on behaviour,” she said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90ff20489afc8ddcc2e96d079d3b1e5d5cf718a4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/5/1433518471585/8451a3ad-f18f-42c0-95ca-b3f17cfa6c6b-460x400.jpeg\" alt=\"Russia’s children’s rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov, wrote: “excessive use of the term ‘domestic violence’ serves to intimidate families and parents”\" width=\"460\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russia’s children’s rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov, wrote: ‘Excessive use of the term “domestic violence” serves to intimidate families and parents’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Because there is no separate classification for domestic violence, there are no reliable statistics on prevalence, but the Ministry of Internal Affairs estimated in 2008 that it occurs in 25% of all families, and that <a href=\"http://www.stopvaw.org/russian_federation\">14,000 women die every year</a> “at the hands of husbands or other relatives”, with nearly 65% of all homicides related to domestic violence. </p> \n<p>“The reporting is very low. It is a very concealed issue,” Pisklakova said. “But things are changing; there is not as much denial as there was.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>14,000 Russian women die every year at the hands of husbands and relatives</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>President Vladimir Putin had indicated that he would support the bill, but elsewhere there has been hostility to the proposed legislation. A Russian orthodox archbishop, and Russia’s official children’s rights ombudsman, criticised groups campaigning on this issue in March, accusing them of disseminating “anti-family propaganda”. Pavel Astakhov wrote on his Instagram account: “The family is the safest place! Far more crimes happen in public places, on transport and in stores ... Constant and excessive use of the term ‘domestic violence’ serves to intimidate families and parents.” He advised the government against Russia signing a Council of Europe convention on preventing domestic abuse, arguing that it would be against Russia’s “national interests”.</p> \n<p>Currently, the only cases that get serious consideration from the police and the courts are those where the woman has suffered serious physical injuries or been killed. The onus is on women to file a case, but most lack the necessary legal expertise, let alone money for a lawyer. The system is so complicated that 90% of filed cases are dismissed for technical reasons, and only around 3% result in criminal convictions of any kind. Because a fine of 50,000 roubles (about &pound;630) is the most likely outcome, police are reluctant to accept the bureaucratic work involved in processing a case, said Nikolai Levshits, who works with the charity Russia Behind Bars.</p> \n<p>The UN’s special rapporteur on violence against women <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;ved=0CCYQFjAB&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww2.ohchr.org%2Fenglish%2Fbodies%2Fcedaw%2Fdocs%2Fngos%2FANNANCPV_RussianFederation46.pdf&amp;ei=TXtZVYDmM9SM7AaggoHACw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGTv26Z_wPsmfXY5rN9TlOAmrJL_g&amp;sig2=revfbYMZdC0V9K2bgl9Nhg&amp;bvm=bv.93564037,d.d24\">concluded in a recent report</a>: “The lack of a specific law on domestic violence in Russia is a major obstacle to combating this violence.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/jun/09/patriotism-propaganda-parmesan-what-do-muscovites-really-think\">Patriotism, propaganda and parmesan: what do Muscovites really think?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The emerging campaigns for improvement reveal the strength of the internet in empowering previously voiceless groups of people. Alyona Popova, an activist on this issue, whose <a href=\"http://change.org\">change.org</a> petition calling for legislation <a href=\"http://www.protectwomen.ru/\">gathered 120,000 signatures</a> within days of being launched, explains that she became involved after a friend’s boyfriend beat her violently. “After 24 hours, he visited her in hospital carrying a huge bunch of flowers and she responded by telling me: ‘He is perfect; he is my future. Perhaps this was all my fault.’ This is a powerful women, an entrepreneur who runs her own business, and her response was not unusual,” she said. “Most women don’t go to court. They feel shame; they blame themselves.”</p> \n<p>She is concerned about the number of women in prison for murder, committed in self-defence. “They get no protection from the police, so in the end they take a vase and hit him on the head,” she said. This is an area little-studied in Russia. “No one has any interest in collecting these figures.”</p> \n<p>Campaigning is beginning to break a taboo. When allegations emerged that<strong> </strong>the popular actor Marat Basharov had beaten his actress wife Katya Arkharova so violently last October that she was in a coma, the subject was widely debated on television. “When famous women start talking about it then things begin to change,” Popova said, but she is not certain that new legislation will pass. “Most of the deputies are men, and there’s a perception that these are family matters that should be dealt with in the family. I’m not that optimistic.”<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Activist Alyona Popova is concerned about the number of women in prison for murder, committed in self-defence</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In 2013, there were 43 shelters across Russia with beds for around 400 women – which represents just 3% of the total number of shelter spaces for women victims of violence recommended by the Council of Europe. But the Moscow government last year built a 35-bedroom, well-equipped complex for battered women, with facilities for therapy and psychological support for children – another clear sign that attitudes are changing. </p> \n<p>Natalia Zavialova, head of the state-run centre, said of the 200 women who had stayed in the shelter over the year since it opened, only one had taken her case to court; the rest were unwilling to confront their former partners, or were simply overwhelmed by the difficulties of the legal process. But she senses the start of a shift in the seriousness with which the subject is treated. “People are beginning to talk about the subject more openly and have begun to understand that places like this are essential.”</p> \n<p>Zhavnerovich said she wrote the article to help other women understand what they need to do if they are beaten by boyfriends or husbands. Written in the form of short diary extracts, the piece is her cool account of what happened to her, beginning with the night before New Year, when she and her boyfriend decided to split up after three years together. They agreed, calmly, that this was for the best, and went to sleep. At around 4am she awoke to find him screaming at her, and hitting her head with his fists. She regained consciousness, aware that blood was streaming from her face. It took her a while to decide what to do; when her boyfriend left the flat to go to the local pharmacy to buy antiseptic cream, she called a friend to come and rescue her. </p> \n<p>Initially she didn’t want to approach the police, convinced it would be a useless exercise. Her friends offered, quite seriously, to go and take revenge with a baseball bat, also certain that there was little likelihood of a constructive response from an appeal to the police. After a week, still reluctant to leave her friend’s flat because her injuries were so horrific, she decided to at least try to register a formal complaint. She shows pictures on her iPhone of her face then, unrecognisable because of the injuries. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/jun/10/women-in-moscow-hairstyles-male-cosmonoauts-sexism\">Aren't you interested in the hairstyles of male cosmonauts, too? What it is to be a woman in Moscow</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After her article was published, several lawyers offered their help, but even with discounts (offered in the hope that she would be writing about their services), she estimated that the bills would run up to about $10,000, equivalent to more than six months’ salary. “I’m in a well-paid job, but there’s no way I could afford that,” she said. “Besides that the whole process is so incredibly complicated, you would have spend all your time on preparing the case, collecting the documents, proving you were a victim, acting as a private detective and a lawyer … most women just don’t have the time or the skills.”</p> \n<p>She was lucky in that eventually a lawyer agreed to take on her case pro-bono, and she thinks there will be a hearing within the next two months. She hopes that her ex-partner will get some kind of community-service sentence. “I’m not bloodthirsty, hoping for revenge, but I do want the case to go to court. At the moment, I am the one made to feel guilty.”</p> \n<p>She has received such toxic abuse from online commentators that she no longer reads them, but there has also been support; and within days of publication the article became the most read article in the website’s history. “Women have been emancipated since the Soviet Union, but they have never been feminists; that movement is beginning now,” she said. Zhavernovich is happy to have helped drag the subject out of the shadows. “This was such an unmentionable subject. It was always there but no one ever talked about it. I felt I had a responsibility to tell people about what happened to me.”</p>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433422156834/1b4c0697-87fd-4919-bf42-918eb2fb56ae-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Maria Pleshkova/Demotix","altText":"Anna Zhavnerovich at the W-O-S magazine offices in Moscow","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Maria Pleshkova/Demotix"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/5/1433518472967/8451a3ad-f18f-42c0-95ca-b3f17cfa6c6b-2060x1790.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1790,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Russia’s children’s rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov, wrote: ‘Excessive use of the term “domestic violence” serves to intimidate families and parents’ Photograph: Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images","credit":"Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images","altText":"Russia’s children’s rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov, wrote: “excessive use of the term ‘domestic violence’ serves to intimidate families and parents”","cleanCaption":"Russia’s children’s rights commissioner Pavel Astakhov, wrote: ‘Excessive use of the term “domestic violence” serves to intimidate families and parents’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sasha Mordovets/Getty Images"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T06:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T23:01:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":338,"contributors":[{"name":"Amelia Gentleman","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733291/AmeliaGentleman.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ameliagentleman"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Cities","Domestic violence","Society","Women","Life and style","Russia","Europe","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"cities/cities","webTitle":"Cities"},{"id":"society/domestic-violence","webTitle":"Domestic violence"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"cities"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Amelia Gentleman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ameliagentleman"}}],"series":{"title":"Guardian Moscow week","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/cities/series/guardian-moscow-week"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"cities"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/jun/10/moscow-domestic-violence-problem-russia","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49bdm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/cities/2015/jun/10/moscow-domestic-violence-problem-russia","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jun/10/moscow-domestic-violence-problem-russia"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433422156834/1b4c0697-87fd-4919-bf42-918eb2fb56ae-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘People were surprised it was happening in young, fashionable circles’ ...

Joining Serova as a pioneer is Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Central Bank of Russia and the first woman to hold such a post in a G8 country. Eighteen of the 45 deputies in the Moscow city duma are women, including the new head of the economic policy and finance committee, a portfolio traditionally given to a man (40% might not be perfect but it’s better than the state duma at 14%). <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6c359df0fd2f22fc4f248b520afd2721a5a3f4cc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433846098884/d1893807-6335-4487-aca1-031143f92396-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Elvira Nabiullina, governor of Russia's central bank.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elvira Nabiullina, governor of Russia’s central bank.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There is a wealth of new services by and for Muscovite women, from new incubators for female entrepreneurs to startups such as Sokol Mama, which connects mothers with nannies. In the arts, in business, in film, in technology and many other areas besides, there’s a rich vein of female talent responsible for some of the city’s most exciting projects. Indeed it can sometimes seem, for much of Moscow’s young, educated, liberal set, that many of Russia’s normal rules and cultural attitudes – including sex discrimination – don’t apply.</p> \n<p>Things are far from clear-cut, however. Although 40% of the Moscow city duma are female, only 10 out of 65 positions in the Moscow city government are held by women – and even then they often change their attitude upon election. “Female politicians always enter parliament as feminists and as representatives of women’s rights, but – because they need to pursue their political career – they become outrageous saviours of traditional values,” says Ekaterina Dementieva, editor-in-chief of Afisha, a popular online culture and entertainment portal. The result is a pro-family, pro-life stance that has become politically taboo to challenge. “It stigmatises the reality, in which there are so many women alone and women left with kids.” (Male mortality rates in Russia are high, especially among working-age males, and in 2012 <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsD/demographic/products/dyb/dybsets/2013.pdf\">Russia had the highest divorce rate in the world</a>.)<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The government has really been ramping up the propaganda of traditional gender roles, especially on giving birth</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Maria Dudko</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The protection of traditional values and push towards greater social conservatism is one of the cornerstones of Vladimir Putin’s presidency. It allows him to not only unite Russians with a coherent ideology but to also reposition Russia as a global power in opposition to the liberal and morally lax west. As well as the widely publicised law banning “gay propaganda”, there is a new attack on abortion: in 2013, Russia banned abortion advertising, and parliamentary debate is now focused on removing abortion from health insurance coverage. “The government has been really ramping up the propaganda in terms of traditional gender roles, especially on giving birth,” says Maria Dudko, co-organiser of a gender studies summer school in Moscow. “They’re campaigning for women to have not just one but two or three babies. This is a stupid solution to the demographic problem.”</p> \n<p>Discussion in the Moscow media and on social networks has started at last to put women’s issues such as abortion and domestic violence – and, more controversially, feminism – into the spotlight. “Feminism as a word will still be associated with Pussy Riot jumping around in a church, which means that the pro-government media can say that it’s something evil,” says Dudko. “The positive effect is that the small liberal part of Moscow society has been more willing to discuss what feminism is about.”</p> \n<p>Hence the success of Wonderzine, a women’s magazine that pitches itself as an intelligent alternative to the glossies. Since launching in 2013 with a core audience in Moscow, it has covered topics from feminism to body image and “female misogyny”, the impulse to distance oneself from women in order to succeed in a man’s world. “Every heroine we talk to, whether a cosmonaut or a trainer in a women’s football team in Moscow, is very eager to speak about the discrimination she has met on her way,” says Olga Strakhovskaya. Yet by her own admission, Strakhovskaya and her circle are insulated from traditional, patriarchal Russia. “We’re a whole new generation. When I look at my friends I see people who are in their 30s, who don’t have children and who aren’t married,” she says. “We live with our long-term boyfriends or we live alone. We have allowed ourselves not to fit in. We want to live our lives as we want, so we never grow up.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1878723a9f47e633a6bb2bdfb8cf344ecddba99\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433845856118/2130a1cb-bcb8-4829-be22-67a734926b37-460x309.jpeg\" alt=\"Varvara Melnikova from the Strelka institute\" width=\"460\" height=\"309\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Varvara Melnikova, CEO of the Strelka Institute</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This paradox – a world of highly successful women in a seemingly sexist society – is typified by Varvara Melnikova, who at the age of 30 was appointed director of the Strelka Institute for media, architecture and design.

Despite this, she points to a gender imbalance across Strelka’s different branches: while the cultural institute and the restaurant and bar employ a roughly equal number of men and women, men dominate the academic and consultancy arms.</p> \n<p>“In Moscow quite a lot of business is done in an informal way,” she says. “Lots of deals and important conversations can be done at restaurants or bars, in saunas and nightclubs. Perhaps not deals but important conversations. Sometimes to keep up with these conversations, you need to be a man.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Companies don’t want to hire people with small children: if the children get ill, she has to take time off work</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Aliona Vladimirskya</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Research into gender equality in the workplace reveals a mixed picture. <a href=\"http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_324678.pdf\">A 2014 report from the International Labour Organisation</a> found a marked gender pay gap, but noted that if wage discrimination due to factors such as “having children” was eliminated, women would receive higher salaries than men. </p> \n<p>“If a woman is competent and clever she will get the job,” says Aliona Vladimirskya, who runs the Pruffi headhunting agency for media and IT. She believes the salary gap between men and women is down to men being better at self-promotion. In her opinion, problems for women arise when they decide to have children. “They choose family and don’t give enough time for their careers, and so they lose,” she says. “Whether a woman is 22 or in her 30s, if she has a small child, she’s risky. Companies don’t want to hire people with small children: if the children get ill, for example, she has to take time off work.” </p> \n<p>More recently, <a href=\"http://www.grantthornton.global/globalassets/insights/ibr/ibr2015_wib_report_final.pdf\">professional services firm Grant Thornton</a> declared Russia a world leader in workplace gender equality, with 40% of senior business roles held by women – the highest in the world. Why? High male mortality rates, yes, but also the legacy of equal opportunity during the Soviet Union. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b90cc7d4c1e7b858dc2d5df06670f90558239538\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433846144779/ed79d2a0-048e-4438-8011-a704fa853170-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Yelena Baturina.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Russian billionaire Yelena Baturina.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergey Berezin/RIA Novosti</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Although the USSR’s official line on gender parity did not always play out in practice, women enjoyed state-backed childcare, abortion rights and easy access to divorce. The Soviets launched the first woman into space, allowed women to fly on combat missions in the second world war and reserved one-third of the seats of the Congress of People’s Deputies for women. Again, however, the picture is far from rosy: by 1981, officials had also compiled a list of 460 occupations – such as chimney sweep and metro driver – that women were forbidden from holding because they were deemed detrimental to their health. The list still exists today.</p> \n<p>Is life in Moscow for women changing for better or for worse? One of the capital’s most pernicious problems is everyday sexism, ranging from the occasional catcall to the expectation that women should do all of the housework and take care of the children even if they work.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/129772660\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/129772660\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Is Moscow changing for better or worse? \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That’s not all, says Irina Kostorina, coordinator of the gender democracy programme at the Heinrich B&ouml;ll foundation: women are also under immense pressure to make sure they look attractive at all times. Kostorina points to Yelena Baturina, Russia’s only female billionaire, as an example of somebody whose looks are considered more important than her success. “People said, ‘OK, she’s very successful and rich, but she’s ugly,’” says Kostorina. “In Russia it’s very important not only to be successful but also feminine. You have to be everything.”</p> \n<p>Yet there are some women who refuse to capitulate. Alena Popova, an outspoken advocate for women’s rights, is atypical of many Muscovite women: at the age of 32, she is unmarried, has five adopted children and works in IT as an e-government specialist.</p> \n<p>“When I wanted to adopt, the first question was: do you have a husband?” she says. “Well, I have a boyfriend, and I have my own flat, and my own car, and my own salary, so there are a lot of plusses. But on the other side there’s a huge minus, because I don’t have a husband.” This egregious lack of husband proved most problematic when Popova ran for office in the 2011 parliamentary election. “Being a woman was a huge minus, and not having a husband was another one,” she says. She lost.</p> \n<p>At Tochka Otscheta cafe in Sokol, a neighbourhood in north Moscow, Popova has gathered a group of seven women to share their personal stories about life in the city. Those in the group with children agree that juggling motherhood and a career is one of the biggest challenges in Moscow today, with expensive childcare being among the most pressing issues. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/jun/10/moscow-domestic-violence-problem-russia\">Breaking the taboo: the Moscow women taking a stand against domestic violence</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>According to Popova, who is also a co-founder of Startup Women, an incubator for female entrepreneurship, this has led to a rise in the number of women breaking away from large firms to launch their own small businesses – skirting the saunas completely, as it were – and working for themselves. Alla Kommisarova says she left her job in finance to set up La Princesse Choco, a chocolate shop, after she realised her former career did not offer her the flexibility she needed as a mother of two. Another member of the group, Victoria Pashkova, opened her own family law firm at 26 after facing discrimination in job interviews. “They just looked at me and said, ‘Well, you’ll be pregnant in two years so it’s not a good investment for us’,” she says. </p> \n<p>If there’s one thing both of those women share with the women of Moscow, it’s a greater self-confidence. “I have seen many changes during the last five years,” says Popova. “Before, when I asked women what they would like to do, the response would be: ‘Me? I don’t know. Maybe I can ask an expert. Can you give me an expert that’s a man? But now we have a new way of thinking in the capital: if a woman is strong, first it’s normal, and second it’s good – because she sets a good example and sends the message: yes I can.”</p>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433159311483/32a47b90-e56d-4a85-8f16-30ed18a5dcb8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Russia's cosmonaut Yelena Serova.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Vasily Maximov/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433846099265/d1893807-6335-4487-aca1-031143f92396-2060x1374.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1374,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Elvira Nabiullina, governor of Russia’s central bank.

Conversation can often turn to the merits of gorgonzola, camembert and parmesan, and the defects of their disappointing Russian equivalents.<br /></p> \n<p> The shadow of the conflict in Ukraine still lingers over Moscow, making life harder for its residents in many ways – some of them momentous, including unemployment and acute financial problems; others no more than minor irritations. But everyone here agrees life has changed – both in a practical sense and in terms of people’s moods.</p> \n<p> Surgeon Dmitry Ravilevich, 31, gives me a tour of the local supermarket in his home town of Noginsk, on the outskirts of eastern Moscow. Three fridge units that used to stock European cheeses and yoghurts are now full of 17 Russian varieties – there’s no shortage here. “We used to have Polish apples, now we have apples from Asia. You can’t taste any difference,” he says.</p> \n<p> Back in their one-bedroom flat in the <a href=\"http://www.themoscowtimes.com/article/501790.html\"><em>krushchevka</em></a><em> </em>opposite – the identical five-storey apartment blocks built all over Russia in the 1960s (five storeys was the maximum allowed before the expense of installing an elevator was required) – Dmitry and his wife Elena open their fridge to try to analyse how sanctions are affecting them. Elena, 26, is an engineer currently on maternity leave with their <br />seven-month-old son, Georgy. The fridge is full of Russian sausages, jars of homemade pickled cabbage, black forest gateau from Russia, a jar of locally made Nestle babyfood, and local eggs and bread; they find it hard to point to anything that has disappeared from their lives.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Stop anyone in the street and they'll be able to tell you what a barrel of oil costs today</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Dmitry Ravilevich, surgeon</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> “We felt the effect for the first couple of months – now we don’t feel it any more,” Dmitry says. “Those products which disappeared from the market weren’t really things that we bought – we couldn’t ever afford to buy foreign cheeses so we bought Russian cheese anyway. Things like Norwegian fish disappeared – but it’s not a massive problem for us to stop buying that. We probably wouldn’t have noticed it at all if it hadn’t been talked about so much on television. Richer people who were used to buying those kind of things might have noticed, but we didn’t feel it.”</p> \n<p> Dmitry has a good job in a Moscow hospital but rents in the city are unaffordable, so at 5.30 every morning he leaves home to make a two-hour commute along the traffic-clogged Enthusiasts’ Highway – at one point passing a heart-sinking motorway sign that announces it is 29 months and 15 days until the end of the current roadworks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"066f5b2b2c0afc32704e0973c480c1e4b79c2643\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433754591189/9bada73b-efcf-499e-889a-c83bdab5d712-460x312.jpeg\" alt=\"Tajik migrant workers at a vegetable market on the outskirts of Moscow.\" width=\"460\" height=\"312\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tajik migrant workers at a market on the outskirts of Moscow.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Denis Sinyakov/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> In the evening he returns home again, past the ripped-up earth of construction zones and dozens of skeleton high-rise blocks that stretch up 20 and 30 storeys, their mammoth advertising hoardings giving details of how to buy flats here long before the apartments are anywhere near completion. Dmitry is phlegmatic about the journey, and about life in Moscow.</p> \n<p> “It hasn’t changed much, except maybe we talk more about the economy. Stop anyone in the street and they’ll be able to tell you how much a barrel of oil costs today, and what the rouble-dollar exchange rate is,” he says, turning on his computer in the corner of the sitting room – which doubles as his office and as a bedroom for the baby and their three-year-old son, Alexander. “Look: every website has a panel updating readers on both indexes. Everyone is very conscious of it – but for the moment we’re interested, not worried.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/jun/08/is-the-moscow-experiment-over-gorky-park-sergei-kapkov-alexei-navalny\">Is the 'Moscow experiment' over?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> The family has felt the collapse of the rouble, but the consequences can hardly be described as catastrophic. “We won’t take the children to Greece this summer, we’ll go to Egypt instead,” Dmitry says. “Our friends are going to Crimea, which is ours now, or Egypt or Turkey. It makes no real difference to us. We plan to go to Crimea when the hotels there get a bit better.” Their friends have also decided not to buy European cars, choosing Korean or Japanese models instead; they fear the European car manufacturers will leave Russia and it will be impossible to get replacement parts.</p> \n<p> The collapse of the rouble has prompted tighter spending controls at the hospital where Dmitry works. “We have rationalised our attitude to equipment over the past year; we are using our resources more carefully. Where we might have done two tests previously – an extra one to double-check – now we will only do one. But in terms of quality of the medicines and the equipment we use, it has had no effect. Most of our medicines come from Russia or from India.” </p> \n<p> Both Dmitry and Elena feel broadly supportive of what happened in Ukraine. “We had a moment of uncertainty; we wondered, ‘do we need this Crimea?’ But, like the majority of our friends, we thought it was good for Russia. We don’t talk about it so much any more though.” Dmitry says he has noticed attitudes towards to the west changing in the past year. “We have become more patriotic as a country. People have become more negative in the way they view the west.”</p> \n<h2>‘Any Putin-related story is what they call a priority story’</h2> \n<p> Up until March 2014, Liza Lerer worked for Rossiya, the second-most-watched channel on Russian television. She was in charge of the promotional department, making clips that were broadcast between shows, advertising what was coming up later on the channel. She began to realise several years ago that there was growing pressure on her to make sure the tone of these apparently-innocuous 30-second clips reflected government thinking. </p> \n<p> “You can cut these clips in a neutral way, to promote a documentary or a news programme coming later in the day – or they can become an advertisement for the state. Gradually they became tiny bits of propaganda,” Liza tells me. And so she resigned from her job, no longer willing to turn the trailers advertising news programmes and documentaries into pro-government publicity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a117c920c175788ab496de6a3c8363a7534b3ba9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433438360121/ef83e970-ed7d-4d3a-9eb8-3a3b17ce294b-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Liza Lerer outside her apartment in Moscow, Russia.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liza Lerer outside her apartment in Moscow.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Spasova/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Life for her has changed immeasurably in the past year. As a result of the moral stand she took, Liza has had to move out of the large, expensive flat she and her husband were renting, back to the small one-roomed flat where she grew up. She has been unable to find new work elsewhere, and worries about how she<strong> </strong>will pay for her college-aged children’s education or repay the loans taken out, in more prosperous times, for travel to Europe. </p> \n<p> She is speaking in the tiny kitchen of her flat on the top floor of another <em>krushchevka</em>. Through the open window comes the happy sound of children playing in a playground that was installed by the Moscow government sometime in the last decade – before the economy turned for the worse.</p> \n<p> Liza says she first became uncomfortable with her work in 2011, when she had to make promotional clips for an eight-part documentary on Vladimir Putin, which she describes as “beautifully filmed” but “extremely boring” – with episodes focused on “Putin and Russia’s youth”, “Putin and agriculture”, and so on. Russia’s then-prime minister looked tanned and healthy in every episode, she says. </p> \n<p> “I asked why we had to do so many clips for such a tedious series that no one was going to watch” – but it was a rhetorical question. It was already clear to Liza that for the channel, “any Putin-related story is what they call a priority story. No matter how well or badly made the documentary was, the trailers themselves would be shown repeatedly and seen by a huge audience; in theory the trailers were promoting a series on Putin, but in fact they were actually promoting Putin himself.”</p> \n<p> It would be easy to underestimate the significance of these short clips, squeezed in between the Russian equivalents of Dancing on Ice and Dancing with the Stars and advertisements, but Liza explains they are a significant part of the state broadcasting machine: “Tens of millions watch the channel every night. That’s why I was so worried about my role in the process.”</p> \n<p> When tens of thousands gathered in Moscow in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2012/may/06/vladimir-putin-presidency-violent-protests-moscow\">May 2012 to protest against contested election results</a> and Putin’s return to the presidency, the nature of the news programmes put out by the Rossiya channel became much more pro-government. Liza, 43, who had attended these demonstrations herself, says she found it very difficult. She found herself undermining the behaviour and motives of the protesters and the protest leaders with suspicious-sounding questions: “The promotional clips we made told viewers the programme would be asking: ‘Who are these protesters? What do they want? Are their goals the same as their leaders? What are these people gathering for?’”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Tens of millions watch the channel every night. That’s why I was so worried about my role</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Liza Lerer, former Rossiya journalist</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> Liza discussed her unease with a few of her colleagues. She says a small proportion of them agreed with her but were afraid to lose their jobs by taking an ethical decision and resigning. A small group were ardent supporters of Putin. “The majority, though, just don’t care. There is a sense of apathy, a sense that we have the leader we deserve. People say: ‘Well is it any better in the west? They have corruption there too.’ People are so used to conforming – we grew up in the Soviet era. Very few people resigned for political reasons. I thought there would be more – but even those who do feel uneasy, they have comfortable lives; it’s hard to give that up.” </p> \n<p> A couple of months into the Ukrainian crisis, there was renewed pressure to toe the party line. “We were told that the trailers should be more aggressive. We had to make a montage of the Ukrainian leaders, of Ukrainian protesters fighting, to show them in a bad light; to show that if they come to power, things will be very bad,” she recalls. “I began to feel that what I was doing was intolerable and positively dangerous for the country; I felt ashamed. I knew it was only going to get worse, and that the pressure to propagandise for the government would increase.” </p> \n<p> Liza resigned. “I had no choice. I couldn’t stay. My immediate boss knew why I left, but it wasn’t widely known. The head of the channel wouldn’t really have cared about the departure of an editor-in-chief of the promotions department.”</p> \n<p> While she doesn’t regret her decision, it has come at a huge cost to her family. Things over the past year have not been easy because her departure coincided with the economic crisis. She remains unemployed. She couldn’t go to another state channel, broadcasting news and politics, because she would have been confronted with the same problem. Elsewhere in the media sector, few people are hiring.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/08/moscow-quiz-russia-test\">How much do you know about Moscow? – quiz</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Sitting in her warm apartment, the walls lined with books and CDs, a grand piano squeezed into the main room, beautiful antique typewriters on display, she shrugs off her financial problems as “unimportant”. Because she was brought up in the Soviet Union and lived through the economic difficulties of the 1990s, she is familiar with the sensation of being short of money.</p> \n<p> “But in the 1990s we were young and happy to be poor. We felt were were living through an interesting time, the country was changing for the better. We got used to freedom, to writing openly, to talking openly. It is frightening how far things have gone back in another direction,” she says. “Now we’re in this dead-end and it is hard to see how things will change for the better. It is a horrible period. For the first time in my life, I don’t see a future.”</p> \n<p> Her husband Alexander Stoliarchuk, an arts journalist, has also noticed a stark change in the past year. “It is like living in a foreign country,” he says, coming in from the flat’s other room, to stroke their elderly black cat and make black tea. “Over the last year I have heard some people who I considered friends, people who I always thought were ‘on my side’, say things like: ‘It’s time we taught a lesson to America’; ‘We need another Stalin’; ‘It’s so good to see Russia defend her values at last.’”</p> \n<p> Alexander feels Moscow has become more xenophobic and hostile to the west. It is a difficult time for both of them.</p> \n<h2> Beneath the European veneer</h2> \n<p> On the surface at least, Moscow seems as prosperous as ever. If you walk around the centre of the city, it is impossible not to be struck by the proliferation of new bars and restaurants, with tables on the streets; when the sun is out it feels positively Parisian. As well as Starbucks and Burger King, there are dog salons and 24-hour-sushi restaurants, karaoke nightclubs and artisanal breadshops, selling hand-made macaroons in pastel colours. On the metro, commuters travel with their necks bent at the same angle you can observe on any European metro, staring into tablets and iPhones (Moscow has Wi-Fi underground), playing Candy Crush as they make their way along the platform. </p> \n<p> Beneath the European veneer, there are traces of a new, more ostentatious nationalism – visible in the orange-and-black St George’s ribbons that celebrate victory in the war but have become a symbol of the pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine, which can be seen tied to car aerials and pinned to school children travelling home on the metro.</p> \n<p> In the loos in the recently opened Sanctions Bar, customers get to use toilet paper decorated with $100 bills or images of Barack Obama’s head. The walls are covered with cartoons that underline the fundamental stupidity of the US president and Putin’s relative wisdom. Bills are presented inside matryoshka wooden dolls decorated with Putin’s face, the place is lit by a chandelier made of bank notes (dollars and euros at the bottom, roubles at the top) and the menu prides itself on using only Russian ingredients. Evgeny Belkin, the restaurant’s art director, who helped to come up with the theme, explains that the idea was partly a joke, but that some customers come because they want to show their annoyance at the western imposition of sanctions.</p> \n<p> For most this new patriotism is welcome, but one woman, who is not a Putin supporter, tells me she is devoting a lot of time to the lengthy process of applying for Israeli citizenship, because she is anxious that her young daughter will come under pressure to conform to this new spirit of nationalism at school. “I grew up during an era when you could say one thing at home, but needed to be careful to say something else at school. Why would I want to put her through that?”</p> \n<h2>‘We swapped our values for Snickers and Coca-Cola’</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"93b43706e9859645d983a21e2bc4f425d8420ff6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432898090804/0c223225-91a0-4d18-b487-98ad73fd3105-460x316.jpeg\" alt=\"Model and former Mrs Globe and Mrs Russia, Alisa Krylova.\" width=\"460\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘I haven’t felt any panic’ ...

She didn’t need to worry about the blockade on western cheeses, she said, because she stocked up on her favourites during regular trips to Paris.</p> \n<p> Conscious of the danger of sounding obnoxious and out of touch with the rest of Russia, she is more considered when we meet in her spacious flat in a new glass apartment complex, located above the orchid-festooned <a href=\"http://www.mario.su/\">Italian restaurant Mario</a> (which is listed, with relish, in guidebooks as one of Moscow’s five most expensive places to eat). To reach her apartment, you have to pass through two layers of security: a videophone, operated by security guards behind the thick metal gate that separates the block from the street, and beyond it, a second security guard in the entrance hall before you can travel up to the flat. A child-sized silver Bentley is parked in the lobby next to a pram, by the lift. </p> \n<p> Krylova has imposed her own kind of austerity measures on family life: holidays have been taken in Russia. “Of course I haven’t travelled with the children for a holiday abroad. Why would I pay several times over the odds just to go abroad? I can’t see the point,” she says. “I’ve become very aware of how much everything costs now and how much I am prepared to pay for everything. I’m conscious of the rouble’s collapse, but I can’t say I’ve been tremendously worried by it. I haven’t felt any panic.”</p> \n<p> She points out that as a result of people from her circle shying away from overpriced European brands, there has been an explosion in the popularity of Russian designers. “Now we are supporting our own designers – that’s a positive result,” she says, while acknowledging that her own neon pink shirt is made by the Parisian label Balmain.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/08/30-under-30-moscows-young-power-list\">30 under 30: Moscow's young power list</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> Krylova’s daughters, five and 11, zoom in and out of the sitting room, leaning over the sofa to whisper to their mother, desperate to pick bits of icing off the enormous and unusual cake she has had made for her husband’s birthday – decorated with a large marzipan model of her, instantly recognisable with flowing blonde hair and cheekbones, perched on the edge of the cake, next to a winged angel. She is polite and hospitable, offering tea in porcelain cups, and a saucer of strawberry jam, made by her grandmother, to eat with a teaspoon. Huge oil paintings of her in sleeveless ball gowns hang on the walls, painted to celebrate her victory at the Mrs Russia awards in 2010 and the <a href=\"http://beautifulrus.com/alisa-krylova-mrs-globe-2011/\">Mrs Globe awards in 2011</a>. </p> \n<p> Krylova, 32, studied economics at university before becoming a model, and her sense of perspective on the crisis allows her to shrug off the mild privations she is currently experiencing. Her family’s eating habits have changed but barely in a way she feels able to complain about. “We ate French fish before and now we eat Tunisian fish … and so what?” She does, though, lament the disappearance of some of her favourite Moscow shops, particularly the jewellery and diamond shop Graf, which recently shut the branch nearest her house: “A lot of shops have closed, because their rents were pegged to the dollar and have become unaffordable.” </p> \n<p> Beyond these minor inconveniences, Krylova is frustrated by the sanctions and counter-sanctions because of the damage they have wrought on economic ties built up by Russia and the west over the past two decades. “All the work we have done over years and years, has been wasted overnight – what’s it all for?”</p> \n<p> Yet she fully supports Putin’s actions both in reclaiming Crimea and in his response to the imposition of western sanctions. The events of the past 18 months have made her feel more patriotic and loyal to the president.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It is good that we have such an intelligent, wise man, a worthy leader at the head of our country</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Alisa Krylova</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> “It is good that we have such an intelligent, wise man, a worthy leader at the head of our country. As a Russian citizen, I’m very proud that finally we have a leader capable of governing this huge country,” she says. “Perhaps his methods appear rather harsh to some people, but people who understand a bit about politics and the economy and history, will understand that his actions are quite well thought through and are exactly what we need at the moment. Vladimir Vladimirovich has done so much positive for our country.” </p> \n<p> She welcomes the new emphasis Putin has put on promoting patriotism in Russia. Her older daughter spent a month at school preparing for the 70th anniversary of the end of the second world war, and the triumph over fascism – learning poems, writing essays and preparing a show for parents. “We lived through an era when all our most important values were swapped for Snickers and Coca-Cola. This new focus on the preservation of our history is very important.”</p> \n<p> Krylova says she knows people on the list of named individuals who have been banned from travelling and subject to asset freezes. She admits it had been a very difficult period for them, and for anyone trying to do business in Russia – she herself has seen a 30% drop in the modelling work offered over the past year because of the crisis, but is trying to see a positive in this too. She plans to branch out from modelling by setting up a personal training centre: “I’m going to teach people how to be a supermodel, how to be a successful woman, mother and wife.”</p> \n<h2> ‘The country has become more xenophobic since Crimea’</h2> \n<p> Evgeny, 68, a retired translator and Elena, 67, a retired bio-chemist agree readily to be interviewed in their central Moscow flat about how their lives have changed in the wake of the Ukraine crisis, the recession and sanctions, but they quickly decided they do not want their full names to be published and that they would rather not be photographed. Evgeny’s explanation of why he prefers to remain anonymous reveals how swiftly attitudes are changing in Moscow.</p> \n<p> “Maybe five years ago, I wouldn’t have minded naming myself, but people have become more xenophobic since the hysteria around Crimea. The country has become a more isolated place; people are very sceptical of foreigners. We are old enough to have experienced many of the pleasures of the Soviet era – when there was punishment for contact with foreigners, suspicion and displeasure,” he said.</p> \n<p> He remembers being telephoned from America by a US journalist friend in the 1980s. “I was contacted by the KGB. I had to go in for a meeting to be asked: why do you know her, how did you meet her, who introduced you? That suspicion is returning – not to the same extent, but I feel it. I think there are people who monitor the western press, who are watching what people say. I don’t know how diligently, but they do monitor it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I definitely wouldn’t speak about Putin in public</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Evgeny, retired translator</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p> Both Evgeny and Elena opposed the annexation of Crimea, and have stopped talking to some former friends who they feel have become excessively nationalistic in their response to the situation in Ukraine.</p> \n<p> “There has been a very sharp division of people in terms of their attitude to the Crimea. For a while, people were talking about it all the time and we began to mix with fewer people as a result. Mostly I restrain myself from talking about it. I never initiate this kind of conversation. I try to be as neutral as possible. But some of those who hold more xenophobic views are prone to be a bit more aggressive. There are a couple of friends I know not to speak to about this, and there’s another couple I haven’t seen for almost year – because their views are so different, I don’t want to hear them. In any case, we talk about it less now than a year ago. It has started being part of our life.”</p> \n<p> Both of them say they are much more cautious about how they talk about politics now, and would be careful not to express hostility towards Putin in public. “I definitely wouldn’t speak about Putin in public. I wouldn’t want to provoke any confrontation. When you lived in the Soviet Union, you would tread very carefully; you would always be looking for signs that this was a person you could share opinions with – it was a subtle thing; you’d know from a couple of words, or a couple of grimaces. But if someone else brought the subject up, you would hold your tongue. It’s not dangerous like that now, it’s just that it has the potential to be very unpleasant.”</p> \n<p> Evgeny recoils at the heightened patriotism on display in Moscow: “A patriot now is not someone who loves their country. It means you support the government, you support xenophobia, that you are opposed to the west, opposed to liberal thinking. It has taken on a very particular new meaning.” But he finds it hard to envisage a post-Putin era: “I’m afraid I can’t even imagine it. He has been here 15 years – how can you imagine life without him?”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"421f59bbf98aa4ec3e66dea28ab5bfea68751fd0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/5/1433516639037/43dc2aaf-1f85-4941-9174-2f6da3093125-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Aviapark shopping centre on opening day.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aviapark shopping centre on opening day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Spasova</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> From their sunny balcony, the pair point out how radically the skyline around their apartment has changed in the past decade. Two looming, glass-panelled buildings have arrived, obscuring smaller, older landmarks; they are not enthusiastic about the architecture, but try to focus their attention instead on the carnations they are growing in the window box.

Its launch coincided with the rouble’s collapse, and many of the planned shops are still empty. </p> \n<p> With their combined state pensions coming to around 30,000 roubles a month (&pound;385), Elena and Evgeny, like most Moscow shoppers, have become more cautious in their shopping and have felt the impact of the sanctions and the devalued rouble. Products that they used to buy routinely have become luxuries.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2015/jun/09/tv-rain-russia-only-independent-television-channel\">TV Rain: inside Russia's only independent television channel</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> “I used to buy a bottle of wine a week; now perhaps it’s more like once a month,” Evgeny says. “And, absurd as it sounds, I miss the cheeses. In Soviet Russia there were no specialist cheeses, there was really just one type. It wasn’t even really cheese – something similar to cheese, but not quite cheese – so when you got these cheeses in the 1990s, when people tried them … cheese came to symbolise the range of things you could have in a post-Soviet state. </p> \n<p> “Even poorer people could choose between five and 10 imported varieties and it was quite affordable,” Evgeny adds, laughing about the amount of attention cheese consumption has attracted since sanctions were introduced. “I really love mature cheese, camembert, brie. You can still find them in some shops, but the prices are exorbitant.”</p>","section":"Cities","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433415329446/e30bedec-3d1c-46a0-a290-dd0e9602cc17-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Elena Spasova/Guardian","altText":"Liza Lerer and her husband at her apartment in Moscow","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Elena Spasova/Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433754591572/9bada73b-efcf-499e-889a-c83bdab5d712-2060x1399.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1399,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tajik migrant workers at a market on the outskirts of Moscow.
