The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/11/david-cameron-european-union-referendum\">vote may be as early as 2016</a>. But before the debate on the merits of staying, or going, even begins, another question will need to be answered – and it could have a substantial impact on the result.</p> \n<h2>Who gets to vote?</h2> \n<p>The question over who will be able to cast a ballot in the EU referendum is far more complicated than may initially meet the eye.</p> \n<p>In last week’s UK parliamentary general elections <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/faq/voting-and-registration/who-is-eligible-to-vote-at-a-uk-general-election\">British citizens, and qualifying Commonwealth citizens and citizens of the Republic of Ireland</a> resident in the UK were, if registered, eligible to vote.</p> \n<p>These same criteria were used in the <a href=\"http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/find-information-by-subject/elections-and-referendums/past-elections-and-referendums/referendums\">2011 AV referendum</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/11/david-cameron-european-union-referendum\">David Cameron may bring EU referendum forward to 2016</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, citizens of EU countries residing in the UK can vote in elections for local government and the European parliament . And, <a href=\"http://neweuropeans.net/article/614/fifth-column-will-deliver-yes-vote-referendum\">following the precedent set by the Greater London Authority</a>, EU citizens can also vote in elections for the Scottish parliament, the National Assembly for Wales, and the Northern Ireland Assembly if they are registered in Scotland, Wales, or Northern Ireland respectively.</p> \n<p>And EU nationals were able to cast a ballot in last year’s Scottish independence referendum. This is because the eligibility criteria in that vote was grounded on residency, and not on citizenship alone, which meant that <a href=\"https://www.scotreferendum.com/questions/who-can-vote-in-the-referendum/\">EU nationals living in Scotland could have a say</a>, while Scots not residing in Scotland couldn’t. Also, the minimum age for voting in that referendum was lowered to 16 instead of 18, which is the normal voting arrangement in UK elections.</p> \n<p>Although of course not a UK election, Ireland held two referendums to ratify the Treaty of Nice. Unlike in the country’s parliamentary elections, where British citizens residing in the Republic can vote, <a href=\"http://www.vote.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=119&amp;Itemid=100051\">only Irish citizens could cast ballots those votes and are eligible to vote in constitutional referendums</a>.</p> \n<p>Overall there is no “right” eligibility criteria. Without a written constitution, it’s all about which precedent and set of principles – citizenship, nationality or residence – the government will choose to pursue. Arguments in favour, or against, all of these approaches is valid, and equally balanced with pros and cons.</p> \n<p>However, a look at the numbers behind the different options reveals that the difference between theory and practice isn’t as balanced: the choice the government does put forward will have profound implications.</p> \n<h2>Possible scenarios:</h2> \n<p>If the same criteria as in the general British parliamentary election were used then there would be about 46 million eligible voters.</p> \n<p>Of these, about 3.4 million are <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/about-ons/business-transparency/freedom-of-information/what-can-i-request/published-ad-hoc-data/census/ethnicity/ct0240-2011-census.xls\">born in Commonwealth countries, British overseas territories/crown dependencies and Ireland</a> - meaning that if a criteria based on nationality were adopted instead (like Ireland did for its vote on the Nice Treaty, and does for <a href=\"http://www.vote.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=119&amp;Itemid=100051\">constitutional referendums</a>, for example) the number of eligible voters could drop to as low as 42.6 million (the precise number would depend on how many are also British citizens as they would still be able to cast a ballot).</p> \n<p>Wherever that figure falls is probably the lower end of the spectrum among the different possibilities the government will consider.</p> \n<p>The biggest debate between political parties is likely to centre around giving the right to vote to EU nationals that are resident in the UK.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jan/19/-sp-thousands-britons-claim-benefits-eu\">ONS estimates there about 2.7 million such individuals in the UK</a>, compared with <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5cd640f6-9025-11e3-a776-00144feab7de.html\">about 1.8 million Britons that live in Europe</a> (which is more than one in three <a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/number-britons-living-abroad-soars-3860424\">Britons living abroad</a>).</p> \n<p>One argument will be that UK nationals living abroad will have the right to vote because of the passport they hold.</p> \n<p>However, another point of view is that the outcome of the referendum may have an impact on the lives of those 1.8 million people. At the very least it could curtail ease of doing business <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/jan/19/-sp-thousands-britons-claim-benefits-eu\">and access to benefits and services</a>. At the extreme, it could lead to some having to return to Britain.</p> \n<p>It is this second argument that could be made for EU nationals that live and work in Britain. Many will have lived in the UK for a number of years (perhaps even for a longer period of time than in their country of origin). They consider Britain to be their home. They have family here. They pay their taxes here. Yet, they may not have a say in a decision that would have a huge impact on their lives.</p> \n<p>Adding EU nationals to the tally of eligible voters would bring the number of potential voters to 48.7 million. </p> \n<p>If the government were to go further and follow the example of the Scottish independence referendum, by lowering the voting age for the EU referendum to 16, then about 1.5 million more people would be added to the electorate.</p> \n<p>These, and the number of EU nationals, are of course both estimates (based on the most recent <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/pop-estimate/population-estimates-for-uk--england-and-wales--scotland-and-northern-ireland/2013/index.html\">ONS population figures</a>), and not all will be voters, and the government may well opt for partial solutions (eg EU nationals that have been residents in the UK for a minimum number of years) - but what is clear is that in a close race they could both prove to be powerful voting blocs.</p> \n<p>Adding all the possible voting groups to the 2015 general election electorate could bring the total number of eligible voters in the EU referendum to 50.2 million. This makes a difference of up to 7.6 million people between the lower and higher ends of the spectrum of options the from which the government will need to choose. </p> \n<p>Or, put another way, enough votes to change the outcome of a close referendum. </p> \n<p>If you close your eyes, you can already hear Nigel Farage warning against granting a referendum vote to millions of Europeans. Nicola Sturgeon arguing against Westminster imposing its voting system on the people of Scotland. The Lib Dems, all eight of them, calling for all EU nationals and 16-17 year olds to have a say.</p> \n<p>Stuck in the middle is David Cameron. The prime minister has a difficult decision to make even before he starts renegotiating the terms of Britain’s membership of the EU. And the repercussions of whatever the PM does choose may continue well beyond the day of the referendum. It may well decide its result.<br /></p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431518482064/29b8616e-b2fe-4925-a0da-e8a3b910a4bb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"EU and British flags outside the European commission building in Brussels.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Emmanuel Dunand/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T12:10:54Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T12:48:26Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":366,"contributors":[{"name":"Alberto Nardelli","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/15/1413373452737/Alberto-Nardelli-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alberto-nardelli"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["EU referendum","European Union","Europe","Foreign policy","Politics","UK news","World news","David Cameron","Nigel Farage"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/eu-referendum","webTitle":"EU referendum"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"politics/foreignpolicy","webTitle":"Foreign policy"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"politics/davidcameron","webTitle":"David Cameron"},{"id":"politics/nigel-farage","webTitle":"Nigel Farage"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Alberto Nardelli","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/alberto-nardelli"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#005689","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#005689","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#63717a","colourPalette":"analysis"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/13/britain-eu-referendum-who-gets-to-vote-deciding-factor","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48apt","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/2015/may/13/britain-eu-referendum-who-gets-to-vote-deciding-factor","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/13/britain-eu-referendum-who-gets-to-vote-deciding-factor"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431518482064/29b8616e-b2fe-4925-a0da-e8a3b910a4bb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"EU and British flags outside the European commission building in Brussels.

It is related to another kind of deficit: trust. Despite a long and vibrant democratic tradition, the “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_mother_of_parliaments_%28expression%29\" title=\"\">mother of all parliaments</a>” is failing her children.</p> \n<p>Voter turnout at this election, at 66.1%, although trumpeted as the highest since 1997, was only marginally higher than 2010’s 65% and was well behind the 71.4% who voted in Blair’s first victory. A depressing 7.5 million people – almost one in six adults – failed to even register to vote.</p> \n<p>The UK parliament brings together 650 MPs representing, on average, almost 100,000 constituents each. Issues and solutions should therefore be able to rise bottom-up as well as top-down. The truth, however, is that parliament is far from representative. Although the number of women has risen by a third to 191, they still represent less than one in three MPs. While 43% of Labour MPs are now women which may bring a different and more collaborative style to the party, the eight Liberal Democrat MPs are all men. There are only 43 MPs from ethnic minority backgrounds, which is up 50%, but still only 7% of the total. More and more MPs seem to be career politicians with little experience of the working world about which they make decisions.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Most people feel as if they are watching a small body of powerful people make the real decisions behind closed doors</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The major political parties also reduce the ability of MPs to genuinely represent the views of their local constituents because they are made to toe the line on so many issues. No longer is parliament an aggregate of local needs debated at national level.</p> \n<p>Most people in the UK feel most of the time as if they are watching the spectacle of a small body of powerful people or organisations make the real decisions behind closed doors. They have lost the knowledge of how to influence and the habit of trying. They need to redevelop a sense of how their individual actions make a difference.</p> \n<p>Voting once every five years is not the same as democracy. Interactive, responsive government is an aspiration cherished by many, promised by a number of political leaders, including our last three prime ministers, but is definitely not yet a reality.</p> \n<p>In 2010-11, according to the Department for Communities and Local Government’s <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120919132719/http:/www.communities.gov.uk/documents/statistics/pdf/1992885.pdf\" title=\"\">citizenship survey</a>, 74% of people said it was important to be able to influence local decision making. Yet three years later, the Cabinet Office’s community life survey showed that only 41% of people took part in any civic participation in the last year, a statistically significant decrease compared to 2012-13. Only a third of people felt that they could influence decisions affecting their local area, a statistically significant decrease compared to the previous year (38%) and all other years since 2001. So there is a widespread thirst for participation in democracy that isn’t being quenched.</p> \n<p>Many have talked about the lack of real power even at the centre of political life. Rory Stewart, the Conservative MP for Penrith and the Border, has said that being an MP is the <a href=\"http://www.rorystewart.co.uk/secret-modern-britain-power-anywhere/\" title=\"\">most powerless position</a> he has ever held, and wrote memorably: “You get there and you pull the lever, and nothing happens.” This system is not working for anyone: the tiny minority apparently in power or the powerless majority. It’s ittle wonder that so many people think there’s no point in voting. It’s time to tear down the Berlin Wall between politicians and citizens and reconnect. The UK invented modern, parliamentary democracy. We now need to reinvent it.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/09/margate-ukip-greens-electoral-reform-farage\">Five million votes, two seats: smaller parties demand a change in the rules</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The peculiar maths of this election may of course give rise to renewed cries for proportional representation. Just under 1.5 million people voted for the SNP and yet it won 56 seats. But the Green party won only one seat from just over 1.1 million votes.</p> \n<p>The solution lies not in PR but elsewhere. The Tories created the rhetoric of “big society” without delivering on the substance or enabling mechanisms. It sounded very welcome, for example, that a petition with 100,000 signatures could trigger a parliamentary debate. In reality, these debates are usually staged on a Friday when most MPs are in their constituencies.</p> \n<p>Participatory budgeting doesn’t happen nearly enough and when it does it’s often confined to a single area of spending such as childcare. The demands on councils to publish all their spending has often simply resulted in laundry lists that even the most time-rich and determined citizen activist would struggle to build into a coherent picture of priorities.</p> \n<p>In an age where people can interrogate most companies and products online as well as elsewhere, the government still remains largely remote and inscrutable. We need to create new links between individuals and ministers.</p> \n<p>Left and right are not the issue any more, just as Green should no longer be a party but rather a universal strategy. We need to reinvent politics altogether.</p> \n<p>If nothing else, irrefutable maths requires this. We have a maximum of 40 years to <a href=\"http://www.rtcc.org/2014/04/14/ipcc-report-urgent-un-climate-deal-needed-to-meet-co2-targets/\" title=\"\">halve carbon emissions and avoid the most dangerous climate change</a>, the next 10 being the most critical. We need to actively engage NHS staff and the public to be proactively involved in everything from better diets and more exercise to the constant improvement of care through pooling the observations and ideas of frontline clinicians. No politicians invite us to improve the delivery of services in the profession or sector in which we work or give us the tools by which to achieve it. Yet the technology to enable us to all be involved has never been more plentiful.</p> \n<p>This election has lacked a powerful ideology to inspire people, to bind us as citizens into a common purpose. Huge issues have barely been touched on and, tragically, the party that raised two of them – the Liberal Democrats, with their manifesto commitments on mental health and education – were wiped out.</p> \n<p>People are starting to declare very passionately the level at which they feel they can genuinely have a say and need to have an influence. It seems to have strong echoes of what the ancient Greeks felt about democracy in Athens: that once you get beyond 15,000 to 20,000 people – the “polis” or city from which the name “politics” is derived – it’s difficult for people to really feel they have influence.</p> \n<p>We need many more mayors leading cities; much more participatory budgeting by local authorities; a North of England and a Midlands assembly; citizens’ juries and regular votes and informed debates, both digitally and in public meetings, on issues as critical as immigration, food poverty, the housing crisis, care for the elderly and the future of the NHS. That way we can live up to what the Athenians created and held dear: true democracy.</p> \n<p>It is in the mutual self-interest of the state and the citizen to form a new relationship of collaboration. We are all capable and we are all vulnerable. We must work together in that spirit.</p> \n<p><strong>This is an edited extract from Paul Twivy’s book, Be Your Own Politician, published by Biteback Publishing</strong></p>","section":"Society","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/11/1431352267121/Demonstrators-at-an-anti--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Demonstrators protest during an anti-austerity march in London - but what difference will it make in parliament?

Now, as David Mundell, the sole Scottish Conservative MP, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-32694984\" title=\"\">is appointed secretary of state for Scotland</a>, the loneliness of his position is pretty stark. He cuts an isolated figure, mirrored only by his shadow, Ian Murray, who this week spluttered incoherently on the radio about how he was <a href=\"http://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/top-stories/labour-mp-ian-murray-breaks-ranks-over-trident-1-3744485\" title=\"\">personally opposed to Trident</a>. Labour is resolutely attached to it and he remains bound by collective responsibility.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>They will be defending the most vulnerable across the country against the coming wave of cuts</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>There’s neither mandate nor legitimacy for this government in Scotland, where it has only a single MP out of 59. Once again Scotland has voted one way and got the government England elects. When it imposes the replacement of Trident and continues to tighten the austerity screw, this illegitimacy will become clear.</p> \n<p>It’s untenable. But how will the SNP cope with these tensions? What are the hopes and challenges for the new recruits?</p> \n<p>The challenge is first to find meaning as individual backbench MPs, and traction as a bloc. While the focus has been on some of the youngest MPs, many are battle-hardened from the Scottish referendum yes campaign. Among these are <a href=\"http://whitford.scot/\" title=\"\">Philippa Whitford (Ayrshire Central)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/edinburgh-east-s-new-snp-mp-tommy-sheppard-hails-win-1-3768100\" title=\"\">Tommy Sheppard (Edinburgh East)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/people/michelle-thomson\" title=\"\">Michelle Thomson (Edinburgh West)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.snp.org/people/natalie-mcgarry\" title=\"\">Natalie McGarry (Glasgow East)</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/video/2015/may/08/alex-salmond-general-election-gordon-snp-video\" title=\"\">Alexander Salmond (Gordon)</a>.</p> \n<p>But some will still be reeling from the shock. <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=+Roger+Mullin+Fife\" title=\"\">Roger Mullin in Fife</a> overturned Gordon Brown’s huge majority with a massive <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/S14000041\" title=\"\">37.9% swing</a>.</p> \n<p>Collectively, as the third-largest party, they will get a share of positions on key committees. The challenge will be to work effectively without being absorbed and assimilated into the Westminster machine. When to apply oppositional tactics and when to ameliorate and amend will be difficult decisions.</p> \n<p>The main focus of the group as a whole will be to give voice to an alternative narrative to the austerity agenda. As Labour begins its own autopsy and remains in a state of disarray, and with the Liberal Democrats reduced to a rump, the SNP is the de facto opposition of a UK parliament it has opposed and attacked for years.</p> \n<p>It’s a big responsibility – and one undertaken in the face of extraordinary media hostility and scrutiny. As tabloid cartoons speak of haggis and deep-fried Mars bars, the new recruits will be working quietly on behalf of their constituents.

A powerful nationwide alliance of west and east coast, Highland and Lowland, town, city and rural areas has emerged and swung behind the SNP.”</p> \n<p>This high expectation is a very real pressure, and there probably isn’t a consensus on big-ticket issues such as the time and conditions for another referendum.

electoral defeat in its history.</p> \n<p>A group of centre-left MSPs, trade unions including Unite and former MPs who lost their seats in last week’s rout is openly challenging Murphy’s leadership before a Scottish Labour executive meeting on Saturday.</p> \n<p>Scotland’s largest union Unison gave Murphy breathing space after it stepped back from calling for his resignation but it said on Tuesday that it could support calls for him to stand down if “a wider movement proposed change”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a

unprecedented for a party leader not to stand down after such a defeat, particularly when he loses his own seat,” Unison’s Labour affiliation committee said. “The [Scottish Labour] campaign may have been energetic, but it lacked focus and clearly voters do not regard Jim Murphy as a credible messenger of Scottish Labour values.”</p> \n<p>That split in the party will deepen later on Wednesday when some of Murphy’s leading critics meet in Glasgow at a meeting organised by the Campaign for Socialism, which is closely aligned with Murphy’s main challenger for party leader last year, Neil Findlay MSP. </p> \n<p>It is widely expected that Murphy, Scottish Labour’s fifth leader in seven years, will secure the executive’s support this weekend after a majority of Labour MSPs and its sole surviving MP, shadow Scottish secretary Ian Murray, backed his decision to remain in his post. </p> \n<p>But organisers of Wednesday’s anti-Murphy meeting are canvassing support from constituency Labour parties in a bid to push Murphy into voluntarily standing down, and to coax other critics of his leadership at Holyrood into publicly calling for his resignation. </p> \n<p>Stephen Low, a Unison official and an organiser of the Campaign for Socialism meeting, said Murphy’s position was made impossible because last week’s election defeat, where Scottish Labour lost 40 of its 41 seats and lost roughly 400,000 votes, proved that he was a clear electoral liability.</p> \n<p>He said Murphy’s credibility would be open to constant challenge because he no longer had a parliamentary seat. Failing to replace him before next year’s Holyrood parliament elections greatly increased Labour’s chances of another catastrophic defeat to the SNP.</p> \n<p>“It’s not just the fact he has lost his seat; it is not just the fact he was the guy on deck when [the defeat] happened. He was in complete control of the election campaign and the campaign was a shambles,” Low said. </p> \n<p>He said Murphy’s campaign lurched from trying to woo back Labour voters who voted yes to independence, to then attacking the independence cause in an effort to appeal to Tory and Lib Dem tactical voters. “If you talk to anybody who is not in the Labour party, they’re actually bewildered that he’s still in place,” Low added.</p> \n<p>In a series of blows to Murphy this week, Alex Rowley, the MSP and former Fife council leader who was a close ally of Gordon Brown’s, has resigned his frontbench post, with three other MSPs publicly questioning Murphy’s continued role as leader.</p> \n<p>Four MSPs have now openly criticised Murphy’s decision to remain in post. After Unite and the rail union Aslef – both known opponents of Murphy’s original leadership bid – called for him to step down, the GMB engineering union backed him. </p> \n<p>Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, said he supported Murphy’s continuing leadership despite the scale of the party’s defeat last week. Murphy and his deputy Kezia Dugdale had only been in post for five months and needed more time to rescue the party.</p> \n<p>“The outcome was at the top end of our worst nightmares but the general trend had set in some time before the election,” he said. “We need time to reflect and we need time to put together a programme for change. We’re not going to regain the trust of the Scottish people by finding TV cameras [to complain to], by finding very simple answers to incredibly difficult questions.</p> \n<p>“There is no point to us rushing to conclusions. One or two people breaking off to demand his resignation isn’t helpful.”</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3f3d2a798be42ef59b489e2baf545310cb99e03b/0_192_5166_3099/5166.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3099,"width":5166,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Cheskin/PA","altText":"Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy speaks during a press conference in Glasgow, as he said he still believes he can be Scotland's first minister next year, despite leading Scottish Labour to its worst Westminster election result.
