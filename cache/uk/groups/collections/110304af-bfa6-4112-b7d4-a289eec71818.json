Several members of his fishing union were murdered during a pipeline protest a few years ago. Petrobras denies any connection with the deaths, but Alexandre says his friends were killed by guards and militias linked to the company.</p> \n  <p>He’s now under a federal protection programme, but he still patrols the bay in search of oil spills, illegal construction and other environmental crimes.</p> \n  <p>“Guanabara Bay is a sacred place for us. We respect it like a church,” he says. “But the bay is becoming an industrial hub in a disgusting and criminal way.”</p> \n  <p>Few Cariocas, as Rio’s residents are known, are aware of the extent of Petrobras’ sprawl across the land and water.</p> \n  <p>It started in 1961 and has accelerated dramatically since the discovery of the pre-salt fields. To demonstrate, Alexandre takes The Guardian on patrol. Starting from his quiet fishing village in Mag&eacute;, we first pass by a propene and ethylene terminal, which began operating in 2008, then the Iesa shipyard where several oil tankers are being refitted.</p> \n  <p>Further along the shore, Alexandre points out the vast Duque de Caxias refinery, which stretches across the horizon, belching murky smoke from six chimneys, then a liquified natural gas terminal and a smaller refinery on Redonda Island, which is undergoing expansion.</p> \n  <p>Near Rio-Niter&oacute;i bridge, we spy the famous tourist sites - Sugar Loaf Mountain and the Christ the Redeemer statue - but closer to the shore are storage tanks, huge warehouses, factories and shipyards - almost all of which are geared towards the oil industry: General Electric pipes and cables, a huge drilling platform waiting for a refit, a cluster of shiny-new mini refineries waiting to be loaded on to floating platforms by an enormous crane painted in the canary yellow and green colours of the national flag, the national team and the national oil company.</p> \n  <p>Guanabara, it seems, has become Petrobras Bay.</p> \n  <p>Altogether, there are at least two refineries, four terminals, four shipyards, as well as countless storage tanks, support ships, service factories and underwater pipelines.</p> \n  <p>The waters - now deemed too dirty to swim in - are like the forecourt of a giant petrol station.</p> \n  <p>Instead of cars lining up at the pumps, there are 30 huge tankers waiting to load or unload oil and gas at the terminals. A huge new refinery will soon be added to the list. Petrobras’s Comperj plant is now under construction close to the northeast - and currently least spoiled - corner of the bay. It will be the destination for gas from the pre-salt fields once a new pipeline is completed later this year.</p> \n  <p>Alexandre vows to fight this threat.</p> \n  <p>“Once Comperj is finished, the impact of Petrobras will spread right across the bay. We hope that refinery won’t be viable because of the low price of oil, because of the struggle by people like us, and because of the growing clamour in society about the environment,” he says.</p> \n </noscript> \n</figure>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435226736148/dd65b435-9d51-46ba-ba84-32a0402a1923-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Felix Clay/Felix Clay for The Guardian","altText":"An oil rig in Guanabara Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
