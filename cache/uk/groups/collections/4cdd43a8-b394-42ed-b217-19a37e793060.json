By the time some get around to reading this the contest will already be under way, and we will know what the first morning brought. Whether the opening delivery was sent straight to a startled second slip, was spanked past point for four, or left alone to fly by wide of off-stump. Nothing in cricket, few things in sport, are as storied as the Ashes.</p> \n<p>From the very first Test at The Oval – when WG Grace <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2013/jun/27/20-great-ashes-moments-fred-spofforth\" title=\"\">gulled Sammy Jones</a> into giving away his wicket, and in doing so goaded “The Demon” Spofforth into taking seven English wickets for 44 runs – through to the very last, in January 2014. An England team cobbled together out of their reserves, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jan/05/ashes-2013-14-australia-england--whitewash\" title=\"\">skittled again, in Sydney this time</a>. All out in 32 overs on the third afternoon of the match. In seven weeks, we’ll have a few more tales to add.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/ashes-2015-stuart-broad-james-anderson-partnership\">Ashes 2015: Stuart Broad and James Anderson is a partnership of equals | Mike Selvey</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>These are the series that shape cricketers’ careers, for better and worse. Ask Simon Kerrigan or Boyd Rankin, both rocked back by their debut failures. Or Ben Stokes, reputation made by his batting and bowling performances on that last tour. Some say we put too much weight on it all, and they might be right. But knowing it is so doesn’t change anything. So, the five men in England’s squad who have never played a Test against Australia know that this summer could be the making or the breaking of them.</p> \n<p>Old hands, too, know what they do this summer will count in the ledger. Especially the captains. If England lose, it seems likely Alastair Cook will give up the captaincy to concentrate on opening the batting. If England win, Michael Clarke will have lost all four Ashes tours he has been on, including the two he has led.</p> \n<p>Just as it is often a mistake to judge a book by the cover, it’s another to read too much into the runup to the series. Ashes history isn’t exactly written by the winners, but it is shaped in hindsight, and everything that’s happened to both teams in these past few weeks and months will be recast to fit with what is about to unfold. The England and Wales Cricket Board’s decision to sack Peter Moores and hire Trevor Bayliss could come to be seen as a turning point. Likewise, if Australia’s two young tyros, Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, struggle to find their lines, then <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/ryan-harris-australia-cricket-retirement-knee-injury-ashes\" title=\"\">Ryan Harris’s retirement</a> may end up looking like one of the defining moments of the tour. If Starc and Hazlewood fire, then the injury to Harris will be a little footnote, worth no more than a line or two in next year’s Almanack.</p> \n<p>Still, right now, before a ball has even been bowled, the contest looks tighter, and the two teams are closer together, than seemed likely in the spring. This despite the gap in the rankings (England are a distant fifth) and in their recent form. Australia hammered West Indies only a few weeks after England eked out a draw against them. For English fans, the first flutter of fresh hope was felt at Lord’s in late May, and the 161-run stand Ben Stokes and Joe Root shared on the very first day, followed in short order by an innings of 162 from Alastair Cook, his largest century since the 190 he made in Kolkata at the tail-end of 2012. Everything is easier when Cook is making runs. If defeat at Headingley rocked England back, they rallied again in the ODI series that followed.</p> \n<p>At the same time, Australia have looked just a little vulnerable in the two matches they have played on tour, both of them against sides in the bottom half of the County Championship’s second division. Nathan Lyon took one for 200 against Essex, at a rate of six runs an over in one innings and five an over in the other. And intimidating as Australia’s battery of quicks is, fact is that Daniel Bell-Drummond, Tom Westley, and Ravi Bopara all took centuries off them in those two games.</p> \n<p>For all Mitchell Johnson’s fire, the 23 wickets he has taken in the seven Tests he has played in England have come at a cost of 38 runs each. Harris, a bowler of heart, skill and speed, was the one English fans – and batsmen – were wary of when Australia’s tour party was announced. Since Harris made his debut, Australia have played 54 Tests. Harris played in half of them. Of those, they won 16 and lost six. In the other half, the ones he missed, they won only nine, and lost 13. Without Harris, Australia will have three new-ball bowlers to work with – Johnson, Starc and Hazlewood. Someone will have to pick up Harris’s slack, and as Ricky Ponting has just written, unless they pick Peter Siddle, the job will likely fall to Shane Watson. A considerably less intimidating proposition.</p> \n<p>England fans are pessimistic beasts, in part because their team prefers to play the underdog. If you’re having a hard time imagining that they will be anything other than thrashed, try flipping the whole thing around for a moment. Imagine that the identities of the two teams had switched. Imagine that it was Australia who were unbeaten in their last three Ashes series at home (2005, 2009 and 2013), that it was Australia who had, in fact, won only two of the 15 Ashes Tests they had played away in that time.</p> \n<p>That it was England whose best bowler had just quit cricket because of a chronic injury problem, England whose spinner had just been hammered by a Division Two side, England whose batting lineup included two 37-year-olds, and a 35-year-old who had only just made his debut. Plenty of reasons there for English fans to feel cautiously optimistic, at least until the nerves kick in on Wednesday morning.</p> \n<p><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email, to subscribe just visit </em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fprofile.theguardian.com%2Femail-prefs%3FCMP%3DEMCSPTEML942\" title=\"\"><em>this page</em></a><em>, find ‘The Spin’ and follow </em><a href=\"https://profile.theguardian.com/signin?returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fprofile.theguardian.com%2Femail-prefs%3FCMP%3DEMCSPTEML942\" title=\"\"><em>the instructions</em></a><em>.</em></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436272323854/0dfd4076-3461-448c-84aa-644d39804745-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"James Marsh/BPI/REX Shutterstock/James Marsh/BPI/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Mitchell Johnson","cleanCredit":"Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/REX Shutterstock/James Marsh/BPI/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T12:37:34Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T14:05:56Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":81,"contributors":[{"name":"Andy Bull","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733420/AndyBull.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/andybull"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Sport","Cricket","Ashes 2015","England cricket team","Australia cricket team"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Andy Bull","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/andybull"}}],"series":{"title":"The Spin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/series/thespin"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/the-spin-the-ashes-england-australia","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aedd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/07/the-spin-the-ashes-england-australia","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/07/the-spin-the-ashes-england-australia"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436272323854/0dfd4076-3461-448c-84aa-644d39804745-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mitchell Johnson traumatised England in Australia last time out, but his record in away Ashes series is not as formidable.

The Australian team is not as invincible as many seem to think, while England are better than they are being given credit for and improving. There is little between the sides. In the end it may well come down to the Australians’ ability to remove the lower England order, something that was key in the last series.</p> \n<p><strong>What will the score be?</strong> I’d like to think that a revitalised England can extend their winning run of home Ashes series and they can do so if they play out of their socks. The influence of Trevor Bayliss and Paul Farbrace will be interesting. Even so optimism says no more than 2-2, so that Australia retain the Ashes, but 2-1 or even 3-1 to Australia is more realistic. England tend to do well at Trent Bridge and Edgbaston, though, and indeed Lord’s.

Only the detonator cap exploded. The rest of it, mostly a mixture of chapatti flour and cheap hydrogen peroxide, failed to ignite. At that very moment, and just a couple of miles away, England <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/jul/21/ashes2005.ashes9\" title=\"\">took their fifth wicket of the first morning</a>. Michael Clarke lbw to Simon Jones for 11. While the players ate lunch, a second bomb went off at Oval and a third at Warren Street. Twenty minutes into <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/jul/21/ashes2005.ashes11\" title=\"\">the afternoon session</a>, so did a fourth on board the No26 bus on Hackney Road. Like the first, all three malfunctioned. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/jul/21/ashes2005.ashes13\" title=\"\">By stumps</a> England were 92 for seven, 88 runs behind, and London’s public transport network was pretty much up and running again. Leaving the ground, spectators experienced what Wisden described as “minor transport disruption” travelling home.</p> \n<p>The failed attacks and their aftermath filled the front pages as the Ashes did the back. During the first Test English police were in the middle of the largest manhunt in their history. On the second day Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead at Stockwell tube station. All this in the wake of the 7/7 attacks, which themselves had come the day after the city had been chosen as the host city for the 2012 Olympic Games. Australia’s fast bowler Jason Gillespie spoke about his unease. “If another bomb did go off here in England there’d be serious questions asked about the tour.” If there was another attack, he said, he would fly back to Australia. Behind the scenes the ECB’s support staff met the police to make plans for tighter security around the grounds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/06/ashes-2015-a-to-z\">Ashes 2015: the A to Z of Ashes history</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The attacks would have a direct effect on the shape of the Ashes summer, as we shall see. But they had a diffuse influence on it too. The euphoria so many people felt in August and September can be seen, in a small way, as a reaction to the horrors of July. On the weekend of the fifth Test at The Oval, more than 20,000 people gathered in Regent’s Park to watch the match on a big screen. A pair of tickets for the second day’s play were sold on eBay for &pound;1,115, and a penthouse flat with a view of the ground was let for the week for a fee of &pound;20,000. Much as we reminisce about the series, it is easy to forget just how extraordinary the summer was; how, when it was all over, the England team became the first identifiable living people outside the Royal Family to be depicted on a set of stamps. Or that the manufacturer Danilo reportedly had 100,000 advance orders for its official Andrew Flintoff calendar.</p> \n<p>There were a lot of reasons for all this lunacy: the brilliance of the contest, the charms of the players, the fact it was all on free-to-air TV and the 16-year wait for a win. But on top of all that, perhaps Britain needed a source of pride, something to celebrate, an excuse to have a party. On the eve of the Oval Test, Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, urged employers to “make arrangements” to allow employees to watch the cricket. People, Barber explained, had to be allowed “to follow their heroes”.</p> \n<p>The crowd at Lord’s on the first day of the series was the largest to have gathered at the ground in 60 years, since, in fact, England played the Dominions in August 1945, the very first first-class match at the ground after the war. England lost then too.</p> \n<h2>Second Test, Edgbaston, 4-7 August, England won by two runs</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bfea61ac351c50d1ce868b3bb64013eb33b7b08\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137276635/58cfdc9c-cb5f-4a50-a1b0-e909de05a099-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The picture of the series: Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee shake hands after the second Test.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The picture of the series: Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee shake hands after the second Test.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I remember on my way to the ground that morning, thinking ‘This shouldn’t take long’,” says Tom Jenkins, the Guardian’s chief sports photographer “just half an hour or something.” England <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/07/ashes2005.ashes6\" title=\"\">needed two wickets</a>, Australia needed 107 runs to win. Once he was there the first task was to pick a spot. He had one in mind, on the low bench behind the boundary hoardings in front of the pavilion. The idea being that from there he could get a shot of the players coming back into the dressing room after they had completed their victory. Tom Shaw, a snapper working for Getty, had the same idea, and the two of them sat side by side.</p> \n<p>The shot they both got, the one that came to symbolise the 2005 Ashes, was not exactly an accident but it was not taken by design either. “The one thought I’d had in my head all morning was ‘I hope Fred takes the last wicket’,” Jenkins says. “Because it would have suited the occasion so well. He had such an amazing match.” So he had. Flintoff scored 68 runs in England’s first innings, 73 in their second. In between he had taken 3 for 52. And then, the previous evening, he had dismissed Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2UnMxR3IM\" title=\"\">the space of a single extraordinary over</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2UnMxR3IM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH2UnMxR3IM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  An extraordinary over by England’s Andrew Flintoff\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jenkins, along with everyone else, made the inevitable comparison. “I was thinking about Botham in ’81 and how, after he had bowled Terry Alderman to win the Test, he had run down the pitch and stooped <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">to pick up a stump as a souvenir</a>. In my head I had a vision of a similar thing happening with Flintoff. He was bowling towards me and I had this vision of him sending Kasprowicz’s stumps flying.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjSDvdgTOzg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjSDvdgTOzg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Ian Botham is not stumped in a choice of souvenir after his magical Ashes performance in 1981\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The crowd had been raucous throughout the match, especially in the Hollies Stand. On the Friday a group of drunken fans threw an inflatable shark at Sir John Major. Major gamely tossed it right back at them. And on the Saturday two more were evicted after a stewardess complained that she found their outfits offensive. They had come dressed as bunny girls. But as Sunday wore on, the ground fell quiet. “People were terrified of what was going to happen. And I knew that, if I had been watching at home, I would have been an absolute wreck too. But because I was working, I had to keep focused.”</p> \n<p>When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/07/ashes2005.ashes7\" title=\"\">the last wicket fell</a>, the first thing Jenkins thought was: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr-4F_SFWxA\" title=\"\">“Oh, that wasn’t great.”</a> From a photographer’s point of view, “it was a mess, with Kasprowicz fending off a bouncer down the leg side.” And then everyone went absolutely bonkers. “And I immediately started thinking, ‘Where’s Flintoff? What is Flintoff doing?’” He found him just in time. “Flintoff had broken away from the pack and was over by Brett Lee. He dropped down and held out his hand to him. It lasted only a second and I didn’t think that much of it at the time” – or later, when he was looking through his photos on his laptop, trying to decide which to send through to the Guardian. “I looked at it and thought, ‘It’s quite nice but I’m sure the desk will want something more celebratory.’” He was right. The Guardian ran a shot of Marcus Trescothick jumping on top of a pile of his team-mates.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr-4F_SFWxA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hr-4F_SFWxA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Not the best moment from a photographer’s point of view but delight for England in 2005.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was only after the Ashes was over that the photo was resurrected. “I still find it strange because it wasn’t a revolutionary picture or a revolutionary act. It was just one guy shaking another by the hand and saying ‘bad luck’. And so it’s surprising to me that that picture seems to have come to symbolise so much.” People often tell Tom that it reminds them of another famous photo, of Bobby Moore hugging Pel&eacute; after England’s defeat by Brazil in the 1970 World Cup. “One thing, now I think about it,” Jenkins says. “Is that TV didn’t get a good shot of it. The picture was fresh. People hadn’t seen it before.”</p> \n<p>What TV did get, however, was enough to fill a DVD. Jeff Foulser was, and still is, the chairman of Sunset + Vine, who were producing the coverage for Channel 4. Almost as soon as the match was over, Foulser got a text message from Gary Franses, his executive producer. “There’s a DVD in this match – The Greatest Test”. The ECB agreed. They wanted it ready ASAP. “Editing, production, distribution, it all had to be done by the end of that same week,” says Franses. “No one had ever done anything like that for cricket before.” By the time the next Test started The Greatest Test was in the shops. It sold 55,000 copies.</p> \n<h2>Third Test, Old Trafford, 11-15 August: match drawn</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dc6daba9cacd48e2c307ef7c1d234c02c272981\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137495536/f4060a17-55c9-46dd-a30c-92f7844b37a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A packed Old Trafford watches on with thousands of ticketless fans locked outside.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A packed Old Trafford watches on with thousands of ticketless fans locked outside.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On 15 August Ken Grime was up shortly after the sun. Usually he worked in the marketing department at Lancashire Cricket Club but during Tests he doubled up as the match manager. He had to start early, to make the drive in to Old Trafford from his house in Bury. By 6.30am he was on his way. When he passed a bus stop, they saw a lad waiting for a ride. He was wearing an England top. ‘He’s keen,’ Grime thought. Then he passed the next bus stop, and saw two more teenagers, both in England shirts. At the third stop there were two men, obviously cricket supporters, you know the type, in hats, holding plastic bags full of food and clutching flasks. “And it was at that point,” Grime says, “that I got a sudden lurch in my stomach.”</p> \n<p>The day before, while England were still batting in the third innings, Grime had been in a meeting with his colleague Peter Ash, and Lancashire’s chief executive, Jim Cumbes. “It was a very brief conversation,” remembers Grime. They had to decide on the ticketing arrangements for the final day since tickets had not been sold in advance. They agreed they would charge &pound;10 for adults, half that for children, cash on the door, gates open 9am. They put an announcement out around the ground, on TV and radio.</p> \n<p>“It was almost a goodwill gesture, really,” Grime says. “The one thing about that meeting I’ve never forgot was that somebody said, ‘Do you think we’ll sell out?’ No one knew. So I said, “I think we’ll get about 14,000.” That would have been two-thirds capacity. At stumps on day three, Australia were 24 for 0, needing a record 423 to win, or to bat out 98 overs to draw the match. At 4am that night, Lancashire’s head of security, Pat McCabe, was woken by a phone call. It was the nightwatchman down at the ground. “Pat,” he said. “You’re not going to believe this, but there are people camping out down here, waiting for tickets.”</p> \n<p>Grime pulled on to Brian Statham Way at 7.30am. Ash had made the same journey an hour earlier. “I remember driving along Talbot Road thinking, ‘Have I overslept?’” Ash says, “because there were all these people walking towards the ground, more and more and more of them. I was sure my watch was broken.” By the time Grime arrived “the ground was absolutely surrounded. I will never forget it. I thought, ‘Oh My God! What have we done?’”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/michael-clarke-captain-australia-ashes-england\">Michael Clarke has evolved into a captain Australia has finally learned to love | Geoff Lemon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ash was already inside. “We got a load of market trader aprons and reels of tickets, the old ones where you rip the stubs off, and opened up early, at 8am. Thing was we were letting more and more people in but the queues weren’t going down, they were getting bigger and bigger. People kept appearing from all over.” The queues finally stretched all the way back to the metro station and it was then that the police stepped in. They shut the tram stations in town, to stop more people boarding. “We knew by then we couldn’t get everyone in. But people were shoving their money at us and shouting, ‘I’ll pay more than the person in front!’”</p> \n<p>Colin Gibson was the ECB’s head of communications. “I remember I had to do an interview with BBC radio Five Live, on the breakfast show with Victoria Derbyshire. And she said, ‘What’s your message to people who are planning to come today?’ and I had to say ‘Please, please don’t, because you’ll never get into the ground.’” Even the players were struggling to get to the ground. Andrew Flintoff was actually staying at his own home for that match, and the traffic was so bad that he had to skip the wrong way down a one-way street. “I got stopped by the police and had to say, ‘Please, I really need to get there.’ They just waved us through.”</p> \n<p>By 9am the ground was full. Around 20,000 people were stuck outside. “I remember we got a call saying, ‘You can only do 20 more people,’” Ash says. “And it was quite frightening, because I was thinking, ‘These people have been in the queue for that length of time and we’ve got to turn them away. So we sort of retreated back inside and had to push the gates across. And I just remember seeing all these hands coming through the gates clutching their 10-pound notes, people shouting, ‘Please, please will you let me in.’ It felt awful but you just couldn’t do anything about it. I’ve been here 21 years, and it is the most memorable day in all that time. The only thing that could have made it any better was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/15/ashes2005.ashes11\" title=\"\">if England had taken that last wicket</a>.” Australia, 371 for 9 at the close, survived by one wicket. Lee ended the match on the ground again, this time pounding it in triumph after surviving the final 24 balls with Glenn McGrath for company.</p> \n<h2>Fourth Test, Trent Bridge, 25-28 August: England won by three wickets</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be4485f5e79447b123314c241e6dad0be1fe66f3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137686373/be69f2a3-4baa-4d92-92e9-7438265b4b87-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The partnership of Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles, pictured here between Ian Bell Geraint Jones, at the Oval, was crucial in the fourth Test.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The partnership of Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles, pictured here between Ian Bell Geraint Jones, at the Oval, was crucial in the fourth Test.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Finn-Kelcey/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the least well known of the many accomplishments of Mark Nicholas is the fact that he is the man who made Mambo No5 a hit in Britain. In 1999 the production team at Sunset + Vine were struggling to find a piece of music for their new gig producing Channel 4’s cricket coverage. “We were all sitting around thinking, ‘What the hell are we going to do for opening titles?’” says the executive producer Franses. “Until one day Mark came in and stuck this track on. And after a second we all thought, ‘Thank you!” First time around that year, Mambo No5 stalled at No31 in the UK chart. Re-released in August, it shot to No1 and stayed there for a fortnight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCEHREGc6yY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCEHREGc6yY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  One of the flops of the series … but at least it was off the field of play.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ECB wanted the soundtrack to the summer of 2005 to be Jerusalem. In the end the long (and best) forgotten <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCEHREGc6yY\" title=\"\">official version was one of the team’s few flops</a>, peaking at No19. But for most cricket fans it is almost impossible to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRNaKp0hUg8\" title=\"\">listen to Mambo No 5</a> without a) thinking of Michael Vaughan’s pull shot and b) smiling at the memory. Which is odd, since, as Bega explains, his song is really about “sitting in the English Gardens in Munich, watching all these lovely ladies walk by”. (Turns out Jessica, Sandra, Rita and Monica were all real people.) Bega is German “and, as you know, cricket isn’t really a sport we follow in mainland Europe”. But his record company did arrange for him to visit a match. “I liked it because to me cricket seemed like baseball without all the spitting. And besides, I’d say that I’m, like, at least 50% of the reason why England won.”</p> \n<p>Sunset + Vine’s coverage was designed to make the sport accessible to people who were not necessarily experts. “Connoisseurs watch all the time, win or lose,” Franses explains. “But we hoped that at some point it would catch on with the general public so that a few uncommitted people might get into it.” They bought in the Snickometer, Hawk-Eye and the pitch mat, all designed to make the game easier to understand. They gave over the little breaks between to Simon Hughes, to explain the tactics and terminology of the game. “By 2005 we’d been doing it for six years by then so we knew what we were doing.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRNaKp0hUg8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRNaKp0hUg8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The new sound of cricket in 2005\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In previous years Channel 4’s coverage had been pulling in “two million viewers on a good day”. In 2005 “the ratings were sensational. I think there were more than five million people watching on average each day. Which is unheard of.” Compared with the 2001 Ashes, the proportion of female viewers was up by just under 10% and the proportion of under-15s by almost 75%. At first the cricket had to fight for screen time with the horse racing, and there were often a lot of complaints that it cut into Channel 4’s evening programming. Later in the summer the executives stopped worrying about that. “Racing hardly got a look in, because the cricket was delivering,” says Foulser. “Never mind the number of times Hollyoaks got cancelled because the cricket was over-running!”</p> \n<p>The ratings peaked late on the fourth day at Trent Bridge, as Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/28/ashes2005.ashes8\" title=\"\">eked out the runs England needed to win</a>. 8.4m people tuned in to watch. “It became prime time,” says Franses. “You felt the whole country was watching that. We realised then that this was bigger than anything we had been before. And to be honest, I think it was probably bigger than anything that has happened in cricket since.” Foulser agrees. “That was the one. That was when it began to feel like a national event.” By the end of the year Sunset + Vine’s boxset of the series had become the biggest-selling sports DVD of all time. “We shifted 635,000 units.”</p> \n<p>Shame was the success felt bitter-sweet. “We’d been told the previous December that Channel 4 had lost the rights, so we knew it was going to be our last summer,” says Foulser. “When they saw the ratings, people at C4 were asking, ‘Have we made a bit of a cock-up here?’ But they were just outbid. Sky paid a lot of money for the rights and everything has a price. But I remember C4 had very mixed feelings about it, because the cricket had really over-delivered for them.”</p> \n<p>“We connected with an audience probably as much as anybody has ever done,” Foulser says. “On the last day at The Oval the camera guys got a shot of some fans holding a banner saying ‘Thanks 4 the memories’, with the C4 logo.

Trading on the stock market was down by 20%. Trafficlink, the firm providing real-time traffic information, reported that in London the roads were “a lot quieter than usual as people stay home or stay on longer in the office to watch the cricket”. Tony Blair, taking a tour of the City of London Academy, had to apologise for dragging his audience away from the small television set in the corner of the hall and ended his speech with an update from The Oval.</p> \n<p>At Southwark Crown Court, a clerk opened the proceedings in a complex fraud trial by offering to provide a series of display cards through the day to show the latest scores. The Confederation of British Industry approved. They advised employers that “on an occasion as exciting and as big as this week’s Ashes” employers should “be flexible in allowing staff to keep tabs on the score”. Even The Queen, we were told, was watching at Balmoral. Certainly <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/sep/12/ashes2005.ashes12\" title=\"\">when the match was drawn and the Ashes won</a>, she sent her “warmest congratulations” to the two teams.</p> \n<p>By then it was all over, except for one little group who were just beginning the longest night of the summer. On the Sunday evening of the fourth Test, a handful of ECB employees gathered together to work out what to do if England won. They called it Operation Victory. It was top-secret. England’s coach, Duncan Fletcher, insisted that the players could not be allowed to find out about it, which was why the ECB denied the story whenever journalists got wind of it.</p> \n<p>The plan, pushed by the team’s sponsors, was to stage a “people’s parade” in Birmingham, ending at Edgbaston. “Because of the bombings we had always thought that, if England won the Ashes, it would be very unlikely we would do a street parade,” says Gibson. “Because there was so much nervousness about doing it.” But on Monday 5 September, three days before the start of the final Test, the ECB got a call from the Mayor of London’s office. Ken Livingstone was adamant that, if there was going to be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/sep/13/ashes2005.ashes12\" title=\"\">a victory parade</a>, it had to be in London and specifically in Trafalgar Square – the same spot, of course, where there had been a party when London won the Olympic bid. “He really wanted the world to see that London was open for business and he thought that this was the way to do it.”</p> \n<p>On the Tuesday the ECB was given the green light. Its event manager, David Clarke, popped along to the mayor’s office for a meeting. “I was expecting there would be about five people around a table and there were about 30, including the river police and the man in charge of wastebins on the route, all sorts.” The ECB had to organise the stage, the security and the broadcasting arrangements with all four of Sky, ITV, the BBC and Channel 4. Everyone wanted live coverage. Then it had to negotiate with the City of London, the mayor’s office and its own sponsors. There was a late twist to the plan when another call came through from the prime minister’s office, explaining that Blair would be keen to host the team after they had left Trafalgar Square.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/ashes-2015-mitchell-starc-australians-england-tail\">Ashes 2015: Mitchell Starc and Australians plan to sting England’s tail</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And then the ECB had to wait. No one knew whether any of this was actually going to happen and, as the fortunes of the two teams fluctuated through the final day, the parade was on, then off, then on, then off, then on again. England were 127 for 5 at lunch, with a lead of only 133. “It was only in the last hour of the last day of the last Test that we knew for sure,” Gibson says. The ECB had two buses ready in a depot in Hertfordshire, waiting to be painted in the sponsor’s colours. “Those buses were going in and out, and in and out, of the garage. At 6pm I remember someone asked me, ‘Do you think it’s safe we can get the bus painted now?’” By 6am the next day the buses were outside the team hotel at Tower Hill. So were several crates of champagne sent by Elton John, one reason why Flintoff had to be poured off the bus into Trafalgar Square.</p> \n<p>Everyone had been so busy making the last-minute arrangements that no one had really stopped to ask how many people were actually going to turn out. “That morning we all wondered, ‘Will anybody actually come out?’” says Gibson. “And then when we left the hotel and the bus turned the corner, we saw all these people lining the road up Tower Hill. It was packed at nine o’clock.” Clarke was already in Trafalgar Square. “I got there at 5.30 that morning and there were people already there,” he says. At one point he got a call from a steward asking if he knew who Brian Lara was “because there was a man claiming to be him down in the crowd and he wanted to get through to see the team.” It really was Lara, who had stopped off on his way to the airport.</p> \n<p>Best estimates are that around 50,000 came out to cheer on the team. “And I remember thinking,” Clarke says, “‘All this? Over a bloody cricket series?” A cricket series and so much more.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436137142814/91ae44d3-697f-41dc-8b4f-3efc6ab8007a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Philip Brown/Getty Images","altText":"Michael Vaughan, Kevin Pietersen and Andrew Flintoff celebrate with the urn after winning the greatest Ashes series.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Philip Brown/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137278017/58cfdc9c-cb5f-4a50-a1b0-e909de05a099-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The picture of the series: Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee shake hands after the second Test.

It was getting irritating. Jason Holder and Denesh Ramdin had been batting for the past 32 overs, adding 105 for the seventh wicket to frustrate England. The pitch was slow, offering little, and the second new ball already more than 30 overs old.</p> \n<p>Before the over started Anderson, wearying, had walked back to his mark and engaged in conversation with Stuart Broad, standing at mid-off.</p> \n<p>“Try some leg cutters,” Broad said, “hold the seam straight down rather than across, fingers alongside and just rip it.” So Anderson gave it a go. The first one, to Ramdin, failed to grip on the pitch and held its line, and the batsman, a half-century to his name already, defended it easily enough on off stump. Anderson tried again. This time the seam caught the ground, the ball deviated away from Ramdin’s defensive prod, took the outside edge, and Alastair Cook made a tumbling catch at first slip. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/18/west-indies-england-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">Anderson wheeled away in triumph</a>.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, Anderson acknowledged the part that his bowling partner had played in creating the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/17/jimmy-anderson-proud-england-leading-wicket-taker\" title=\"\">record-breaking delivery</a>. Bowling can be a solitary occupation but within that it can also be collaborative. Broad’s habitual position at mid-off or mid-on when Anderson is bowling, and that of Anderson in the same positions when Broad is operating, are significant, at odds with the customary pace bowlers’ post-over stroll to fine leg to graze and catch breath. The pair are in constant communication, and, as with the leg-cutter, bounce ideas from one to the other, communicating them through to Cook in his executive role.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/2005-alternative-history-greatest-ashes\">2005 and all that: an alternative history of the greatest Ashes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That fast bowlers hunt in pairs (leaving aside the exception of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2011/may/12/west-indies-fast-bowlers-fire-in-babylon\" title=\"\">West Indies side of the decade from mid-70s to 80s</a>, who operated as an interchangeable pack) is one of the cliches of cricket. Some have become such that one bowler tends not be mentioned without the other: Trueman forever allied with Statham; Lindwall with Miller; Larwood and Voce; Hall and Griffith, Lillee and Thomson; Botham and Willis; Donald and Pollock; McGrath and Gillespie; and so on. Some are simply identified by first names, or even abbreviations, alone: Waz ’n’ Waqar; Curtly and Courtney. It will never be Jimmy and Stuart, butBroad and Anderson (somehow it trips off the tongue better that way round) should be included in the list.</p> \n<p>When they do so in Cardiff, no pair of England bowlers will have taken the field with more wickets between them than their 676, already 56 more than the total Botham and Willis had accrued by the end of the latter’s final Test in 1984. In matches they have played together, Anderson and Broad have taken 569 wickets – 296 to Anderson, 273 to Broad – which means a further 11 will see them overtake the Botham-Willis alliance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/06/ashes-2015-a-to-z\">Ashes 2015: the A to Z of Ashes history</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Partnerships such as this work in separate but distinct ways. The collaborative element, the sharing of information and ideas, is an important one but so too is the competition that such a relationship can create.</p> \n<p>A personal illustration might be the couple of years at Middlesex when I opened the bowling with Allan Jones. We were friends, travelled to matches together, shared a beer together. But he knew, because I told him, that although I enjoyed his success and the contribution it made to the team effort, part of me still begrudged him every wicket he got because it was one fewer for me to try to take. It would be unusual if Broad and Anderson did not harbour similar sentiments.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/englands-stuart-broad-puts-up-his-dukes-as-he-relishes-villainous-role\" title=\"\">Broad may be entitled to feel more than a little miffed</a> at the perception of the relative values of the two when it comes to the England team. In the leadup to this Ashes series much has been made of the importance of Anderson, and his use of the new ball, to any possible England success. For some years, it is Anderson whose brilliance is seen as being absolutely integral to England, and there is no question he has earned his place in the pantheon of great England cricketers. Broad, on the other hand, is viewed as mercurial, inconsistent, off the pace all too often, and not infrequently the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jan/27/stuart-broad-minimum-wage-england-humble\" title=\"\">source of public opprobrium</a>. Where Anderson’s place is inviolate, Broad’s often appears to be hanging by a thread.</p> \n<p>Look at the records of the two bowlers over the past two and a half years. Between them, they have taken fractionally more than half of England’s 459 wickets in that time. But which of them has taken most and at what cost? The answer to the first part is neither: since new year, 2013 Anderson and Broad have both taken 115 Test wickets. They have done so at an average, for Anderson, of 27.00, and for Broad, of 26.53. Anderson has taken five wickets in an innings on five occasions and had a single 10-wicket match, the Trent Bridge Test at the start of the last Ashes series here. Broad, though, has seven five-wicket hauls in that same period and a 10-wicket match at Chester-le-Street in that same Ashes series. Anderson’s Nottingham haul, and that of Broad in the north-east, were huge contributing factors in the two victories that secured that series.</p> \n<p>It may not be how the cricket public perceives it but the Broad and Anderson partnership is one of equals.</p> \n<p>How the Ashes pace attacks compare</p> \n<h2> </h2> \n<p><strong>ENGLAND </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Jimmy Anderson </strong>England’s highest wicket-taker and part of a formidable duo with Stuart Broad. When the ball swings and he can pursue a full length, there is no finer bowler in the world, his command of the ball mesmerising. Also dangerous when reversing the old ball. Has to work a lot harder for wickets when there is no lateral movement. Unusually, his default to left-handers is to swing the ball away from them rather than challenge the pads.</p> \n<p><strong>Stuart Broad</strong> A counterpoint to Anderson. Broad can have quiet periods and then suddenly will get on a roll when wickets seem an inevitability. He has been successful when bowling a fuller length but it does not naturally suit the arc of his swing and can tend to float. When under pressure, he tends to drop his length back. Not a huge swinger of the ball, but height lends him bounce and he has an excellent bouncer.</p> \n<p><strong>Mark Wood</strong> Can be rapid and a relative lack of height means he is a skiddy bowler. With a short run and explosive action, he tries to bowl a full length from which he can swing it, similar to Simon Jones. He is an excellent exponent of reverse swing which will be important if the weather stays dry. He has played few first-class matches and, coupled with injury, there is a question mark over his stamina: after an excellent debut Test at Lord’s he was off the pace at Headingley. Will need careful management.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74fe817faa504b8f1534077970285d3bed4de3db\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436203821333/d1dd35f0-940b-41d0-ae35-81a5e24534a3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Wood's reverse swing could be crucial.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wood’s reverse swing could be crucial.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Steven Finn</strong> Starting to get some confidence back after a trying two years. He is still not back to the sort of devastating pace he showed in India and New Zealand three years ago. There are kinks in his action that persist but he is still pacy enough to cause problems. He retains the capacity to take wickets and may well be used during the series.</p> \n<p><strong>Liam Plunkett</strong> Tall, willing, fast at times, and extremely fit. He too can exploit a fullish length, targeting the top of off stump, but in the past has been used to rough up the opposition as well. Like Finn, he could well be used on a rotational basis, if not during this series then in the next six months. Not involved at Cardiff but in England’s thoughts.</p> \n<p><strong>AUSTRALIA</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Johnson</strong> Nothing more than a simple change to the angle of his approach transformed him from a figure of fun to a world-class bowler to be feared. Probably the fastest bowler in the world now, he will play a huge part in targeting England’s lower order. Can have his confidence dented, though, and has an unhappy experience of bowling in England. Rarely swings the ball into the right-hander intentionally but occasionally it clicks into place. His low delivery arm means his bouncer skids nastily.</p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Starc</strong> Has the potential to be the bowler of the series now that Ryan Harris has been ruled out. A tall, pacy left-armer who swings the ball into the right-hander and will have noted the success of Trent Boult earlier in the summer. He will enjoy bowling to England’s plethora of left-handed batsmen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfd4d50ec6d1ff239e5a5ac793f6ad7e258917ab\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436203934782/a45700a1-a356-47fa-a4cc-6045de7315a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mitchell Starc could be bowler of the series.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell Starc could be bowler of the series.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Josh Hazlewood</strong> Tall, accurate and quick enough, he may take time to adjust his length to the demands of bowling over here. Once he has done so, he could well complete a formidable pace trio with Johnson and Starc. Comparisons are inevitable: for Hazlewood it is with Glenn McGrath.</p> \n<p><strong>Peter Siddle</strong> An absolutely indefatigable right-armer who for the cause will bowl until he drops, pick himself up and go some more. If Hazlewood cannot yet be trusted to do the stock job, then there is no one better than Siddle. Having said this, his pace is said to be down on what it once was.</p> \n<p><strong>Pat Cummins</strong> Called into the squad following the departure of Harris. He was first selected when 18, the youngest Australia debutant for six decades, and immediately took six wickets against South Africa. Only 22, he has suffered serious injury and has not played a first-class match for almost a year and six only in his career.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436201941874/Stuart-Broad-and-James-An-005.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stuart Broad and James Anderson celebrate during the second Test against New Zealand at Headingley in May.

Or when Allan Border lost his cool with Craig McDermott in ‘93? Glenn McGrath’s 8-38 at Lord’s and Jason Gillespie’s 7-37 at Headingley? What about Adam Gilchrist’s blazing 152 at Edgbaston in 2001?</p> \n<p>It’s always been a dodgy premise for Australians, that “where were you when…” Ashes question, because unless you paid some exorbitant amount of money to get sunburnt and drunk on the hill with Jeff Thomson and 25 balding men in matching polos, we all know exactly where we were; half-asleep and huddled under blankets on the sofa.</p> \n<p>Personally I remember each Ashes series by the houses I was living in when they happened; 1989-2001: tucked up in bed at Mum and Dad’s listening to the radio with the ABC cricket guide opened on my chest; 2005: in a squalid share house surrounded by empty pizza boxes and the stench of stale beer; 2009: in a slightly less squalid share house surrounded by empty pizza boxes and the stench of stale beer; 2013: co-habitation with its fancy non-Ikea furniture and proper meals cooked on stoves, but at the end of play still dozing off on the sofa for that deep, doomed three-and-a-half-hour Ashes micro-nap.</p> \n<p>As a child, the former ABC cricket broadcaster Neville Oliver got his Ashes fix listening to radio descriptions and rode the resultant waves of emotion each morning after. “Defeat at the hands of England [was] such a desolate happening as to be worth a day off school,” he said. “Victory was as good as the end of school year.” </p> \n<p>To remember each series better we also have all those creaking shelves-worth of Ashes themed books; The Ashes Crown the Year; Fight for the Ashes; Operation Ashes; Botham’s Ashes; Boony’s Ashes; The Ashes Retained; The Ashes Thrown Away; Aussies and Ashes; Ashes to Ashes; Martin McCague’s Bumper Book of Ashes Anecdotes. Okay, the last is a slight embellishment.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/06/ashes-2015-a-to-z\">Ashes 2015: the A to Z of Ashes history</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Maybe Australia’s mood isn’t quite as cricket-dependent these days but knowing glances will be shared by those yawning into smart phones and scrolling through the Cricinfo app on the train. That meeting can definitely be shifted back to 10am, by the way. Your tax return? Do it in September. We’re all in this together. Except for my sister-in-law. I don’t think she realises yet the true reason that my brother just took six weeks of long service leave. I guess she will soon. Good luck Pete.</p> \n<p>In actual fact no-one should get too worried about prolonged sleep deprivation or major marital conflict this time because the 2015 Ashes series will fly past us rapidly; 25 days of cricket crammed into just 48 days of svelte schedule. Now Australia’s standby players make do with a three-day tour match wedged between the 2nd and 3rd Tests and one other following the 4th, by which time their input might be irrelevant. Covering the languidly-paced 1953 series, former Australian Test opener Jack Fingleton also had time to take in the coronation of Queen Elizabeth, the climactic stages of a thrilling Ryder Cup at Wentworth and also met England’s executioner. If he’d been assigned to this one he’d be lucky to see much more than press boxes and hotel rooms.</p> \n<p>The stage has been set well for this series thanks to the now-compulsory verbal wars, which have established a new benchmark in pre-Ashes nonsense; English paceman Mark Wood almost inventing his own rivalry with fringe all-rounder Shane Watson, Watson replying quite predictably that encounters with net bowlers aren’t prominent among his great cricket anecdotes; <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/joe-root-david-warner-interview-2013-walkabout-punch\">Joe Root’s disappointment</a> over David Warner’s disappointment over their mutually disappointing behaviour at a nightspot we can probably all agree was a particularly disappointing choice of drinking venue; Ben Stokes preemptively stating <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/england-ben-stokes-australia-intimidation-cricket\">he could handle any sledging</a> that comes his way; <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/29/ashes-england-wont-come-close-steve-smith\">Steve Smith kicking off all of that sledging stuff </a> before the Australians even arrived; Stuart Broad’s suggestion that run-machine Smith <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/graeme-swann-england-no1-steve-smith-ashes-australia-icc-test-rankings\">might in fact be a bit shaky</a>, presumably in the way that Bradman was often susceptible once he’d passed 200. By the time the first ball is bowled today in Cardiff, hopefully we’ve also established which of Root and Warner’s fathers is fastest and strongest.</p> \n<p>Amid all this froth, a few important events have also transpired. Ryan Harris has sadly succumbed to injury, dead level with Bruce Reid in claiming 113 wickets from 27 Tests and the source of universal lament that the game couldn’t have had him for one last bone-grinding burst of energy. With no small amount of irony Harris has been replaced in the Australian squad by the unfortunately-nicknamed Pat ‘Cummo’ Cummins, star of as many <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DjEpLnUbD0Y/UTgagZcaASI/AAAAAAAAAcU/FPx6U9fLMNE/s1600/BUPA+Cummins+Hussey+Haddin.jpg\">health insurance advertising campaigns</a> as Test matches. </p> \n<p>That’s not the only upheaval within Australia’s ranks either. The internal battle for almost half the positions in the Cardiff Test XI paints a far murkier picture of the side’s likely fate in this series than they like to project. The buoyancy of Smith’s batting and World Cup success only partially obscure the fact that Watson, Michael Clarke, Brad Haddin and Chris Rogers are all creaking towards the finish line in Tests. Those who sit at the fringes could at any point be thrown into the fray. </p> \n<p>And England? If Australia gets it emphatically right we might see the dethroning of an Alastair Cook as captain, giving the series a retro dash of Athertonian (Gowerian? Goochian?) dread. The greater joy for Australians is that England’s 13-man squad for Cardiff boasts five players – dynamic keeper-batsman Jos Buttler, opener Adam Lyth, spinner Adil Rashid, all-rounder Moeen Ali and paceman Wood – who’ve yet to feature in an Ashes Test and so provide the series most of its novelty allure.</p> \n<p>History tells us that lamentably few Ashes series’ in recent memory have been tight run and recent form dictates that Australia enter this one with favoritism. But let’s be honest, this is a rivalry in which the cocky favourite has so often found comeuppance and for that, Australians should remain alert and awake.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4e69017c0f983453577f8f08924755f62f2745ec/0_79_3018_1812/3018.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1812,"width":3018,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jason O'Brien/Action Images","altText":"Glenn McGrath Australia Ashes","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jason O'Brien/Action Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T05:00:02Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T05:26:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":95,"contributors":[{"name":"Russell Jackson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/russell-jackson"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Ashes 2015","The Ashes","Australia cricket team","England cricket team","Cricket","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/ashes","webTitle":"The Ashes"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Russell Jackson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/russell-jackson"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/watching-the-ashes-from-the-other-side-of-the-world-late-nights-and-stale-beer","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aex3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/watching-the-ashes-from-the-other-side-of-the-world-late-nights-and-stale-beer","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/watching-the-ashes-from-the-other-side-of-the-world-late-nights-and-stale-beer"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4e69017c0f983453577f8f08924755f62f2745ec/0_79_3018_1812/3018.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1812,"width":3018,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Glenn McGrath’s scorching spell of bowling at Lords in 2005 will live long in the collective memory.

In a fledgling English summer when the phrase ‘brand of cricket’ has been repeated so often it has all the cross-eyed meaning of ‘red-lorry-yellow-lorry’, how odd and unprecedented it seems that England beat someone else at their own game. It was, after all, New Zealand’s own brand of cricket we were playing.</p> \n<p>And so, with the Ashes upon us, here we are: a nation of cricketers who actually learnt lessons. English sportsmen who said they were going to do something and actually went and did it. Disorientating, yes, and perhaps belated, but nonetheless, an achievement to be celebrated. All it took was a touring side as entertaining and as full of modern virtuoso cricket perspective as New Zealand to free us up. Their captain, Brendon McCullum, turned up as a hero to the likes of Moeen Ali, and left with all his best ideas stolen. It almost felt like an apology was in order. Whisper it, but it looked like playing for England was a lot of fun.</p> \n<p>The fun, one would be forgiven for assuming, is probably over. No sooner had Michael Clarke gotten off the plane than he had asserted that the line of sportsmanship should not be crossed, but that Australia would probably headbutt it. As a mission statement, given the spirit of everything we had only just witnessed against New Zealand, it felt, well, unnecessary. Like a bunch of impossibly typecast American high-school quarterbacks who walk out of a room at a party only to jealously return and find everyone having more fun without them.</p> \n<p>Part of us, let’s face it, wants them to go away already. Take the Ashes back with you if it’s really that important. We’d have been happier watching kwik cricket against New Zealand all summer long. In any case, we’ve all got the 2005 series on DVD and everyone knows that’s the only Ashes that actually mattered. Any England stars-in-waiting worth their salt will already know that if a game is close and we win, the first objective is to shake an Australian’s hand sincerely in an unobstructed view of a camera. You will be remembered forever as some kind of fast bowling Gandhi.</p> \n<p>Begrudgingly though, we must be prepared to accept certain stark realities. The battery of Australian fast bowlers will definitely bombard Moeen’s rib-cage with a bat-pad permanently lodged next to him. They’ll probably exclusively bowl at Stuart Broad’s head. Most ominously of all, they will bowl full and straight at Gary Ballance’s stumps.</p> \n<p>They’ll probably do it all without smiling that much and while chewing gum aggressively at slip. Chris Rogers, crab-like and deceptively un-amateurish, will block and leave for hours while David Warner scores accelerated runs like a far-fetched cricket version of a villain WWF wrestler. We’ll probably congratulate ourselves for weathering early storms with the new ball and then play seven consecutive poor shots to Steve Smith’s part-time leg-breaks. It’s part of the script we expect this time.</p> \n<p>What we hadn’t counted on was that the Kiwis, along with the memories, would leave us something that maybe we could have all done without: a genuine glint of hope.</p> \n<p>There is some kind of newly developed tangible (improbable, but still tangible) evidence that we may offer … resistance. We might even counterattack. We might even attack them out of our own free will. Actually, wait. Is there enough evidence to suggest there is significant personality and talent in this team to truly capture the country’s imagination once again?</p> \n<p>They do – again, whisper it – fit the bill. Adam Lyth has a ready-made terrace anthem waiting for him in a Des’ree hit single from the 90’s. Moeen and Joe Root, refreshingly, do interviews with honesty and without gratingly palpable media training. Jos Buttler is basically a sensitive English Adam Gilchrist, in a good way. Mark Wood does something with an imaginary horse which I still don’t really understand and has the weirdest run-up I’ve ever seen. Alex Hales might get a Test match. Sky Sports have already prepared evolution of the ages montages where Botham-becomes-Freddie-becomes-bionic-Stokes. Ben himself even went as far as calling Australia ‘as human as we are’ last week.</p> \n<p>Half of the team are in that magic and fleeting pre-dawn of an England cricketer’s Ashes timeline, unscarred from disastrous series gone by (see Michael Vaughan’s prerequisite from 2005). All this, tied together by a reluctant leader who deserves to win this series more than anyone else despite the longer he goes into his captaincy appearing to be wearing tighter and tighter shirts, probably almost exclusively drinking protein shakes and dressed in an increasingly bizarrely balanced horse riding hat for a batting helmet. Alastair Cook stubbornly and impressively still holds his own around a baying precession of never-ending critique by hundreds and hundreds of people ill-equipped to captain England themselves, and this, if the universe is balanced, must finally come with some substantial reward.</p> \n<p>Having weighed it up, it’s enough to convince me. I’ve convinced myself. We’ll win. I’m not a betting man. And if I was, I wouldn’t actually put money on that. But I would, at the very least, put my house on the cricket being far more competitive than the foregone conclusion that had been assumed in the not too distant past. I’m not sure that’s something you can bet on, that’s not really my forte. But Freddie thinks it could be special and I’m willing to take his word for it. The point I’m making is, whether it be a bit tougher, whether this new hope may hurt occasionally and whether the forthcoming cricket isn’t as wholesome as the New Zealand series just gone, I can’t wait and I hope you can’t either.</p> \n<p><em>The Maccabees’ new album, Marks To Prove It, will be released on 31 July on Fiction Records.

I’ve made it very clear that in the last series if somebody overstepped that mark it was me.</p> \n<p>“As captain of this team I need to be more disciplined, and I know I will be. I think the mutual respect is certainly there. England have a lot of experience and some fantastic players and they deserve that respect. The cricket will be tough on the field, but we’ll know there’s a line you can’t overstep.”</p> \n<p>While opposite number Alastair Cook was keen to play down the fear factor associated with facing Mitchell Johnson, Clarke is tipping the left-armer to play a significant role in the series following his 37-wicket demolition job 18 months ago, claiming question marks over his ability to control the Dukes ball have fired him up further.</p> \n<p>Clarke said: “Mitch is as ready as I’ve seen him, that’s for sure. He’s bowling as fast as I’ve faced in the nets. People doubt how well he can bowl in these conditions, and that’s given him that fire in his belly. Again it will come down to execution. If he can bowl the way he has bowled since we’ve landed in this country, I think he will have a huge impact.”</p> \n<p>Australia will wait until the morning of the match to decide their XI, with Clarke admitting the Cardiff pitch, which was shorn of its green tinge on Tuesday morning, has reduced previous thoughts of playing a four-man pace attack. But he remains confident England, under new head coach Trevor Bayliss, will stick with the team that played in the back-to-back two-Test series with New Zealand.</p> \n<p>Asked if securing a first Ashes win on English soil would cap his own CV, which includes the winter’s World Cup win, Clarke added: “I don’t think it’s about my CV or any individual player’s to be honest. As a team this is our next major challenge. It is no coincidence we haven’t won here since 2001. Beating England in their own back yard is extremely tough. We are excited by the challenge but we know it will be a tough five-Test series.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7f8cb62757d299bacc2c7456fd6194f68644cfad/0_110_2142_1284/2142.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1284,"width":2142,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Davies/PA","altText":"Michael Clarke","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Davies/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T14:08:24Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T23:01:38Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ali Martin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ali-martin"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Ashes 2015","Michael Clarke","Australia cricket team","England cricket team","The Ashes","Australia sport","Cricket","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/michael-clarke","webTitle":"Michael Clarke"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/ashes","webTitle":"The Ashes"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ali Martin","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ali-martin"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/ashes-2015-michael-clarke-australia-england","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aege","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/07/ashes-2015-michael-clarke-australia-england","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/07/ashes-2015-michael-clarke-australia-england"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7f8cb62757d299bacc2c7456fd6194f68644cfad/0_110_2142_1284/2142.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1284,"width":2142,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Australia’s captain, Michael Clarke, is happy for his side to sledge as long as they do not overstep the mark.
