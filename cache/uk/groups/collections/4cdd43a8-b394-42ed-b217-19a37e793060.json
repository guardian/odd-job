All too often the matchmaker’s best intentions end in disaster. But not always.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/the-spin-tms-test-cricket-addict\">The Spin | TMS: the key to being a functioning Test cricket addict | Andy Bull</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Paul Farbrace, England’s assistant coach, briefly found himself in this role while on a recent working holiday on the continent. “I thought I would have to be a bit of a matchmaker in Spain, said Farbrace at an event for Ashes sponsors Hardys of the time when Alastair Cook and Trevor Bayliss began to swap notes. “But actually they are such easy-going blokes that it was never going to be a difficult job. They genuinely do get on very well because they’re such down-to-earth people.” Currently it does not seem like a fleeting holiday romance. Back in this country it’s still going swimmingly.</p> \n<p>English cricket has been this way before – without the obvious use of a matchmaker. In 1999 Nasser Hussain and Duncan Fletcher would have struggled to recognise one another in the street. Yet they were thrown together as captain and coach at the end of a calamitous summer and the relationship worked from the start. It seems that Cook and Bayliss are also getting along fine (though <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/england-win-ashes-opener-as-stuart-broad-breaks-australias-top-order\" title=\"\">a 169-run victory</a> over Australia probably works even better than a shared bottle of the finest champagne when breaking the ice).</p> \n<p>Farbrace, still in the Cilla Black role, offers further confirmation: “Cookie and Trev actually complement one another nicely. Trev is positive in everything he does even if he doesn’t necessarily appear that way. He’s someone who wants the game to move forward at pace – and I think he’ll give Cookie a decent nudge along the way. The two of them have started really well together, right from Spain. There was obviously some hesitancy going there. What Trevor did really well was that he fitted into what we’d been doing as opposed to everyone else having to try to fit into him. He isn’t that sort of bloke. He’ll do his work quietly and pick people off one at a time.”</p> \n<p>At first glance and from the glowing references that everyone delivers about Bayliss, he is “the anti-coach coach”. This must be one reason why even Shane Warne rates him so highly.</p> \n<p>Cricket teams run best when the captain is obviously in charge with the coach helping, prodding and picking up the pieces wherever necessary. That was how Fletcher worked; it was also the pattern when Andy Flower began with Andrew Strauss. The coach’s input might be all-encompassing yet it often remained clandestine.</p> \n<p>Farbrace, who was qualified for the matchmaker’s role because he knows Bayliss so well from his time as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/apr/24/paul-farbrace-england-sri-lanka-peter-moores\" title=\"\">his assistant with Sri Lanka</a>, explains how Strauss, England’s new cricket director, was adamant the captain should impose himself at the start of the summer. “In the New Zealand series Straussy was very keen that none of the support staff should try to be the head coach. It was Cooky to run the show and he did that really well. He [Cook] said he wanted us to stop talking about scrapping and fighting and take that as a given. It was now time to show our skills, for the players to express themselves and enjoy playing for England, to play with a bit of freedom.”</p> \n<p>Captains often say stuff like that. It’s quite rare for it to actually come to pass out on the field, which was the case in Cardiff. There a few cagey onlookers were saying of Cook’s side in their second innings: “OK, a bit of freedom is fine but not total abandon, please.”</p> \n<p>Farbrace confirms that Bayliss wants his teams “to fight fire with fire” despite the Australian’s impenetrable, almost passive demeanour. “His calmness is his biggest thing”, says Farbrace. “In the winter after a tight match for the Sydney Sixers I saw Brad Haddin the next day and said to him: ‘Trev was looking really excited yesterday in the dugout – he actually pushed his glasses up his nose at one point.’”</p> \n<p>So it may not be an overtly passionate affair between Bayliss and Cook and the rest of the England players, but the relationship seems to be working rather well so far. If Farbrace really was a matchmaker he can puff his chest out with pride. But he denies much input to the Bayliss acquisition: “I’d love to take all the credit, but I can’t really. Apart from putting them in touch right at the start of the process I had no involvement whatsoever.”</p> \n<p>At the moment Bayliss may be the only Australian in this country purring about how the series is going. His opposite number, Darren Lehmann, has some decisions to ponder, principally whether to stick with Shane Watson at six or to replace him with Mitchell Marsh. Lehmann can also do blunt common sense: “We are not going to panic. Our lead-in was perfect for that Cardiff pitch – with the West Indies slow and then two tour games on slow pitches – so I can’t complain about that. The simple fact is they outplayed us and we didn’t play as we can.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436884442375/Englands-head-coach-Trevo-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's head coach Trevor Bayliss, left, in conversation with captain Alastair Cook and assistant Paul Farbrace during a training session.

My recollection is that it failed to resonate quite as much in this country although Scott McKenzie took John Phillips’ song about going to San Francisco to the top of the charts. There was the odd flower stuck in the top of a guardsman’s rifle outside Buckingham Palace, the Beatles did All You Need Is Love and there was Carnaby Street, psychedelia and Procul Harum. But there was also Engelbert Humperdinck topping the lot, so it all seemed a bit bandwagoning.</p> \n<p>Beyond that, life went on as usual. For cricket supporters the Indian and Pakistan cricket teams came, Geoffrey Boycott made 246 at Leeds and was dropped and I do not recall Ken Higgs wearing flowers in his hair.</p> \n<p>This year seems to be cricket’s summer of love, though, the one where the game began to rediscover its soul. It started on the other side of the world, in New Zealand, where Brendon McCullum and his team followed a full and frank assessment of what the game meant to them and why they were playing it by actually changing their ethos.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/defeated-australia-snubbed-offer-of-beer-with-england\">Defeated Australia snubbed offer of post-Ashes Test beer with England</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>At this point it needs to be remembered that McCullum has been no saint during his career, which makes the transformation all the more praiseworthy. If some found it disarming (Brad Haddin, for instance, said he found them so “nice” that he vowed not to get sucked in again, as he saw it), then it was a pleasure to see, helped his country rediscover a love for the game and made McCullum a revered figure to rank alongside the All Blacks captain, Richie McCaw. Haddin, incidentally, thinks Australia won the World Cup – beating New Zealand in the final – because they reverted to “the Australian way”, which is nonsense. They won because they were the better team.</p> \n<p>Then the Black Caps came to England, encountered an emerging young side keen to develop their own character along the same lines of hard, aggressive vibrant cricket sitting alongside the sheer pleasure of playing, chivalry and sportsmanship and together they produced such a compelling couple of months that it transformed the public perception not just of how England played cricket but how the game at all levels should and could be played. When New Zealand returned home I wrote that I thought the tour might come to be viewed as one of the most important ever and I stand by that.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2015/jul/14/ashes-first-test-england-v-australia-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Now the first Test against Australia</a> appears to have passed without rancour or particularly bad feeling beyond a couple of bits of gamesmanship, certainly none that would be apparent to anyone beyond those who are privy to stump mic conversations. Jimmy Anderson, who has been in the vanguard of any England verbal assaults in the past, looks to have cleaned up his act without diminishing his bowling and the manner in which Australia were outplayed would have served to quieten them down too. It is a characteristic of the bullying that is gratuitous sledging that it disappears when a side is not on top. So the game passed as peacefully as we might optimistically expect from such encounters.</p> \n<p>Well, until the aftermath that is. Convention has always dictated that the two teams share a drink at the close of a series but there was a time when it was the thing to do after each match. Certainly it is only in the last decade that the Australian team stopped this. They were invited to share a beer with the England team in Cardiff, something Alastair Cook’s side had done after each match with the New Zealanders, but it was turned down now. Speaking at the start of this week, Anderson put this into the public domain – mischievously or otherwise, only he knows – and somehow it has become an “issue”.</p> \n<p>Personally I think it a shame if two teams cannot leave any enmity on the field and get together. My own experience of international cricket is limited but I seem to recall spending time with West Indies players, not so much with India in their country, but I certainly did in Australia. In particular it was from sessions in the underground dressing rooms at the MCG that I came to know Dennis Lillee, Greg Chappell and Rod Marsh, all of whom remain friends now and who were happy to share information then, such as Lillee taking the time to show me how he bowled a leg cutter (I never got the hang of it). Those were times to be treasured.</p> \n<p>But just because a game has been played in the right spirit does not mean that the teams have to socialise if they do not wish. Sometimes it can be hard to do so in any case: Keith Fletcher, for example, has said he found it difficult in Australia to share a beer with people who had been trying to kill him for the previous six hours. And it is never easy to be really generous of spirit if you have been well beaten.</p> \n<p>There is also the idea that this is but a single Test of five and that this represents ongoing business. As an analogy, I do not think you would expect to see Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer having a natter over an energy drink between sets. So I do not regard the Australian stance as a snub, a slight or churlish. It is a choice. The offer was made in good faith and declined equally so.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436886069597/Jimmy-Anderson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England bowler Jimmy Anderson celebrates taking the wicket of David Warner during the first Test in Cardiff.

It transpired soon afterwards that he would miss the match, with confirmation coming via a CA press release.</p> \n<p>“I can confirm that Brad Haddin has withdrawn himself from the second Test at Lord’s for family reasons,” the team’s media manager, Kate Hutchison, said. “He will remain with the team in London and we won’t be making any further comment.Peter Nevill will replace him in the side.”</p> \n<p>Nevill, uncapped in any international format, is also Haddin’s understudy for New South Wales and has a fine first-class record with a batting average of more than 44, including a double-century.</p> \n<p>Haddin, like many of his compatriots, had a tough match in the first Test at Cardiff, where England were in charge almost throughout on their way to a 169-run victory. But he was the scourge of England in their 2013-14 Ashes whitewash defeat, topping Australia’s batting averages with five half-centuries, including a top score of 118.</p> \n<p>Haddin could make only 29 runs across the two innings in Cardiff and it may be that Nevill has been brought in for his batting as much as his wicketkeeping, having averaged 76 in the recent Sheffield Shield season.</p> \n<p>There was better news for Australia in that their paceman Mitchell Starc, who has been suffering from an ankle injury, looks like being fit for Lord’s, according to his potential replacement Peter Siddle.</p> \n<p>“Starcy got through well today, bowled out in the middle off the long run, both ends; he’s feeling good,” Siddle said. “I guess it’s just a waiting game at the moment for myself. Everyone’s fit which is nice.”</p> \n<p>There were problems, meanwhile, before the pending one-day series which follows the Tests when Australia announced that James Faulkner would not be considered for selection after being charged with drink-driving.</p> \n<p>The 25-year-old World Cup-winning all-rounder was charged this month, during a stint with Lancashire, and <a href=\"http://www.cricket.com.au/news/james-faulkner-suspended-by-cricket-australia-after-drink-driving-offence-in-the-uk/2015-07-14\" title=\"\">Australia put out a statement</a> on Tuesday which read: “Cricket Australia has charged all-rounder James Faulkner with a level-three offence under its code of behaviour, after he was found to have been drink-driving in the United Kingdom.</p> \n<p>“Faulkner has been charged under the code for conduct that is unbecoming of a representative and that is or could be harmful to the interests of cricket.”</p> \n<p>Faulkner has received four suspension points, which will effectively rule him out of a one-day international against Ireland at the end of next month and then the first three of five against England.</p> \n<p>The statement added: “Given he will be unavailable for a significant component of that series, Faulkner will not be considered for the Australian T20 or ODI squad when it is announced in mid-August. He may be considered as a replacement for an injured player following his suspension if required.</p> \n<p>“Faulkner will also have to undergo an alcohol management counselling programme, as determined by the Cricket Australia chief medical officer, and pay for any damage to property caused by his actions while driving.</p> \n<p>“He has also been formally reprimanded by Cricket Australia for his behaviour.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/53b46607b1064f31f539c6f52997df414e123052/0_161_2287_1372/2287.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1372,"width":2287,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ryan Pierse/Getty Images","altText":"Brad Haddin, right, is closeted with the Australian coach Darren Lehmann during their nets session at Lord’s","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T18:15:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T20:43:13Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Guardian sport","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/guardian-sport"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Brad Haddin","Australia cricket team","England cricket team","Ashes 2015","The Ashes","Cricket","Sport","Australia sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/brad-haddin","webTitle":"Brad Haddin"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"},{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/ashes","webTitle":"The Ashes"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Guardian sport","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/guardian-sport"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/brad-haddin-left-out-australia-second-test-lords","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ajpk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/14/brad-haddin-left-out-australia-second-test-lords","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/14/brad-haddin-left-out-australia-second-test-lords"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/53b46607b1064f31f539c6f52997df414e123052/0_0_2287_1535/2287.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1535,"width":2287,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Brad Haddin, right, is closeted with the Australian coach, Darren Lehmann, in the pavilion during the side’s nets session at Lord’s.

However, Siddle said that he expected Clarke to go on refusing the offer for the rest of the series.</p> \n<p>“We were invited in. It’s my fifth Ashes series and it’s the first time anyone has ever gone to have a drink after one Test match,” he said. “Like I said, I’ve played four Ashes series and we’ve never had a drink after a Test match until the very last one. I don’t think anything is going to change here.”</p> \n<p>The England opener Adam Lyth said they would continue to make the offer, win or lose. “It would have been nice to have them in to share a beer but it’s up to them,” he said. “The door will be open here, and I’m sure that even if we get beaten here we will be knocking on their door with a few beers, but it’s their choice.”</p> \n<p>Both sides shared a drink after every Test of the 2005 series, but the then captain, Ricky Ponting, put paid to the tradition – believing that the off-field camaraderie had contributed to their defeat. Since then, the two sides have socialised only after the final Test.</p> \n<p>Anderson had said on Monday that the players had revived the tradition during the visit of New Zealand and both sides had enjoyed it.</p> \n<p>“After the New Zealand series, we had a beer after each game with them. We found that was quite an enjoyable thing, just to chew the fat after a hard Test. It didn’t matter whether we won or lost,” he said.</p> \n<p>“It’s Cooky’s idea. He’s the captain, he went and asked them. We were all happy to do it. I don’t know why they didn’t come&nbsp;in.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/14/1436899120402/Peter-Siddle-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Peter Siddle revealed that Australia would decline any offers of a post-match beer with England until after the final Ashes Test and that Jimmy Anderson 'can't stand' the practice anyway.

A six-foot tall blond-haired Australian with boundless natural talent, a shirt-busting body and the willpower to bend a match with both bat and ball: this man should have inherited the cricketing earth. Alan Davidson, Richie Benaud, Steve Waugh: in the early years the greats of the local game were queueing up to hail Watto as the next messiah of Australian cricket, a homegrown all-rounder balm to our post-Freddie blues. But we all know what happened next: <a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fYjaUdWkAt8/UhqnPYCl86I/AAAAAAAAniQ/JGEgk-qkyP8/s640/Shane+Watson+2.jpg\">the nude calendar work</a>, the frightened night in Brett Lee’s bedroom after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2014/jul/22/the-joy-of-six-sports-ghost-stories\">seeing a ghost in Durham</a>, <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/australia/content/story/265573.html\">the heart attack that turned out to be diarrhoea</a>. </p> \n<p>There was the memoir, Watto, released mid-career at the age of 30 before anything meaningful had been achieved. There were the injuries, many of them, dwarfed only in number by the jokes they spawned. Say what you want about Watto as a batsman, there can be little doubt he had the full range of pulls, nicks and nudges – all of them played from within the confines of his own hamstrings. There was the rejigged bowling action, the move away from weights and the embrace of pilates, the move up the order then back down the order, the constant debate – a national obsession – over whether Watto would be able to keep galloping in like an athletic fridge to send down those monotonous, clumping, sometimes successful looseners. </p> \n<p>But above all, as the selectors have continued to indulge Watson’s long decade of potential, there has been the sense of a player who has steadfastly refused to play the part of the golden child that was thrust upon him from the start. Former coach Mickey Arthur claimed Michael Clarke considered Watson a “cancer on the team”, and as Watto’s booming potential has faded to a squeak, it’s been difficult to shift the images that entrench Watto’s status as an outcast: the hands in the pockets at slip, the forced banter with Clarke and Haddin in between deliveries, the sense, even through Australia’s post-Ashes celebrations in early 2014, that he was only pretending to enjoy himself. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a1799adb535f55f93283cb9d6b637029709eaf8d\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a1799adb535f55f93283cb9d6b637029709eaf8d/0_596_3425_1504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson departs after being dismissed in that most-familiar of ways – leg before – in the second innings of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"439\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson departs after being dismissed in that most-familiar of ways – leg before – in the second innings of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ryan Pierse/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is why we should not cry for Watto. Nor should we decry him. Don’t rue the wasted potential, or the frazzled aggression, or the promising starts thrown carelessly away. Give Watto instead the place he deserves in Australian cricket’s rich tradition of outcasts – men who played the game at the highest level, sometimes even with distinction, but somehow never quite fitted in. There are two broad character types that run through the history of Australian cricket: the rebel-larrikins and the brooders. Keith Miller, Neil Harvey, Ian Chappell, Dennis Lillee, Rod Marsh, Merv Hughes, Shane Warne, Ian Healy, Ricky Ponting – these are the type of gregarious, expressive, hot-tempered, hard-drinking cricketers Australia likes. </p> \n<p>But the greats of the 1970s – when our cricketing larrikinism was arguably in its pomp – famously detested Australia’s greatest player of all. Don Bradman was everything Chappell and his cohort were not: remote, spiky, formal, perhaps even a touch intellectual. These qualities made life difficult for Bradman during his playing career, but his supreme talent trumped all.</p> \n<p>In the decades since, however, Bradman has emerged as a kind of spirit father to Australian cricket’s other story: the story of the non-conformists, the dressing room oddballs, the nearly-theres and the not-quite-evers. Several have followed in this less heralded personality mould. Stuart MacGill was so eccentric he drank wine; this, combined with his difficult, over-thinker’s character, made him a marginal presence in the Australian dressing room even in those moments when his career-long deputisation for Shane Warne was at its peak of success. </p> \n<p>Simon Katich played with the neurotic, scratchy intensity of a post-punk frontman. At times throughout his career it was like watching David Byrne open the batting, his strokeplay a concatenation of yelps and squeaks through midwicket. He also gave good brood, as Clarke discovered one night via <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-07-17/history-of-tension-in-australian-cricket-team/4824926\">the application of a Katich hand to his throat</a>. Kim Hughes resigned the national captaincy in tears because, essentially, Lillee and Marsh bullied him out of the job. It was great TV, and even better brooding. Ashley Mallett was Australia’s most successful offspinner until Nathan Lyon, but his contribution has arguably been overlooked amid the fallout of an epic personality clash with the rebel-larrikin and beloved Channel Nine commentator Bill Lawry. The brooder and the hooter: in history’s eyes, only one was going to win.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/australia-dads-army-darren-lehmann-england-ashes\">Australia’s Dad’s Army under fire but Darren Lehmann says don’t panic | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What makes Watson so special among this broody group is that, in contrast to many of the others, he looked the part of an all-Australian great. Most of the leading brooders were unlikely athletes: Bradman, Katich, MacGill. But Watto was different. Watto was tall. Watto was strong. Watto was handsome. Watto married a person off TV. Everything about the man, physically, had set him up for success. Perhaps part of the national envenomation towards Watson over the past few days comes from the misery of jilted expectations.</p> \n<p>As a player, Watson never quite figured himself out. At the beginning of his career, he was known more for his bowling than his batting; in the frenzy of Cricket Australia’s post-2005 search for an answer to Andrew Flintoff, he became the solution to The All-Rounder Riddle; later he became a specialist opening batsman, in both forms of the game; then he was tasked with filling the Test team’s Ponting-sized hole at number three. On this Ashes tour, Watson has been preferred as a middle-order batsman over Mitchell Marsh, essentially, on the strength of his bowling. The thinking around how to play Watson has been some of the knottiest, most complex intellectual work produced in Australia this century. </p> \n<p>In sympathy with these sudden, jolting shifts across the spectrum of play, Watson’s management of his own body has been, perhaps inevitably, similarly confused: bulky one day, lissom the next, he’s never hit on the best strategy to tune his frame – this fragile tuba – to its optimal pitch. It’s almost as if the man, having tested seemingly every position in the batting lineup and experimented with wildly divergent styles of bowling and muscular conditioning, has ended up estranged from himself. He’s become a stranger to his own physique. </p> \n<p>In the process, he’s also become a stranger to the Australian dressing room. One of the most illuminating passages in Watto, his 2011 memoir, is where Watson describes his awkward teenage years:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p>“I never went to parties in high school because I always had cricket the next day, and I never used to smoke pot like everyone else. I loved playing cricket and I wasn’t interested in anything that might interfere with that. As for girls, when I was at school I suppose I was always a bit of a nerd in a way. We weren’t that well-off and I never had all the new fashions. Also, whatever my dad wore, I thought was cool. I guess I was an under-achiever on the social side.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This is the credo of the outsider, and that sense of Watto as a liminal presence, despite his physical immensity, has carried over into his place within the national cricketing consciousness. Always wasting the review, a “cancer on the team”, Watto has never truly appeared to be a friend to many in the Australian dressing room. </p> \n<p>Fidgety and watchful, Watson would have made a great Camusian anti-hero. Elsewhere in Watto he explains his reason for pursuing a career in cricket: “I wanted to do something so that people knew I existed.” Making it big in cricket was Watto’s answer to shooting the Arab on the beach. He could have been Australian cricket’s Meursault, a cult legend of affectless indifference and self-estrangement, a kind of Dougie Walters without the tinny and the smile. But to pull the act off, Watto would have had to stop caring. And Watto could never do apathy. The one thing everyone agrees on about Watto is that he cares – too much.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c3562bbc4ca2442c8d01fe6e620b74c4be4052aa\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c3562bbc4ca2442c8d01fe6e620b74c4be4052aa/0_0_3525_2249/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Watson, pictured in the slips with captain Michael Clarke and Steve Smith during the first Test in Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"638\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Watson, pictured in the slips with captain Michael Clarke and Steve Smith during the first Test in Cardiff.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Brown/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When I was eight, and still dreaming of a career in the baggy green, I would burst into tears whenever I got out. Fortunately, I outgrow the habit by the age of 10. Watto, even at the age of 34, greets every dismissal as if still in the throes of that impending juvenile trauma. He bristles with purpose, but it’s a purpose with no team solidarity; his sporting will is entirely self-centred. This is no criticism. It only reinforces the sense of Watson, assertive but insular, as a richly textured character, his career so layered with missed chances, what-ifs, self-pity and regret, it should really be set to music – perhaps the swampy and disorienting exoticism of Brahms’s Double Concerto or the twilight zone yowl of David Bowie’s I’m Deranged. </p> \n<p>But Watson is not alone, and that’s the point. Katich, MacGill, Hughes and many others have all walked this path before him – a path of lush neurosis and wistful melancholy. As the curtain comes down on this decade-long farce of food poisoning and back pain, the lingering image of Watson will be of the golden boy staring glumly from his tower, trapped in the prison of his own immaculate physique. </p> \n<p>But in time we will see that this was a career fully lived, filled with volatility but somehow so densely predictable in its non-deviation from a mid-30s batting average. In time we will understand Watto not as a beautiful disaster but as the last and most beguiling of the baggy green brooders, these saturnine loners whose guiding athletic purpose has been to supply the minor mode to Australian cricket’s major scale, to live and play – thriving only some of the time – in the shadows on the other side of the mountain. </p> \n<p>Good night, sweet Watto. We thought we loved you, once.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/66728d955c1860123e47b05925a20dd2186e6b7d/0_28_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gareth Copley/Getty Images","altText":"“The thinking around how to play Watson has been some of the knottiest, most complex intellectual work produced in Australia this century.”","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a1799adb535f55f93283cb9d6b637029709eaf8d/0_596_3425_1504/3425.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1504,"width":3425,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Watson departs after being dismissed in that most-familiar of ways – leg before – in the second innings of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.
