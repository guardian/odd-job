We will monitor him over the next few days but the plan is for him to take part in some light training and we are hopeful he will be available for selection for the second Test”</p> \n<p>On their XI for Lord’s Darren Lehmann, the Australia head coach, admitted Watson’s two dismissals in Cardiff – both lbw – were a cause for concern and that his fellow all-rounder, Mitchell Marsh, was pushing hard following centuries in both of their tour warm-ups. Asked about Watson’s leg-before issues, Lehmann replied: “He’ll be disappointed with that and so are we. [Marsh] is very close. So it’s going to be a tight call leading into the second Test.”</p> \n<p>Lehmann also reiterated his frustration at the slow pitch in Cardiff, which tempered the threat of Mitchell Johnson, but he is not expecting much improvement at Lord’s. “Everyone talks about it – yes, we’d love a bit more pace,” he added. “That would be good but we’re not going to get it, so there’s no point asking.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/ashes-australia-second-test-lords\">Australia won’t whinge on the surface, but all eyes are on Lord’s pitch</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/12/1436716788645/England---Trevor-Bayliss--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England head coach, Trevor Bayliss, has warned his side that Australia will have a point to prove in the second Test at Lord's.

His first innings’ 20 featuring two uncharacteristic and unsuccessful attempts to charge the spinner Nathan Lyon and his second ended on 12 with an expansive drive off Mitchell Starc that flew to backward point.</p> \n<p>But Bayliss preaches self-determination by his players - he calls them the current custodians of the game because the coaches “have had their chance out in the middle” - and therefore has no issue with Cook trying to lead by example when he sees fit.</p> \n<p>“Cook is a calm operator and very well respected by the players in the team,” said Bayliss. “He is obviously a fantastic batsman. I thought his approach in the first innings – even though he only got 20 – sent a bit of a message to the rest of the players. Most of the good captains around are not only leaders of the team but they lead the way in their attitude.”</p> \n<p>“My message to Alastair Cook is to go out and play his own way,” he added. “Yes, we were talking as a group about being mentally aggressive, not necessarily trying to whack sixes and fours. But if you are mentally aggressive those boundary balls – when they do come along your feet are moving and you put them away.</p> \n<p>“Sometimes that message can take a little bit of time to sink in, I suppose. Certainly people like Alastair and Ian Bell have scored plenty of Test hundreds. My advice to them would be to go out and bat like you always have done. Those two guys are class players and can change their game to suit any situation. The rest of the guys can bat around them.”</p> \n<p>Another feature of Bayliss’ early impact – aside from the near-flawless display in the field – was the bowling of Moeen Ali, who credited the 52-year-old with encouraging him to try his variations and returned with five wickets in the series opener. For Bayliss, the reasoning is simple.</p> \n<p>“Against the Australians, if you are bowling straight, they will make you pay,” said Bayliss. “If you&nbsp;can get the ball to move in different directions obviously any&nbsp;batter has to make a decision, and&nbsp;when a batter has to make a decision that’s when a mistake can happen.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436722826384/Alastair-Cook-Moeen-Ali-E-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Alastair Cook, centre, and Moeen Ali celebrate the dismissal of David Warner in the second innings of the first Test against Australia.

Cate McGregor echoes this, describing a “bold new England”. It is left to Gideon Haigh to mull over where it all went wrong for the Aussies, noting that this was a defeat “30 months in the making” and criticising David Warner for his uncharacteristically unsure performance.</p> \n<p>Fox Sports <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/fox-cricket-podcast-england-dominant-australia-subservient/story-e6frf3gl-1227438655773\">have little time for Australia’s bluster</a> about “playing their natural game”.</p> \n<p>“Let’s hope they keep that natural game up, because I think we’ll win 5-0 if that happens,” says Derek Pringle, with Stuart MacGill adding: “‘Natural game is a smoke screen that’s put up by people that really haven’t come to terms with the truth.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/the-ashes/the-ashes-2015-steve-smith-not-the-worlds-best-clarke-out-captained-by-cook-writes-pringle/story-e6frf3gl-1227438675023\">In a separate column, Pringle joins Boycott</a> in praising Alastair Cook, saying: “Clarke had one of his least funky games as the world’s funkiest captain, being outshone by Alastair Cook at almost every turn.”</p> \n<p>He is also withering in his assessment of Steve Smith. “Smith came into the series being lauded by his countrymen as the greatest batsman currently in world cricket.

If they do it will sound as if they are whingeing. And by and large the Aussies do not approve of whingeing.</p> \n<p>Darren Lehmann expressed some disappointment about the slowness of the surface in Cardiff during the Test match but Australia’s reaction had to be more guarded afterwards. They could say nothing other than that they had been thoroughly outplayed in all departments, an observation readily acknowledged by Michael Clarke amid the debris of defeat.</p> \n<p>However, the nature of the pitches for the remainder of the series will be occupying their minds. At Cardiff the surface suited England nicely. The bouncer was negated and this was a significant part of Australia’s armoury when England were thrashed there 18 months ago. In some ways that tour was a throwback because fear was so obviously a factor again. The lower half of England’s batting order was – let’s be polite – “apprehensive” about facing Mitchell Johnson. The top half was none too enthusiastic either.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/england-australia-ashes-cardiff-compare\">How England and Australia compared in the first Ashes Test at Cardiff</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Here is one England batsman’s recollection of the prospect of facing Johnson straight after lunch in that series – with the odd expletive deleted. “Lunch? No thanks. I was sitting there thinking: I could die here in the Gabbatoir.” Our witness then implored Mushtaq Ahmed to accompany him to the indoor nets and to hurl a wet tennis ball at his head by way of preparation.</p> \n<p>“Then I walked out for my first ball. I had been petrified: if Trotty can get played like that there is no hope for me.” Thus wrote Kevin Pietersen in a recent autobiography that may have escaped your attention – and, relatively speaking, he played Johnson pretty well on that tour. Then the ball was whistling through at shoulder height two or three times an over, forever bringing to mind the refrain of Lance Corporal Jones in Dad’s Army. But in Cardiff a bouncer was almost as rare as an MP yelling “mea culpa” from the dispatch box. A few were propelled in the direction of Stuart Broad but he survived them unlike two of the three deliveries he received from the off-spinner, Nathan Lyon, in the Test match (as an old member of the off-spinning union there is bemusement at this sudden philanthropy towards finger-spinners).</p> \n<p>Fear is not the only factor. With the bouncer almost taken out of the equation the batsmen can adopt a slightly different technique. There is no longer the inclination to lodge on the back foot to avoid the lifting delivery. Hence against the swinging ball, which is the greatest weapon of Mitchell Starc, there is the confidence to move forward to be in a good position to drive full-length deliveries. England’s batsmen were never shy of driving the ball against Starc or Johnson in Cardiff and they had an unusually high ratio of opportunities.</p> \n<p>So the intriguing question is what sort of pitch will be produced at Lord’s. Lehmann is almost resigned to another slow one. “I’d just like to see you be able to bowl a bouncer on day one. That’d be nice.” Johnson and Starc – if he is fit – might say “Amen to that”.</p> \n<p>Certainly antipodean conspiracy theorists will have more meat to chew on if the Lord’s pitch is not very green and not very fast. Down in Cardiff we witnessed the sort of surface that has been commonplace on that square for the past few decades.</p> \n<p>As it happens it produced a very fine Test match. Wickets fell – rather more quickly than anticipated – to all types of bowlers. Runs flowed at a rate around four per over. Only those with tickets for the final day felt in the least bit short-changed. Hence there can be no complaints.</p> \n<p>However, we know that there is a little more flexibility at Lord’s. Examine the last three Tests there: in June 2014 there was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jun/16/england-sri-lanka-review-first-test-nuwan-pradeep\" title=\"\">an exciting draw against Sri Lanka</a> even though the pitch, which soon acquired a dull brown colour, lacked pace. In July 2014 the players were greeted, according to Wisden, by “the greenest surface served up at Lord’s in living memory – at the start it was hard to distinguish the pitch from the playing area”. England did not play frightfully well <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/21/england-v-india-second-test-day-five-live\" title=\"\">and lost to India by 95 runs</a>.</p> \n<p>In May of this year there was also some green grass on the pitch, which ensures more pace, and this was enough to persuade New Zealand’s Brendon McCullum to bowl first. England, despite a first-innings deficit of 134, ended up <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/may/25/england-new-zealand-first-test-day-five-live\" title=\"\">winning a thrilling encounter by 124 runs</a>.</p> \n<p>At the time everyone reached for superlatives to describe a pacy track, which had enabled five days of dazzling cricket. The point is that at Lord’s, perhaps unlike Cardiff, there is the expertise and the scope to produce a variety of pitches.</p> \n<p>We can be sure that this week’s Test pitch will not be greener than the one that greeted MS Dhoni and his India team 12 months ago, but there is still room for much fevered speculation about what will be unveiled by Mick Hunt, the immensely skilful and experienced Lord’s head groundsman, on Thursday morning.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436712155426/Mitchell-Johnson-cut-a-de-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mitchell Johnson cut a dejected figure as the slow pitch in Cardiff removed much of his menace.

There were, to use one of cricketers’ favourite maxims, positives to be taken, even in failure: Alastair Cook was sharply snaffled by Brad Haddin off the bowling of Nathan Lyon, but his positive intent in looking to attack a spinner whose bowling had been plundered by county sides in the warm-up matches was the right approach. OK, a cut against a top-spinning delivery with a hard bouncy ball might not have been the wisest shot, but it set the tone for England’s attitude throughout the match.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/12/england-joe-root-australia-bowlers-ashes\">England’s Joe Root leaves Australia’s bowlers with no margin for error | Jason Gillespie</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>An enormous amount of credit has to go to Joe Root, who came in with England on the brink of a collapse at 43 for three, promptly nicked his second ball to Haddin and was relieved to see the wicketkeeper spill an easy-ish chance. For Root to then hit 134 at a strike-rate of 80 showed remarkable nerve. The same can be said of Ian Bell’s second-innings 60; with critics questioning his place in the side, Bell’s eagerness to play those gorgeous cover drives and whipped pull shots – to the tune of 11 boundaries – was brave stuff.</p> \n<p>Australia’s run-rate was slightly below England’s across the match, but that was largely down to a superior bowling effort from the home side. While they looked to play expansive shots, only Chris Rogers and Mitchell Johnson made innings of any substance with a strike-rate above 61, the latter after the game was lost. Twelve of the Australian wickets to fall came from batsmen looking to drive aggressively or dancing down the wicket. For all Australia’s experience, it was England’s heads that were wiser when it came to shot selection. Haddin, looking to smash Moeen Ali over the top of mid on with the game needing to be saved on day four, epitomised the brainless aspect of their batting, while Michael Clarke’s tentative prod to point earlier in the day showcased their tentative thinking.</p> \n<h2>Bowling</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c1744dbc7e1ec6c8fee9673e7eb7bd17baf09cf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436713222777/7089809d-8f4a-42bb-a7aa-1624fcafa261-460x256.jpeg\" alt=\"England's Moeen Ali bowls at Australia's Mitchell Starc in the first Test.\" width=\"460\" height=\"256\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Moeen Ali bowls at Australia’s Mitchell Starc in the first Test.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Brown/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Many observers pointed to Mitchell Starc’s ankle injury as one of the main reasons for England’s batmen’s dominance of the Australian bowling; however, this is something of a red herring. After all, Starc only appeared to be in discomfort in his follow-through – his approach to the crease and delivery stride did not seem to be particularly affected – and he often clocked 90mph plus. Sure, he was a touch wayward at times, but his match figures of seven for 174 were the best of any bowler in the match and his second innings economy rate of 3.75 was the best of Australia’s seamers.</p> \n<p>It is more instructive to look at the performances of the two sides’ third seamers. Johnson, who bowled first change in the first innings, was not at his 2009-11 nadir by any stretch of the imagination, but his innings figures of 0-111 were his worst in Tests. At one stage, the England fans felt confident enough to reprise the “he bowls it to the left, he bowls it to the right” chant that the paceman must have thought he’d put to bed when terrifying batsmen in the 2013-14 series. He leaked 4.38 runs an over across the match and rarely discomforted any of England’s top order.</p> \n<p>Mark Wood, in contrast, played his supporting role to perfection. He bowled at a similar pace to Johnson but his line and length were far better and, as a result, so was his economy rate. He picked up two wickets in each innings, including that of Rogers on 95 in the first, helping to ensure that Australia’s batsmen were unable to make good on strong starts. Wood was impressive, if slightly wayward, in his debut series against New Zealand earlier this year but he improved quickly in Cardiff and in just his third Test already looks a perfect fit in the team; he echoes Simon Jones’ role in 2005 to Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson’s Steve Harmison and Andrew Flintoff.</p> \n<p>Australia arguably had the edge in the spin department, as you’d expect given that Nathan Lyon is their most successful ever off-spinner and Moeen remains a work in progress. However, that was the only edge the visitors had. Even with the bat, England’s bowlers came out on top. Australia’s tail wagged only when the game was lost, while England’s last three wickets scored a quick, confidence-boosting 87 runs in their first dig and 49 in the second.</p> \n<h2>Fielding</h2> \n<p>There were two drops in the match. Rogers was on four as Australia looked to overturn a massive deficit in the final innings; an edge presented a tough chance to second slip, where Root dived to his left and grassed it. Root was probably judged slightly more harshly for that drop only because he had held an identical chance in Australia’s first innings to oust Starc. As it was, Rogers didn’t make the most of his extra life, adding only six more runs.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/ashes-australia-second-test-lords\">Australia won’t whinge on the surface, but all eyes are on Lord’s pitch</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Root hadn’t yet scored when he nicked his second ball through to Haddin in England’s first innings. It was an easier chance than the one he would later spill as a fielder, but Haddin moved too early and the ball cannoned out of his gloves and down to earth. Root put on 134 more runs; England won the match by 169 of the things.</p> \n<p>Other than that (how did you enjoy the play, Mrs Lincoln?) Australia’s fielding was fine. They took their 12 other chances, including a couple of very fine ones by David Warner and Michael Clarke, and can hardly be blamed for the paucity of opportunities created by the bowlers. England, though, caught exceptionally, more like the 2010-11 vintage of fielding than that we had seen recently. Cook had a great Test in the field. There was a sharp catch at first slip off Warner in the first innings, good reactions to get the dangerous Smith soon after, an absolute screamer at silly mid on that did for Haddin in the second, and some fast reactions to set up a relay catch for Adam Lyth to break the frustrating eighth-wicket Johnson-Starc stand in the dying stages.</p> \n<p>Bell also deserves praise. His batting was not the only thing being called into question after the New Zealand series, in which he spilled a couple of chances at second slip while many were calling for him to return to his best position at short leg to allow Lyth to take his familiar Yorkshire place. Bell held two key catches in Australia’s second innings to precipitate their collapse.</p> \n<h2>Tactics</h2> \n<p>You had one captain whose stock is so high and whose reputation for innovation is such that a new term – “funky” – has been added to the cricket lexicon to describe it. You had his opposite number, who has come in for criticism from even the most staunch of ECB line-toers and who could only improve, so low was the esteem in which his cricketing brain is held. Yet everything Cook touched turned to gold, while Clarke cut a forlorn and hopeless figure in the outfield.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02590ee6d9f5d891d275925c4d9f60e2fa3f2d8d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436713350920/0db94c4c-0fbd-402f-bac7-8e968d8c8db9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alastair Cook enjoyed a fine game as captain.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alastair Cook enjoyed a fine game as captain.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Giddens/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Even before the match, it was 1-0 to Cook. He resisted calls to pick Adil Rashid, stuck to his Moeen-shaped guns and was rewarded with 92 runs and five crucial wickets. He kept faith with the out-of-form Gary Ballance, who put on 153 with Root in the first innings when England were in trouble. Clarke picked Shane Watson over the in-form Mitchell Marsh and was rewarded with not much at all. He gave Adam Voges an Ashes debut and got about the same from him.</p> \n<p>Cook’s field placings were unorthodox, to say the least. Two men at mid off in catching positions, liberal use of leg slip and, when Australia’s tail belatedly showed some fight, a silly third slip. Men surrounded the bat, kept the pressure on and the catches kept coming. Clarke made minor shuffles in the field and stood there waiting while England smacked the ball to the boundary and never once got bogged down. Australia bowled Starc into the ground, to the point that he is a doubt for the second Test, while Cook turned to Moeen at first change in the first innings. The spinner got smacked around, but then came back for a one-over spell that broke Warner’s resistance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/shane-watson-lbw-australia-england-first-test-ashes\">Shane Watson’s lbw weakness could force Australia to dismiss reputation | Mike Selvey</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even though Warner was the only player on either side to get a decision overturned on review, England won the DRS battle. The crucial moment came when Moeen was on 35 in England’s first innings. Hotspot showed that he had feathered Starc through to Haddin but Australia had barely appealed and didn’t consider the review. Moeen thumped his next ball for four and added 42 important further runs.</p> \n<p>As for Watson, let’s not rub it in any further.</p> \n<h2>Second Test preparation</h2> \n<p>England go into the second Test at Lord’s buoyed by a huge victory and a clean bill of health. They have named an unchanged 13-man squad, as expected, and it would surely take a midweek injury for them to even consider altering their XI. Their confidence will be further boosted by the news that, after the victory in Cardiff, Root has moved into the top five of the ICC’s Test batting rankings, Broad has done the same among the bowlers and Moeen has broken into the top 10 all-rounders.</p> \n<p>Australia, on the other hand, can no longer boast the official world’s best batsman, as Steve Smith has relinquished his status to AB de Villiers. More importantly, though, Starc remains an injury worry as he had cortisone injections in his ankle during the first Test, although Australia have said his condition has improved. If Starc misses out, then the likely replacement is Peter Siddle, who is bowling well this season, albeit in Division Two of the County Championship. The other alternative is Pat Cummins, who hasn’t played first class cricket in two years.</p> \n<p>Even more worrying for them is the form of their senior players: Clarke and Haddin are in dreadful nick, while Darren Lehmann has done little to suggest that Watson hasn’t played his last Test match.</p> \n<p>England have seen that Australia’s pacemen are far less intimidating on slow seaming pitches and are certain to ask Mick Hunt to prepare a similar surface at Lord’s. Australia’s best hope is that Hunt remains true to his stubborn nature and gives them something similar to the quick wicket we saw in the New Zealand series.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/12/1436709241412/England-v-Australia-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root celebrates the wicket of Mitchell Johnson as England coast to an Ashes win over Australia.
