Moeen Ali and Stuart Broad are set to resume on 26 and nought respectively, with Root calling on the pair to back up his hard work.</p> \n<p>“I’m really pleased with the way things have gone. I rode my luck at times, especially early on,” he said. “When they attack, that’s the best time to attack them because that’s where the gaps are. It’s not going to work every time but fortunately it did today. Hopefully it’s the first of a few and not just a one-off.”</p> \n<p>Root was described by Josh Hazlewood, who took three for 70, as England’s most improved player since the last time the sides met, a compliment that was well received by the right-hander who went on to credit being stood down for the fifth Test on the 2013-14 tour as the reason behind his current form.</p> \n<p>“That’s nice of him to say and it’s nice to get out there and get a big score, especially so early in the series, but we want to win back the Ashes and we have to back that up now. It’s going to be a really good contest and a really interesting series,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Getting dropped was a feeling I don’t want to go through again but in this sport you have to deal with hard times. It shows self-belief and self-confidence. I feel in a really good place at the minute. I just keep things as simple as possible and take the positive option when I can.”</p> \n<p>Asked who was in the ascendancy, Root replied: “It’s very hard to say, the very pleasing thing is we have got to this position and hopefully we can build on it in the morning. To look too far ahead would be silly. We are in the position we are, it’s important we get to 400 and past it if there is a chance to do so.”</p> \n<p>Root, following the early removals of Adam Lyth, Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, joined the No3 Gary Ballance at the crease, who shrugged off his own struggle for runs with a hard-fought 61. The Yorkshire pair combined for a stand of 153 that included a wicketless afternoon session and helped wrestle back control.</p> \n<p>“Gary’s innings was so important for us today – the mental strength he showed, the determination and the Yorkshire grit, if you like – the way he went about things was really pleasing,” Root said.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t pretty to watch at times but it was vital to us to get a decent position in the game. That’s why he’s so integral to our team and such an important part of our dressing room.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/joe-root-england-australia-ashes\">England centurion Joe Root exploits dressing-room insight of Mitchell Starc | Vic Marks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Despite all the talk about sledging, the on-field relations between the sides did not hit boiling point although Starc, who claimed three for 84, did give Ben Stokes a send-off, putting his finger to his lips, after clean bowling the all-rounder for 52.</p> \n<p>“I’m not too sure what that was about but Starcy got the last laugh,” Hazlewood said. “The way Root batted was pretty special. We’ll have to come back with a plan, or a couple of plans, to be able to nullify him over the rest of the series.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I was pretty nervous but excited and was happy with how I went; I think the game’s level. I think we were good in patches and if you put the ball in right area there was enough [assistance].”</p> \n<p>The Cardiff pitch attracted much criticism following the initial exchanges, with a number of deliveries bouncing twice before being taken by the wicketkeeper. The turgid surface negated the pace of Mitchell Johnson, the scourge of England in Australia 18 months ago, as he ended the opening day wicketless from his 20 overs.</p> \n<p>“Johnson is a fine bowler but we played him extremely well,” Root said. “You have you give credit to us. I’m sure there will be times in the series when he will bowl well and hopefully we can handle it as we did today.</p> \n<p>“It is a little bit slow, you see the first few balls not carry and think: ‘Oh God’. There might be variable bounce but if you bowl in the right areas and have good plans, that can be just as effective as lateral movement. Fingers crossed, we can start well with the new ball, get some breakthroughs and put them under pressure.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436387725424/Englands-Joe-Root-hits-ou-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root admitted he rode his luck but was able to make Australia suffer after being dropped second ball  on the opening day of the first Ashes Test.

One is Virat Kohli of India and a second, New Zealand’s unflappable run machine Kane Williamson, has already been seen here this summer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/alastair-cook-natural-game-england-australia\">Full marks for intent but Alastair Cook must play his natural game | Ali Martin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The other two are playing in the first Test in Cardiff. Of these Steve Smith will get his chance perhaps on the second day to show his remarkable progress from perceived clown to the top-ranked batsman in the world. For now, though, the rise and rise of Joe Root, the epitome of youthful exuberance, continues. Root, not yet 25 years old, is having the time of his life, in that state, unencumbered by theory and over-analysis, where batting becomes so easy that it must be hard for him to comprehend how difficult it can be for others.</p> \n<p>Dropped by Brad Haddin behind the wicket from the second ball he faced from Mitchell Starc, he made a sublime century, his second against Australia and the seventh of his Test career, that pulled England away from a tricky situation at 43 for three, and he was not to be dismissed until Starc returned for his sixth spell and with his first ball, angled across, had him well caught low down at first slip by Shane Watson.</p> \n<p>By then, though, he had made 134, hitting 17 fours in the process, most of them sweetly through extra cover. There was assistance. Gary Ballance, whose idiosyncratic technique will have been scrutinised by Australia and no doubt left them wondering how precisely he has managed to average in the mid-50s, weathered the early storm that saw the loss of Adam Lyth, in the second over of the day, and then Alastair Cook and Ian Bell immediately after the first drinks break.</p> \n<p>Ballance was to make 61 in three and three quarter hours during which he scarcely made a mistake until he was lbw to a full ball from the persevering Josh Hazlewood. But by then he and Root had added 153 for the fourth wicket, effectively wiping out the earlier setback.</p> \n<p>Later Ben Stokes arrived to play with freedom once again, making 52, with seven fours and two sixes, one a top-edged hook over fine-leg and the other straight from Lyons, before he was bowled by a beauty from Starc that pitched around middle and took off stump. “Sssh” Starc mimed, finger to lips, as Stokes grumped his way off: sound advice.</p> \n<p>These really are remarkable times for Root. From the start of play he had sat on the dressing room balcony, grinning away at the lark of it all. He watched as Lyth edged Hazlewood’s third ball low to David Warner in the gully, who took a sharp catch well – a good delivery that swung into the left-hander, prompting him to look legside, but then held off the pitch. Soon after, Cook, looking to be positive against Nathan Lyon’s offspin but unable to get away any of the 13 previous deliveries from him, looked for his favourite cut and edged behind.</p> \n<p>One run later and Bell all but had his feet knocked from beneath him by Starc’s yorker and was lbw, thus continuing a sorry run of Test match scores – 11, 1, 0, 0, 1, 29, 12, 1 and now 1 again – since he made 143 against West Indies in the first Test in Antigua back in April.</p> \n<p>If it was a ticklish first hour for England, who won the toss and had no hesitation in batting despite some overcast conditions and the occasional squally shower, then those who had taken their seats early expecting to see some fire and brimstone from the Australian pace attack would have been disappointed. Local knowledge had suggested that county pitches had been slow this season and this, devoid of grass, looks to be no exception.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/wales-ashes-first-test-ecb-glamorgan-england-australia\">Wales puts on a woolly welcome as ECB tries to feed the Glamorgan fire | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Haddin stood a long way back for Starc’s opening over, only to find two deliveries bouncing before they reached him. If the ball nibbled around a little and swung too, potentially taking the pitch out of the equation, then it would still have signalled a tough day for the bowlers, who could see the law of diminishing returns: the harder they flogged the ball into the pitch, the slower it came off it.</p> \n<p>It may suit skiddy bowlers more. Under the circumstances the Australians stuck to their task handsomely, the reward of three wickets apiece to Hazlewood and particularly Starc more than well-earned. The scoring rate throughout the day was admirable –in excess of four runs per over – but turgid, emasculating surfaces such as this do Test cricket few favours.</p> \n<p>By the close England had reached 343 for seven, a total with which they should be content but not more than that. The wicket of Jos Buttler, for 27, shortly before the close, as he hit Hazlewood tamely to mid-on, meant that Australia may well be the more satisfied of the two teams.</p> \n<p>The manner in which Starc and Hazlewood were able to adjust their length to the conditions, bowling fuller than they might habitually be used to, and risking being driven in the process, was exemplary and the ball was given the opportunity to swing as a result. Jimmy Anderson, in particular, will see encouragement in this but it promises to be just as hard for the England bowlers as their Australian counterparts.</p> \n<p>As it is, it will be down to Moeen Ali, who has batted calmly for his 26, and Stuart Broad to try to get England up to 400 and beyond. Broad, with great commonsense, and no little courage, turned down a long single in the final over in order to ensure Moeen survived and it will not have gone unnoticed: he can be sure of a working-over first thing, almost certainly from Mitchell Johnson.</p> \n<p>Slow pitch it might be but it is quick enough to make life uncomfortable, as Johnson, wicketless in the day, might well remind him. “And just wait ’til I get you on a quick ’un.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436382610372/Joe-Root-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root raises his bat to acknowledge the adoring support after his innings of 134 on day one of the Ashes in Cardiff.

On both occasions Root has been grateful to the Australia keeper for not putting his hands together more successfully earlier in his innings.</p> \n<p>At Lord’s two years ago Haddin and Michael Clarke glared at one another when Root on four edged a ball from Shane Watson between them. Root finished with 180, a second-innings knock which set up an emphatic England victory. This innings, which was more important still since it began with England wobbling ominously on 43 for three, was also dependent on Haddin missing a difficult chance – from Root’s second ball.</p> \n<p>Root had barely survived the previous delivery from Mitchell Starc. The lanky left-armer had just sent Ian Bell packing with a full-length inswinger. Root’s first ball jagged into the pads off the pitch, which is even trickier to combat. All the Australians opened their lungs; the umpire Marais Erasmus was unmoved; a review was considered but Root, the mischievous Root who has occasionally displayed the capacity to wind up Australians, was smiling. He knew the ball, one of Starc’s very best, had conveniently taken his inside edge before thudding into pads which were located bang in front of the stumps. The next one had Haddin sprawling to his right. Root was no longer smiling, nor was the wicketkeeper, nor Starc.</p> \n<p>The duel between Starc and Root was compelling. In that spell an hour into the game Starc was the most dangerous bowler on the pitch, swinging the ball late at pace. Stunned by his first two deliveries, Root reacted as England had promised – with aggression.</p> \n<p>In Starc’s next over Root took 11 runs from two silky drives and a back-foot punch and he was on his way. Root did not look overawed. This would probably have been the case if he had never come across Starc before. They shared a dressing room for Yorkshire twice in the County Championship in 2012. That usually helps to demystify an opponent.</p> \n<p>If you had met any Australian before this tour and asked about Starc he or she would have taken a sharp intake of breath and raised eyebrows before reminding you Starc had just taken the new ball from Mitchell Johnson because of his pace … and swing … and steepling bounce. He bowled so superbly in the World Cup and in the Caribbean that Johnson just had to forfeit that new ball. Even Johnson agreed with the decision. Starc has earned his reputation, no doubt. But if you have shared a dressing room with him in Leeds, or, perhaps more relevantly, during a wet game in Colwyn Bay against Glamorgan, the mystique evaporates. The dressing rooms at Colwyn Bay are what estate agents would describe as “cosy and compact” and it rained there for most of the match in early June 2012, although Starc still managed to take two wickets. To take the positives out of what must have been a grim few days – it must have been a good place to get to know your latest overseas player, warts and all.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Gary Ballance also benefited from that experience. He could never approach Root’s fluency on Wednesday but his mind was clear and in his own idiosyncratic way when facing Starc he was playing the ball not the bowler in that crucial stand with Root.</p> \n<p>The demystification process can be important. Mike Atherton has explained he could not take the abuse he routinely experienced early in his Test career from Merv Hughes entirely seriously partly because he had often sat in a dressing room with him after play. Atherton had chatted to him, laughed at him and witnessed his post-match aches and pains. There is always this discovery to be made: that the giants of the game are human; they may even be vulnerable. In this era that revelation is harder to discover given that players of opposite sides do not mingle as much.</p> \n<p>Root attacked Starc with the carefree panache that he might have displayed against him in the nets at Headingley three years ago – except that Root might not have realised that he could bat with such fluency back then. He launched into drives, confident that he could adjust to the swinging ball.</p> \n<p>In all he took 44 runs from Starc at a rate close to a run a ball, Tykes past and present relishing the contest. In the end Starc got him. This time the push-drive found the edge and Root was caught at slip. The bowler hardly celebrated even though Root is the most coveted of all the England wickets. Back in dressing rooms, rather more palatial than those in Colwyn Bay, Starc knew that his old colleague had delivered the critical innings of the day.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436385470247/Englands-Joe-Root-plays-a-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Joe Root plays a pull shot for four, one of 17 boundaries in his 134 against Australia.

But similarly it was hard not to conclude that the manoeuvre is best performed by those to whom it comes naturally.</p> \n<p>Cook, prior to this series, had watched from afar – or, more accurately, from a farm – as the one-day side had belted New Zealand to all parts. And then, after England trained for the Ashes at a golf resort in Spain, his Essex team-mates gave Lyon the treatment in Australia’s four-day warm-up match at Chelmsford, leaving the spinner with combined figures of one for 200.</p> \n<p>And so, perhaps craving a slice of the action himself, a player whose oft-listed qualities include patience, obduracy and self-denial tried to unleash his own rebranded batting style. It was very un-Cook and eventually, after 13 successive dot balls, Lyon got his man when the England captain went to cut a ball too close to his body and was caught behind by a jubilant Brad Haddin.</p> \n<p>This battle within a battle – one of the lesser trailed of the pre-Ashes analysis – was a first blow struck for his opposite number, Michael Clarke, who will doubtless have observed Cook’s inability to get on top of New Zealand’s Mark Craig during the drawn Test series. It also neatly summed up the confusion surrounding the buzzword of the summer: aggression.</p> \n<p>The England captain does not read the newspapers, something he betrayed when confusing two titles when speaking before this Test. But perhaps, after the appointment of his new head coach, Trevor Bayliss, a leaf through the next day’s offerings would have been instructive. Because among the many salient points made by the Australian in his 30-minute briefing at Lord’s, was his own understanding of the word.</p> \n<p>“Being aggressive is not necessarily trying to hit fours and sixes,” said Bayliss. “It’s that mental aggressiveness, thinking about rotating the strike, where are my singles, what bad balls can I hit for four, how are they trying to get me out, being mentally aware of what’s going on around you. You do that, the bad ball comes along, you hit it for four or six.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/wales-ashes-first-test-ecb-glamorgan-england-australia\">Wales puts on a woolly welcome as ECB tries to feed the Glamorgan fire | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Up until Lyon’s introduction in the 10th over Cook had done exactly this. He was fully on top of Australia’s muscular pace attack, albeit on a surface that was anything but The Gabba.

There have perhaps been plenty of other major sporting two-handers that have kicked off with a rain-sodden male-voice choir singing not one, not two but three national anthems. But none springs immediately to mind. “Never get mixed up in a Welsh wrangle,” Evelyn Waugh wrote in Decline and Fall. “It doesn’t end in blows like an Irish one, but goes on forever.” At times before the start of play in a series that, frankly, needs no introduction it was tempting to apply the same principle to Welsh cricket grounds and interminably woolly opening ceremonies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/alastair-cook-natural-game-england-australia\">Full marks for intent but Alastair Cook must play his natural game | Ali Martin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Happily sport has a habit of taking over on such occasions and by the end this felt like a successful, warmly received first return to Cardiff, six years on from the Welsh capital’s first Test match and four years since the last Test here, against Sri Lanka. If the city itself was some way short of full-blown Ashes fever before play – “What time does it kick off?” was the best this corespondent’s willing but agnostic taxi driver could muster – there was, as ever, a sense of tangible tension around the ground as Alastair Cook won the toss and chose to bat.</p> \n<p>At which point the only real hiccup of the day arrived in the shape of those unnecessary preliminaries, headed up by the choir, Only Men Aloud, described in the pre-publicity as “a honed and toned eight-piece vocal ensemble”. As Cardiff fretted and checked its watch, watching the drizzle roll in from the hills, there was a whizz-bang of mid-morning fireworks from an arrangement of wheelie bins, accompanied by the peculiar sight of soldiers in full camouflage kit still holding giant flags on the outfield as play was about to begin.</p> \n<p>For a moment or two, as the bowlers paced out their run-ups, it all looked like a slightly bizarre Michael Clarke funky fielding position. Fly slip. Two midwickets. Sixty soldiers at deep point. Either way this will hopefully go down as the best opening ceremony to an Ashes series ever staged – and more importantly the last.</p> \n<p>If the crowd were a little restrained on a chilly, damp morning they came to life half an hour into the day’s play with the first sight of Mitchell Johnson pounding in off that thrillingly muscular run-up, resembling as ever some astonishingly talented caveman in the process of inventing, off the cuff, the art of fast bowling.</p> \n<p>If there was a sense of slight reticence, of a crowd getting to know itself, then this is hardly surprising. Sophia Gardens has a long history as a place of public entertainment – at one point it was host to something called Barnum and Bailey’s travelling circus and menagerie – but it became Glamorgan’s official main residence only in 1995. Thirteen years later the new stand arrived, providing Cardiff with a ground capable of hosting a sell-out Test match crowd but only, it seems, when the Ashes roll around</p> \n<p>This is one thing about staging Tests here. The ground may be Welsh but the crowd is not particularly, with English and Aussie accents outnumbering a hospitable Welsh minority around the stands. The Swalec is basically half a full-size ground, with the low-rise Taff end arranged as the Eistedde stand (sponsored by Byndydd Foods) and on the opposite side a hodgepodge of structures, from the Scando log cabin pavilion, to the corrugated brutalism of the indoor sports centre to that occasional Test stand with its steep tiers of sun-hatted day-trippers.</p> \n<p>Some have already suggested staging the first Test here is a baffling decision, another example of English cricket tying itself in knots chasing the money. Certainly there is a good argument that the current bidding system for Tests should be abandoned in favour of centralised common sense. Perhaps the series could even be scheduled to give England the best chance of winning, in which case the current Test would be taking place at Trent Bridge.</p> \n<p>On the other hand there are sound developmental reasons to give Wales such a prominent occasion, if only in hope of feeding the fire. As long ago as 1964 a Glamorgan team featuring Don Shepherd and Tony Lewis beat Bobby Simpson’s Australians in a knife-edge finish at Swansea that saw 7,000 spectators congregate outside the pavilion and offer repeated renditions of the Welsh national anthem. But recent years have seen some thinner times.</p> \n<p>This summer it will be 10 years since the last Glamorgan cricketer played for England, Simon Jones helping to turn an Ashes series with thrilling, full-bodied career-ending spells of high-speed reverse-swing. In the decade since, Denmark, Papua New Guinea and Australia have all produced more England cricketers than Wales, while Ireland has become the go-to Celtic nursery for budding Test players.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/england-australia-first-test-ashes-match-report\">Joe Root rides luck before sparking England revival against Australia</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And yet for all the slight sense of a movable feast, Cardiff looked fuller than Headingley on the first day of the New Zealand Test this summer. By mid-afternoon, as Joe Root cuffed the ball through point yet again to bring up a sublime hundred, there was a warm, settled, bellicose feel to a near full-house crowd decked with yellow caps and crosses of St George.</p> \n<p>At which point, at the end of a richly storied first day, it really did not matter at all where this match was being played. There was early drama as Alastair Cook looked settled against the new ball before departing in a fug of popgun aggression against the spinner. To date Cook has not-attacked his way to 27 Test centuries. Here he swished himself to a standstill against Nathan Lyon and was caught behind.</p> \n<p>With Root scoring freely the rump of the day for England was a lovely, crisp assertive partnership with Gary Ballance, who was at his passive-aggressive best, still coiled back in his crease but ready to spring forward out of his shell like a particularly feisty mollusc.</p> \n<p>Root, meanwhile, continued to play with frictionless grace, a man who right now seems to have the ability to force bowlers to pitch short, so quickly does he pick up length and so lithe and so swift is his backfoot play. It was rich entertainment indeed, although at 343 for seven by the close this was still arguably Australia’s day.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/8/1436382076495/Opening-ceremony-firework-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Fireworks go off as the England and Australia  teams are presented before play in the first Ashes Test at the Swalec Stadium.

Like the first, all three malfunctioned. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/jul/21/ashes2005.ashes13\" title=\"\">By stumps</a> England were 92 for seven, 88 runs behind, and London’s public transport network was pretty much up and running again. Leaving the ground, spectators experienced what Wisden described as “minor transport disruption” travelling home.</p> \n<p>The failed attacks and their aftermath filled the front pages as the Ashes did the back. During the first Test English police were in the middle of the largest manhunt in their history. On the second day Jean Charles de Menezes was shot dead at Stockwell tube station. All this in the wake of the 7/7 attacks, which themselves had come the day after the city had been chosen as the host city for the 2012 Olympic Games. Australia’s fast bowler Jason Gillespie spoke about his unease. “If another bomb did go off here in England there’d be serious questions asked about the tour.” If there was another attack, he said, he would fly back to Australia. Behind the scenes the ECB’s support staff met the police to make plans for tighter security around the grounds.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/06/ashes-2015-a-to-z\">Ashes 2015: the A to Z of Ashes history</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The attacks would have a direct effect on the shape of the Ashes summer, as we shall see. But they had a diffuse influence on it too. The euphoria so many people felt in August and September can be seen, in a small way, as a reaction to the horrors of July. On the weekend of the fifth Test at The Oval, more than 20,000 people gathered in Regent’s Park to watch the match on a big screen. A pair of tickets for the second day’s play were sold on eBay for &pound;1,115, and a penthouse flat with a view of the ground was let for the week for a fee of &pound;20,000. Much as we reminisce about the series, it is easy to forget just how extraordinary the summer was; how, when it was all over, the England team became the first identifiable living people outside the Royal Family to be depicted on a set of stamps. Or that the manufacturer Danilo reportedly had 100,000 advance orders for its official Andrew Flintoff calendar.</p> \n<p>There were a lot of reasons for all this lunacy: the brilliance of the contest, the charms of the players, the fact it was all on free-to-air TV and the 16-year wait for a win. But on top of all that, perhaps Britain needed a source of pride, something to celebrate, an excuse to have a party. On the eve of the Oval Test, Brendan Barber, general secretary of the Trade Union Congress, urged employers to “make arrangements” to allow employees to watch the cricket. People, Barber explained, had to be allowed “to follow their heroes”.</p> \n<p>The crowd at Lord’s on the first day of the series was the largest to have gathered at the ground in 60 years, since, in fact, England played the Dominions in August 1945, the very first first-class match at the ground after the war. England lost then too.</p> \n<h2>Second Test, Edgbaston, 4-7 August, England won by two runs</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8bfea61ac351c50d1ce868b3bb64013eb33b7b08\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137276635/58cfdc9c-cb5f-4a50-a1b0-e909de05a099-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The picture of the series: Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee shake hands after the second Test.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The picture of the series: Andrew Flintoff and Brett Lee shake hands after the second Test.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I remember on my way to the ground that morning, thinking ‘This shouldn’t take long’,” says Tom Jenkins, the Guardian’s chief sports photographer “just half an hour or something.” England <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/07/ashes2005.ashes6\" title=\"\">needed two wickets</a>, Australia needed 107 runs to win. Once he was there the first task was to pick a spot. He had one in mind, on the low bench behind the boundary hoardings in front of the pavilion. The idea being that from there he could get a shot of the players coming back into the dressing room after they had completed their victory. Tom Shaw, a snapper working for Getty, had the same idea, and the two of them sat side by side.</p> \n<p>The shot they both got, the one that came to symbolise the 2005 Ashes, was not exactly an accident but it was not taken by design either. “The one thought I’d had in my head all morning was ‘I hope Fred takes the last wicket’,” Jenkins says. “Because it would have suited the occasion so well. He had such an amazing match.” So he had. Flintoff scored 68 runs in England’s first innings, 73 in their second. In between he had taken 3 for 52. And then, the previous evening, he had dismissed Justin Langer and Ricky Ponting in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2UnMxR3IM\" title=\"\">the space of a single extraordinary over</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FH2UnMxR3IM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FH2UnMxR3IM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  An extraordinary over by England’s Andrew Flintoff\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jenkins, along with everyone else, made the inevitable comparison. “I was thinking about Botham in ’81 and how, after he had bowled Terry Alderman to win the Test, he had run down the pitch and stooped <a href=\"http://\" title=\"\">to pick up a stump as a souvenir</a>. In my head I had a vision of a similar thing happening with Flintoff. He was bowling towards me and I had this vision of him sending Kasprowicz’s stumps flying.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjSDvdgTOzg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjSDvdgTOzg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Ian Botham is not stumped in a choice of souvenir after his magical Ashes performance in 1981\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The crowd had been raucous throughout the match, especially in the Hollies Stand. On the Friday a group of drunken fans threw an inflatable shark at Sir John Major. Major gamely tossed it right back at them. And on the Saturday two more were evicted after a stewardess complained that she found their outfits offensive. They had come dressed as bunny girls. But as Sunday wore on, the ground fell quiet. “People were terrified of what was going to happen. And I knew that, if I had been watching at home, I would have been an absolute wreck too. But because I was working, I had to keep focused.”</p> \n<p>When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/07/ashes2005.ashes7\" title=\"\">the last wicket fell</a>, the first thing Jenkins thought was: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr-4F_SFWxA\" title=\"\">“Oh, that wasn’t great.”</a> From a photographer’s point of view, “it was a mess, with Kasprowicz fending off a bouncer down the leg side.” And then everyone went absolutely bonkers. “And I immediately started thinking, ‘Where’s Flintoff? What is Flintoff doing?’” He found him just in time. “Flintoff had broken away from the pack and was over by Brett Lee. He dropped down and held out his hand to him. It lasted only a second and I didn’t think that much of it at the time” – or later, when he was looking through his photos on his laptop, trying to decide which to send through to the Guardian. “I looked at it and thought, ‘It’s quite nice but I’m sure the desk will want something more celebratory.’” He was right. The Guardian ran a shot of Marcus Trescothick jumping on top of a pile of his team-mates.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hr-4F_SFWxA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hr-4F_SFWxA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Not the best moment from a photographer’s point of view but delight for England in 2005.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was only after the Ashes was over that the photo was resurrected. “I still find it strange because it wasn’t a revolutionary picture or a revolutionary act. It was just one guy shaking another by the hand and saying ‘bad luck’. And so it’s surprising to me that that picture seems to have come to symbolise so much.” People often tell Tom that it reminds them of another famous photo, of Bobby Moore hugging Pel&eacute; after England’s defeat by Brazil in the 1970 World Cup. “One thing, now I think about it,” Jenkins says. “Is that TV didn’t get a good shot of it. The picture was fresh. People hadn’t seen it before.”</p> \n<p>What TV did get, however, was enough to fill a DVD. Jeff Foulser was, and still is, the chairman of Sunset + Vine, who were producing the coverage for Channel 4. Almost as soon as the match was over, Foulser got a text message from Gary Franses, his executive producer. “There’s a DVD in this match – The Greatest Test”. The ECB agreed. They wanted it ready ASAP. “Editing, production, distribution, it all had to be done by the end of that same week,” says Franses. “No one had ever done anything like that for cricket before.” By the time the next Test started The Greatest Test was in the shops. It sold 55,000 copies.</p> \n<h2>Third Test, Old Trafford, 11-15 August: match drawn</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dc6daba9cacd48e2c307ef7c1d234c02c272981\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137495536/f4060a17-55c9-46dd-a30c-92f7844b37a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A packed Old Trafford watches on with thousands of ticketless fans locked outside.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A packed Old Trafford watches on with thousands of ticketless fans locked outside.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Sibley/Action Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On 15 August Ken Grime was up shortly after the sun. Usually he worked in the marketing department at Lancashire Cricket Club but during Tests he doubled up as the match manager. He had to start early, to make the drive in to Old Trafford from his house in Bury. By 6.30am he was on his way. When he passed a bus stop, they saw a lad waiting for a ride. He was wearing an England top. ‘He’s keen,’ Grime thought. Then he passed the next bus stop, and saw two more teenagers, both in England shirts. At the third stop there were two men, obviously cricket supporters, you know the type, in hats, holding plastic bags full of food and clutching flasks. “And it was at that point,” Grime says, “that I got a sudden lurch in my stomach.”</p> \n<p>The day before, while England were still batting in the third innings, Grime had been in a meeting with his colleague Peter Ash, and Lancashire’s chief executive, Jim Cumbes. “It was a very brief conversation,” remembers Grime. They had to decide on the ticketing arrangements for the final day since tickets had not been sold in advance. They agreed they would charge &pound;10 for adults, half that for children, cash on the door, gates open 9am. They put an announcement out around the ground, on TV and radio.</p> \n<p>“It was almost a goodwill gesture, really,” Grime says. “The one thing about that meeting I’ve never forgot was that somebody said, ‘Do you think we’ll sell out?’ No one knew. So I said, “I think we’ll get about 14,000.” That would have been two-thirds capacity. At stumps on day three, Australia were 24 for 0, needing a record 423 to win, or to bat out 98 overs to draw the match. At 4am that night, Lancashire’s head of security, Pat McCabe, was woken by a phone call. It was the nightwatchman down at the ground. “Pat,” he said. “You’re not going to believe this, but there are people camping out down here, waiting for tickets.”</p> \n<p>Grime pulled on to Brian Statham Way at 7.30am. Ash had made the same journey an hour earlier. “I remember driving along Talbot Road thinking, ‘Have I overslept?’” Ash says, “because there were all these people walking towards the ground, more and more and more of them. I was sure my watch was broken.” By the time Grime arrived “the ground was absolutely surrounded. I will never forget it. I thought, ‘Oh My God! What have we done?’”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/michael-clarke-captain-australia-ashes-england\">Michael Clarke has evolved into a captain Australia has finally learned to love | Geoff Lemon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ash was already inside. “We got a load of market trader aprons and reels of tickets, the old ones where you rip the stubs off, and opened up early, at 8am. Thing was we were letting more and more people in but the queues weren’t going down, they were getting bigger and bigger. People kept appearing from all over.” The queues finally stretched all the way back to the metro station and it was then that the police stepped in. They shut the tram stations in town, to stop more people boarding. “We knew by then we couldn’t get everyone in. But people were shoving their money at us and shouting, ‘I’ll pay more than the person in front!’”</p> \n<p>Colin Gibson was the ECB’s head of communications. “I remember I had to do an interview with BBC radio Five Live, on the breakfast show with Victoria Derbyshire. And she said, ‘What’s your message to people who are planning to come today?’ and I had to say ‘Please, please don’t, because you’ll never get into the ground.’” Even the players were struggling to get to the ground. Andrew Flintoff was actually staying at his own home for that match, and the traffic was so bad that he had to skip the wrong way down a one-way street. “I got stopped by the police and had to say, ‘Please, I really need to get there.’ They just waved us through.”</p> \n<p>By 9am the ground was full. Around 20,000 people were stuck outside. “I remember we got a call saying, ‘You can only do 20 more people,’” Ash says. “And it was quite frightening, because I was thinking, ‘These people have been in the queue for that length of time and we’ve got to turn them away. So we sort of retreated back inside and had to push the gates across. And I just remember seeing all these hands coming through the gates clutching their 10-pound notes, people shouting, ‘Please, please will you let me in.’ It felt awful but you just couldn’t do anything about it. I’ve been here 21 years, and it is the most memorable day in all that time. The only thing that could have made it any better was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/15/ashes2005.ashes11\" title=\"\">if England had taken that last wicket</a>.” Australia, 371 for 9 at the close, survived by one wicket. Lee ended the match on the ground again, this time pounding it in triumph after surviving the final 24 balls with Glenn McGrath for company.</p> \n<h2>Fourth Test, Trent Bridge, 25-28 August: England won by three wickets</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be4485f5e79447b123314c241e6dad0be1fe66f3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137686373/be69f2a3-4baa-4d92-92e9-7438265b4b87-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The partnership of Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles, pictured here between Ian Bell Geraint Jones, at the Oval, was crucial in the fourth Test.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The partnership of Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles, pictured here between Ian Bell Geraint Jones, at the Oval, was crucial in the fourth Test.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Finn-Kelcey/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the least well known of the many accomplishments of Mark Nicholas is the fact that he is the man who made Mambo No5 a hit in Britain. In 1999 the production team at Sunset + Vine were struggling to find a piece of music for their new gig producing Channel 4’s cricket coverage. “We were all sitting around thinking, ‘What the hell are we going to do for opening titles?’” says the executive producer Franses. “Until one day Mark came in and stuck this track on. And after a second we all thought, ‘Thank you!” First time around that year, Mambo No5 stalled at No31 in the UK chart. Re-released in August, it shot to No1 and stayed there for a fortnight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCEHREGc6yY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/bCEHREGc6yY?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  One of the flops of the series … but at least it was off the field of play.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The ECB wanted the soundtrack to the summer of 2005 to be Jerusalem. In the end the long (and best) forgotten <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCEHREGc6yY\" title=\"\">official version was one of the team’s few flops</a>, peaking at No19. But for most cricket fans it is almost impossible to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRNaKp0hUg8\" title=\"\">listen to Mambo No 5</a> without a) thinking of Michael Vaughan’s pull shot and b) smiling at the memory. Which is odd, since, as Bega explains, his song is really about “sitting in the English Gardens in Munich, watching all these lovely ladies walk by”. (Turns out Jessica, Sandra, Rita and Monica were all real people.) Bega is German “and, as you know, cricket isn’t really a sport we follow in mainland Europe”. But his record company did arrange for him to visit a match. “I liked it because to me cricket seemed like baseball without all the spitting. And besides, I’d say that I’m, like, at least 50% of the reason why England won.”</p> \n<p>Sunset + Vine’s coverage was designed to make the sport accessible to people who were not necessarily experts. “Connoisseurs watch all the time, win or lose,” Franses explains. “But we hoped that at some point it would catch on with the general public so that a few uncommitted people might get into it.” They bought in the Snickometer, Hawk-Eye and the pitch mat, all designed to make the game easier to understand. They gave over the little breaks between to Simon Hughes, to explain the tactics and terminology of the game. “By 2005 we’d been doing it for six years by then so we knew what we were doing.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRNaKp0hUg8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MRNaKp0hUg8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  The new sound of cricket in 2005\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In previous years Channel 4’s coverage had been pulling in “two million viewers on a good day”. In 2005 “the ratings were sensational. I think there were more than five million people watching on average each day. Which is unheard of.” Compared with the 2001 Ashes, the proportion of female viewers was up by just under 10% and the proportion of under-15s by almost 75%. At first the cricket had to fight for screen time with the horse racing, and there were often a lot of complaints that it cut into Channel 4’s evening programming. Later in the summer the executives stopped worrying about that. “Racing hardly got a look in, because the cricket was delivering,” says Foulser. “Never mind the number of times Hollyoaks got cancelled because the cricket was over-running!”</p> \n<p>The ratings peaked late on the fourth day at Trent Bridge, as Matthew Hoggard and Ashley Giles <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/aug/28/ashes2005.ashes8\" title=\"\">eked out the runs England needed to win</a>. 8.4m people tuned in to watch. “It became prime time,” says Franses. “You felt the whole country was watching that. We realised then that this was bigger than anything we had been before. And to be honest, I think it was probably bigger than anything that has happened in cricket since.” Foulser agrees. “That was the one. That was when it began to feel like a national event.” By the end of the year Sunset + Vine’s boxset of the series had become the biggest-selling sports DVD of all time. “We shifted 635,000 units.”</p> \n<p>Shame was the success felt bitter-sweet. “We’d been told the previous December that Channel 4 had lost the rights, so we knew it was going to be our last summer,” says Foulser. “When they saw the ratings, people at C4 were asking, ‘Have we made a bit of a cock-up here?’ But they were just outbid. Sky paid a lot of money for the rights and everything has a price. But I remember C4 had very mixed feelings about it, because the cricket had really over-delivered for them.”</p> \n<p>“We connected with an audience probably as much as anybody has ever done,” Foulser says. “On the last day at The Oval the camera guys got a shot of some fans holding a banner saying ‘Thanks 4 the memories’, with the C4 logo. And that sort of summed it up for us, because it meant we had done something that had really got into people’s minds and homes. It was the perfect time for cricket and the perfect time for Sunset + Vine. Best summer of our careers, we always say.”</p> \n<h2>Fifth Test, The Oval, 8-12 September: match drawn</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7bbd9ee85c78b89d74cc0034ad9f2d791f221d6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436137750242/7f0f5780-7d7b-43e8-bc47-de2c360bb4d9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"England's Kevin Pietersen acknowledges the applause of the crowd as he walks off having scored 158 runs during the final day of the fifth Test .\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s Kevin Pietersen acknowledges the applause of the crowd as he walks off having scored 158 runs during the final day of the fifth Test .</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieran Doherty/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On the last day it felt as if everything stopped, because so much actually had. Trading on the stock market was down by 20%. Trafficlink, the firm providing real-time traffic information, reported that in London the roads were “a lot quieter than usual as people stay home or stay on longer in the office to watch the cricket”. Tony Blair, taking a tour of the City of London Academy, had to apologise for dragging his audience away from the small television set in the corner of the hall and ended his speech with an update from The Oval.</p> \n<p>At Southwark Crown Court, a clerk opened the proceedings in a complex fraud trial by offering to provide a series of display cards through the day to show the latest scores. The Confederation of British Industry approved. They advised employers that “on an occasion as exciting and as big as this week’s Ashes” employers should “be flexible in allowing staff to keep tabs on the score”. Even The Queen, we were told, was watching at Balmoral. Certainly <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/sep/12/ashes2005.ashes12\" title=\"\">when the match was drawn and the Ashes won</a>, she sent her “warmest congratulations” to the two teams.</p> \n<p>By then it was all over, except for one little group who were just beginning the longest night of the summer. On the Sunday evening of the fourth Test, a handful of ECB employees gathered together to work out what to do if England won. They called it Operation Victory. It was top-secret. England’s coach, Duncan Fletcher, insisted that the players could not be allowed to find out about it, which was why the ECB denied the story whenever journalists got wind of it.</p> \n<p>The plan, pushed by the team’s sponsors, was to stage a “people’s parade” in Birmingham, ending at Edgbaston. “Because of the bombings we had always thought that, if England won the Ashes, it would be very unlikely we would do a street parade,” says Gibson. “Because there was so much nervousness about doing it.” But on Monday 5 September, three days before the start of the final Test, the ECB got a call from the Mayor of London’s office. Ken Livingstone was adamant that, if there was going to be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/sep/13/ashes2005.ashes12\" title=\"\">a victory parade</a>, it had to be in London and specifically in Trafalgar Square – the same spot, of course, where there had been a party when London won the Olympic bid. “He really wanted the world to see that London was open for business and he thought that this was the way to do it.”</p> \n<p>On the Tuesday the ECB was given the green light. Its event manager, David Clarke, popped along to the mayor’s office for a meeting. “I was expecting there would be about five people around a table and there were about 30, including the river police and the man in charge of wastebins on the route, all sorts.” The ECB had to organise the stage, the security and the broadcasting arrangements with all four of Sky, ITV, the BBC and Channel 4. Everyone wanted live coverage. Then it had to negotiate with the City of London, the mayor’s office and its own sponsors. There was a late twist to the plan when another call came through from the prime minister’s office, explaining that Blair would be keen to host the team after they had left Trafalgar Square.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/ashes-2015-mitchell-starc-australians-england-tail\">Ashes 2015: Mitchell Starc and Australians plan to sting England’s tail</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And then the ECB had to wait. No one knew whether any of this was actually going to happen and, as the fortunes of the two teams fluctuated through the final day, the parade was on, then off, then on, then off, then on again. England were 127 for 5 at lunch, with a lead of only 133. “It was only in the last hour of the last day of the last Test that we knew for sure,” Gibson says. The ECB had two buses ready in a depot in Hertfordshire, waiting to be painted in the sponsor’s colours. “Those buses were going in and out, and in and out, of the garage. At 6pm I remember someone asked me, ‘Do you think it’s safe we can get the bus painted now?’” By 6am the next day the buses were outside the team hotel at Tower Hill. So were several crates of champagne sent by Elton John, one reason why Flintoff had to be poured off the bus into Trafalgar Square.</p> \n<p>Everyone had been so busy making the last-minute arrangements that no one had really stopped to ask how many people were actually going to turn out. “That morning we all wondered, ‘Will anybody actually come out?’” says Gibson. “And then when we left the hotel and the bus turned the corner, we saw all these people lining the road up Tower Hill. It was packed at nine o’clock.” Clarke was already in Trafalgar Square. “I got there at 5.30 that morning and there were people already there,” he says. At one point he got a call from a steward asking if he knew who Brian Lara was “because there was a man claiming to be him down in the crowd and he wanted to get through to see the team.” It really was Lara, who had stopped off on his way to the airport.</p> \n<p>Best estimates are that around 50,000 came out to cheer on the team. “And I remember thinking,” Clarke says, “‘All this?
