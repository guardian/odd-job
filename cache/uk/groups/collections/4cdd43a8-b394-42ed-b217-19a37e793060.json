And now, after just 15 days in the job, it would appear the standards expected by England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, have permeated through to his new team.</p> \n<p>During Australia’s first innings here in Cardiff, one which saw them fold in the face of relentless discipline – only one side seems to be grumbling about the surface so far – every catch went to hand and two can be filed in the top drawer. For many, this will of course be the expected benchmark for any international side; to praise fielders for taking chances is to applaud the pilot who lands the plane safely.</p> \n<p>Their adhesive paws in Cardiff thus far must been viewed in light of their early summer, however, one where 11 catches were grassed in the drawn Test series against New Zealand, costing an aggregate of 250 runs. Some 182 of these came in the series-levelling defeat at Headingley, only 17 fewer than the tourists’ ultimate margin of victory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/10/ashes-2015-england-v-australia-first-test-day-three-live\">Ashes 2015: England v Australia –&nbsp;first Test, day three –&nbsp;live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not all of those chances were regulation, but then neither were they here. Alastair Cook’s removal of David Warner at first slip that got the ball rolling on Thursday afternoon required a flying leap high to his right to hold on two-handed after Jimmy Anderson got one to nudge the edge of the left-hander’s meaty blade.</p> \n<p>Joe Root’s effort to wrap up the Australian innings on Friday morning was a frictionless dive low to his left at third slip after the Australian No10 Mitchell Starc took the ill-advised decision to attempt an expansive drive to a full and late outswinger from Anderson. It also provided the Yorkshireman a chance to remind his former county team-mate that a finger-to-the-lips send-off ain’t that funny when one is on the receiving end.</p> \n<p>In between we saw Cook snaffle a simple take off Steve Smith at short mid-on, Moeen Ali hold a smart return catch off Michael Clarke and Anderson make light work of Adam Voges’ mistimed drive at short extra-cover. Jos Buttler behind the stumps, who had predecessor Matt Prior join him and coach Bruce French for a pre-series session, held the two nicks that came his way.</p> \n<p>So what has occurred between Headingley and now? Well, Bayliss and a four-day training camp in Spain. With their hands slightly tied by facilities – and perhaps the excess baggage charges associated with a glut of kitbags – England opted to leave the batting equipment at home and keep the physical stuff to fitness and fielding.</p> \n<p>Perhaps a by-product of this focus, whether intended or not, was that batsmen in particular were unable to go into themselves and demand throwdown after throwdown. Instead, the only way to impress their new boss, and apologise to the fielding coach, Chris Taylor, for their early summer sloppiness, was to ace the drills in Almer&iacute;a, which took place every day of the trip.</p> \n<p>Bayliss also resisted the calls to sub Ian Bell out of second slip in favour of the Yorkshire regular Adam Lyth, despite three drops at Lord’s against New Zealand. This particular decision had the confidence of the individual factored in, as well as the technical side of things. And while nothing came his way during Australia’s first-innings demise, Bayliss may see Bell’s second-innings 60 – one which broke a binary run of form – as an indirect repayment of sorts.</p> \n<p>A head coach taking a keen interest in fielding is nothing new. But if Peter Moores was an energetic presence during the pre-play warm-ups, Bayliss is a looming one. Decked out in a floppy sunhat and with an air of Duncan Fetcher about him from a distance, the Australian spent Friday morning prowling on the touchline during the football warm-up, bat in hand, a pile of balls at feet ready for the proper preparation to begin; the homework that follows fun time. The players now know what he expects and so far, so very good.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436548072100/Joe-Root--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Joe Root takes a sharp chance to dismiss Australia's Mitchell Starc on day three of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.

Moeen Ali and Stuart Broad are set to resume on 26 and nought respectively, with Root calling on the pair to back up his hard work.</p> \n<p>“I’m really pleased with the way things have gone. I rode my luck at times, especially early on,” he said. “When they attack, that’s the best time to attack them because that’s where the gaps are. It’s not going to work every time but fortunately it did today. Hopefully it’s the first of a few and not just a one-off.”</p> \n<p>Root was described by Josh Hazlewood, who took three for 70, as England’s most improved player since the last time the sides met, a compliment that was well received by the right-hander who went on to credit being stood down for the fifth Test on the 2013-14 tour as the reason behind his current form.</p> \n<p>“That’s nice of him to say and it’s nice to get out there and get a big score, especially so early in the series, but we want to win back the Ashes and we have to back that up now. It’s going to be a really good contest and a really interesting series,” he said.</p> \n<p>“Getting dropped was a feeling I don’t want to go through again but in this sport you have to deal with hard times. It shows self-belief and self-confidence. I feel in a really good place at the minute. I just keep things as simple as possible and take the positive option when I can.”</p> \n<p>Asked who was in the ascendancy, Root replied: “It’s very hard to say, the very pleasing thing is we have got to this position and hopefully we can build on it in the morning. To look too far ahead would be silly. We are in the position we are, it’s important we get to 400 and past it if there is a chance to do so.”</p> \n<p>Root, following the early removals of Adam Lyth, Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, joined the No3 Gary Ballance at the crease, who shrugged off his own struggle for runs with a hard-fought 61. The Yorkshire pair combined for a stand of 153 that included a wicketless afternoon session and helped wrestle back control.</p> \n<p>“Gary’s innings was so important for us today – the mental strength he showed, the determination and the Yorkshire grit, if you like – the way he went about things was really pleasing,” Root said.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t pretty to watch at times but it was vital to us to get a decent position in the game. That’s why he’s so integral to our team and such an important part of our dressing room.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/joe-root-england-australia-ashes\">England centurion Joe Root exploits dressing-room insight of Mitchell Starc | Vic Marks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Despite all the talk about sledging, the on-field relations between the sides did not hit boiling point although Starc, who claimed three for 84, did give Ben Stokes a send-off, putting his finger to his lips, after clean bowling the all-rounder for 52.</p> \n<p>“I’m not too sure what that was about but Starcy got the last laugh,” Hazlewood said. “The way Root batted was pretty special. We’ll have to come back with a plan, or a couple of plans, to be able to nullify him over the rest of the series.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I was pretty nervous but excited and was happy with how I went; I think the game’s level. I think we were good in patches and if you put the ball in right area there was enough [assistance].”</p> \n<p>The Cardiff pitch attracted much criticism following the initial exchanges, with a number of deliveries bouncing twice before being taken by the wicketkeeper. The turgid surface negated the pace of Mitchell Johnson, the scourge of England in Australia 18 months ago, as he ended the opening day wicketless from his 20 overs.</p> \n<p>“Johnson is a fine bowler but we played him extremely well,” Root said. “You have you give credit to us. I’m sure there will be times in the series when he will bowl well and hopefully we can handle it as we did today.</p> \n<p>“It is a little bit slow, you see the first few balls not carry and think: ‘Oh God’. There might be variable bounce but if you bowl in the right areas and have good plans, that can be just as effective as lateral movement. Fingers crossed, we can start well with the new ball, get some breakthroughs and put them under pressure.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436387725424/Englands-Joe-Root-hits-ou-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root admitted he rode his luck but was able to make Australia suffer after being dropped second ball  on the opening day of the first Ashes Test.

Of these Steve Smith will get his chance perhaps on the second day to show his remarkable progress from perceived clown to the top-ranked batsman in the world. For now, though, the rise and rise of Joe Root, the epitome of youthful exuberance, continues. Root, not yet 25 years old, is having the time of his life, in that state, unencumbered by theory and over-analysis, where batting becomes so easy that it must be hard for him to comprehend how difficult it can be for others.</p> \n<p>Dropped by Brad Haddin behind the wicket from the second ball he faced from Mitchell Starc, he made a sublime century, his second against Australia and the seventh of his Test career, that pulled England away from a tricky situation at 43 for three, and he was not to be dismissed until Starc returned for his sixth spell and with his first ball, angled across, had him well caught low down at first slip by Shane Watson.</p> \n<p>By then, though, he had made 134, hitting 17 fours in the process, most of them sweetly through extra cover. There was assistance. Gary Ballance, whose idiosyncratic technique will have been scrutinised by Australia and no doubt left them wondering how precisely he has managed to average in the mid-50s, weathered the early storm that saw the loss of Adam Lyth, in the second over of the day, and then Alastair Cook and Ian Bell immediately after the first drinks break.</p> \n<p>Ballance was to make 61 in three and three quarter hours during which he scarcely made a mistake until he was lbw to a full ball from the persevering Josh Hazlewood. But by then he and Root had added 153 for the fourth wicket, effectively wiping out the earlier setback.</p> \n<p>Later Ben Stokes arrived to play with freedom once again, making 52, with seven fours and two sixes, one a top-edged hook over fine-leg and the other straight from Lyons, before he was bowled by a beauty from Starc that pitched around middle and took off stump. “Sssh” Starc mimed, finger to lips, as Stokes grumped his way off: sound advice.</p> \n<p>These really are remarkable times for Root. From the start of play he had sat on the dressing room balcony, grinning away at the lark of it all. He watched as Lyth edged Hazlewood’s third ball low to David Warner in the gully, who took a sharp catch well – a good delivery that swung into the left-hander, prompting him to look legside, but then held off the pitch. Soon after, Cook, looking to be positive against Nathan Lyon’s offspin but unable to get away any of the 13 previous deliveries from him, looked for his favourite cut and edged behind.</p> \n<p>One run later and Bell all but had his feet knocked from beneath him by Starc’s yorker and was lbw, thus continuing a sorry run of Test match scores – 11, 1, 0, 0, 1, 29, 12, 1 and now 1 again – since he made 143 against West Indies in the first Test in Antigua back in April.</p> \n<p>If it was a ticklish first hour for England, who won the toss and had no hesitation in batting despite some overcast conditions and the occasional squally shower, then those who had taken their seats early expecting to see some fire and brimstone from the Australian pace attack would have been disappointed. Local knowledge had suggested that county pitches had been slow this season and this, devoid of grass, looks to be no exception.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/wales-ashes-first-test-ecb-glamorgan-england-australia\">Wales puts on a woolly welcome as ECB tries to feed the Glamorgan fire | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Haddin stood a long way back for Starc’s opening over, only to find two deliveries bouncing before they reached him. If the ball nibbled around a little and swung too, potentially taking the pitch out of the equation, then it would still have signalled a tough day for the bowlers, who could see the law of diminishing returns: the harder they flogged the ball into the pitch, the slower it came off it.</p> \n<p>It may suit skiddy bowlers more. Under the circumstances the Australians stuck to their task handsomely, the reward of three wickets apiece to Hazlewood and particularly Starc more than well-earned. The scoring rate throughout the day was admirable –in excess of four runs per over – but turgid, emasculating surfaces such as this do Test cricket few favours.</p> \n<p>By the close England had reached 343 for seven, a total with which they should be content but not more than that. The wicket of Jos Buttler, for 27, shortly before the close, as he hit Hazlewood tamely to mid-on, meant that Australia may well be the more satisfied of the two teams.</p> \n<p>The manner in which Starc and Hazlewood were able to adjust their length to the conditions, bowling fuller than they might habitually be used to, and risking being driven in the process, was exemplary and the ball was given the opportunity to swing as a result. Jimmy Anderson, in particular, will see encouragement in this but it promises to be just as hard for the England bowlers as their Australian counterparts.</p> \n<p>As it is, it will be down to Moeen Ali, who has batted calmly for his 26, and Stuart Broad to try to get England up to 400 and beyond. Broad, with great commonsense, and no little courage, turned down a long single in the final over in order to ensure Moeen survived and it will not have gone unnoticed: he can be sure of a working-over first thing, almost certainly from Mitchell Johnson.</p> \n<p>Slow pitch it might be but it is quick enough to make life uncomfortable, as Johnson, wicketless in the day, might well remind him. “And just wait ’til I get you on a quick ’un.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436382610372/Joe-Root-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root raises his bat to acknowledge the adoring support after his innings of 134 on day one of the Ashes in Cardiff.

On both occasions Root has been grateful to the Australia keeper for not putting his hands together more successfully earlier in his innings.</p> \n<p>At Lord’s two years ago Haddin and Michael Clarke glared at one another when Root on four edged a ball from Shane Watson between them. Root finished with 180, a second-innings knock which set up an emphatic England victory. This innings, which was more important still since it began with England wobbling ominously on 43 for three, was also dependent on Haddin missing a difficult chance – from Root’s second ball.</p> \n<p>Root had barely survived the previous delivery from Mitchell Starc. The lanky left-armer had just sent Ian Bell packing with a full-length inswinger. Root’s first ball jagged into the pads off the pitch, which is even trickier to combat. All the Australians opened their lungs; the umpire Marais Erasmus was unmoved; a review was considered but Root, the mischievous Root who has occasionally displayed the capacity to wind up Australians, was smiling. He knew the ball, one of Starc’s very best, had conveniently taken his inside edge before thudding into pads which were located bang in front of the stumps. The next one had Haddin sprawling to his right. Root was no longer smiling, nor was the wicketkeeper, nor Starc.</p> \n<p>The duel between Starc and Root was compelling. In that spell an hour into the game Starc was the most dangerous bowler on the pitch, swinging the ball late at pace. Stunned by his first two deliveries, Root reacted as England had promised – with aggression.</p> \n<p>In Starc’s next over Root took 11 runs from two silky drives and a back-foot punch and he was on his way. Root did not look overawed. This would probably have been the case if he had never come across Starc before. They shared a dressing room for Yorkshire twice in the County Championship in 2012. That usually helps to demystify an opponent.</p> \n<p>If you had met any Australian before this tour and asked about Starc he or she would have taken a sharp intake of breath and raised eyebrows before reminding you Starc had just taken the new ball from Mitchell Johnson because of his pace … and swing … and steepling bounce. He bowled so superbly in the World Cup and in the Caribbean that Johnson just had to forfeit that new ball. Even Johnson agreed with the decision. Starc has earned his reputation, no doubt. But if you have shared a dressing room with him in Leeds, or, perhaps more relevantly, during a wet game in Colwyn Bay against Glamorgan, the mystique evaporates. The dressing rooms at Colwyn Bay are what estate agents would describe as “cosy and compact” and it rained there for most of the match in early June 2012, although Starc still managed to take two wickets. To take the positives out of what must have been a grim few days – it must have been a good place to get to know your latest overseas player, warts and all.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Gary Ballance also benefited from that experience. He could never approach Root’s fluency on Wednesday but his mind was clear and in his own idiosyncratic way when facing Starc he was playing the ball not the bowler in that crucial stand with Root.</p> \n<p>The demystification process can be important. Mike Atherton has explained he could not take the abuse he routinely experienced early in his Test career from Merv Hughes entirely seriously partly because he had often sat in a dressing room with him after play. Atherton had chatted to him, laughed at him and witnessed his post-match aches and pains. There is always this discovery to be made: that the giants of the game are human; they may even be vulnerable. In this era that revelation is harder to discover given that players of opposite sides do not mingle as much.</p> \n<p>Root attacked Starc with the carefree panache that he might have displayed against him in the nets at Headingley three years ago – except that Root might not have realised that he could bat with such fluency back then. He launched into drives, confident that he could adjust to the swinging ball.</p> \n<p>In all he took 44 runs from Starc at a rate close to a run a ball, Tykes past and present relishing the contest. In the end Starc got him. This time the push-drive found the edge and Root was caught at slip. The bowler hardly celebrated even though Root is the most coveted of all the England wickets. Back in dressing rooms, rather more palatial than those in Colwyn Bay, Starc knew that his old colleague had delivered the critical innings of the day.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436385470247/Englands-Joe-Root-plays-a-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Joe Root plays a pull shot for four, one of 17 boundaries in his 134 against Australia.

But similarly it was hard not to conclude that the manoeuvre is best performed by those to whom it comes naturally.</p> \n<p>Cook, prior to this series, had watched from afar – or, more accurately, from a farm – as the one-day side had belted New Zealand to all parts. And then, after England trained for the Ashes at a golf resort in Spain, his Essex team-mates gave Lyon the treatment in Australia’s four-day warm-up match at Chelmsford, leaving the spinner with combined figures of one for 200.</p> \n<p>And so, perhaps craving a slice of the action himself, a player whose oft-listed qualities include patience, obduracy and self-denial tried to unleash his own rebranded batting style. It was very un-Cook and eventually, after 13 successive dot balls, Lyon got his man when the England captain went to cut a ball too close to his body and was caught behind by a jubilant Brad Haddin.</p> \n<p>This battle within a battle – one of the lesser trailed of the pre-Ashes analysis – was a first blow struck for his opposite number, Michael Clarke, who will doubtless have observed Cook’s inability to get on top of New Zealand’s Mark Craig during the drawn Test series. It also neatly summed up the confusion surrounding the buzzword of the summer: aggression.</p> \n<p>The England captain does not read the newspapers, something he betrayed when confusing two titles when speaking before this Test. But perhaps, after the appointment of his new head coach, Trevor Bayliss, a leaf through the next day’s offerings would have been instructive. Because among the many salient points made by the Australian in his 30-minute briefing at Lord’s, was his own understanding of the word.</p> \n<p>“Being aggressive is not necessarily trying to hit fours and sixes,” said Bayliss. “It’s that mental aggressiveness, thinking about rotating the strike, where are my singles, what bad balls can I hit for four, how are they trying to get me out, being mentally aware of what’s going on around you. You do that, the bad ball comes along, you hit it for four or six.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/wales-ashes-first-test-ecb-glamorgan-england-australia\">Wales puts on a woolly welcome as ECB tries to feed the Glamorgan fire | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Up until Lyon’s introduction in the 10th over Cook had done exactly this.

There have perhaps been plenty of other major sporting two-handers that have kicked off with a rain-sodden male-voice choir singing not one, not two but three national anthems. But none springs immediately to mind. “Never get mixed up in a Welsh wrangle,” Evelyn Waugh wrote in Decline and Fall. “It doesn’t end in blows like an Irish one, but goes on forever.” At times before the start of play in a series that, frankly, needs no introduction it was tempting to apply the same principle to Welsh cricket grounds and interminably woolly opening ceremonies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/alastair-cook-natural-game-england-australia\">Full marks for intent but Alastair Cook must play his natural game | Ali Martin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Happily sport has a habit of taking over on such occasions and by the end this felt like a successful, warmly received first return to Cardiff, six years on from the Welsh capital’s first Test match and four years since the last Test here, against Sri Lanka. If the city itself was some way short of full-blown Ashes fever before play – “What time does it kick off?” was the best this corespondent’s willing but agnostic taxi driver could muster – there was, as ever, a sense of tangible tension around the ground as Alastair Cook won the toss and chose to bat.</p> \n<p>At which point the only real hiccup of the day arrived in the shape of those unnecessary preliminaries, headed up by the choir, Only Men Aloud, described in the pre-publicity as “a honed and toned eight-piece vocal ensemble”. As Cardiff fretted and checked its watch, watching the drizzle roll in from the hills, there was a whizz-bang of mid-morning fireworks from an arrangement of wheelie bins, accompanied by the peculiar sight of soldiers in full camouflage kit still holding giant flags on the outfield as play was about to begin.</p> \n<p>For a moment or two, as the bowlers paced out their run-ups, it all looked like a slightly bizarre Michael Clarke funky fielding position. Fly slip. Two midwickets. Sixty soldiers at deep point. Either way this will hopefully go down as the best opening ceremony to an Ashes series ever staged – and more importantly the last.</p> \n<p>If the crowd were a little restrained on a chilly, damp morning they came to life half an hour into the day’s play with the first sight of Mitchell Johnson pounding in off that thrillingly muscular run-up, resembling as ever some astonishingly talented caveman in the process of inventing, off the cuff, the art of fast bowling.</p> \n<p>If there was a sense of slight reticence, of a crowd getting to know itself, then this is hardly surprising. Sophia Gardens has a long history as a place of public entertainment – at one point it was host to something called Barnum and Bailey’s travelling circus and menagerie – but it became Glamorgan’s official main residence only in 1995. Thirteen years later the new stand arrived, providing Cardiff with a ground capable of hosting a sell-out Test match crowd but only, it seems, when the Ashes roll around</p> \n<p>This is one thing about staging Tests here. The ground may be Welsh but the crowd is not particularly, with English and Aussie accents outnumbering a hospitable Welsh minority around the stands. The Swalec is basically half a full-size ground, with the low-rise Taff end arranged as the Eistedde stand (sponsored by Byndydd Foods) and on the opposite side a hodgepodge of structures, from the Scando log cabin pavilion, to the corrugated brutalism of the indoor sports centre to that occasional Test stand with its steep tiers of sun-hatted day-trippers.</p> \n<p>Some have already suggested staging the first Test here is a baffling decision, another example of English cricket tying itself in knots chasing the money. Certainly there is a good argument that the current bidding system for Tests should be abandoned in favour of centralised common sense. Perhaps the series could even be scheduled to give England the best chance of winning, in which case the current Test would be taking place at Trent Bridge.</p> \n<p>On the other hand there are sound developmental reasons to give Wales such a prominent occasion, if only in hope of feeding the fire. As long ago as 1964 a Glamorgan team featuring Don Shepherd and Tony Lewis beat Bobby Simpson’s Australians in a knife-edge finish at Swansea that saw 7,000 spectators congregate outside the pavilion and offer repeated renditions of the Welsh national anthem. But recent years have seen some thinner times.</p> \n<p>This summer it will be 10 years since the last Glamorgan cricketer played for England, Simon Jones helping to turn an Ashes series with thrilling, full-bodied career-ending spells of high-speed reverse-swing. In the decade since, Denmark, Papua New Guinea and Australia have all produced more England cricketers than Wales, while Ireland has become the go-to Celtic nursery for budding Test players.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/england-australia-first-test-ashes-match-report\">Joe Root rides luck before sparking England revival against Australia</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And yet for all the slight sense of a movable feast, Cardiff looked fuller than Headingley on the first day of the New Zealand Test this summer. By mid-afternoon, as Joe Root cuffed the ball through point yet again to bring up a sublime hundred, there was a warm, settled, bellicose feel to a near full-house crowd decked with yellow caps and crosses of St George.</p> \n<p>At which point, at the end of a richly storied first day, it really did not matter at all where this match was being played. There was early drama as Alastair Cook looked settled against the new ball before departing in a fug of popgun aggression against the spinner. To date Cook has not-attacked his way to 27 Test centuries. Here he swished himself to a standstill against Nathan Lyon and was caught behind.</p> \n<p>With Root scoring freely the rump of the day for England was a lovely, crisp assertive partnership with Gary Ballance, who was at his passive-aggressive best, still coiled back in his crease but ready to spring forward out of his shell like a particularly feisty mollusc.</p> \n<p>Root, meanwhile, continued to play with frictionless grace, a man who right now seems to have the ability to force bowlers to pitch short, so quickly does he pick up length and so lithe and so swift is his backfoot play. It was rich entertainment indeed, although at 343 for seven by the close this was still arguably Australia’s day.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/8/1436382076495/Opening-ceremony-firework-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Fireworks go off as the England and Australia  teams are presented before play in the first Ashes Test at the Swalec Stadium.
