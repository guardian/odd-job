Watch Broad from afar enough times and you start to see the signs, little hints that England’s streakiest, delicately engineered, match-winning new ball bowler could be about to clank into high gear.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/england-win-ashes-opener-as-stuart-broad-breaks-australias-top-order\">England win Ashes opener as Stuart Broad breaks Australia’s top order</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For a long-time England observer the feeling can be similar to watching one of your own offspring in action. You get to know – or at least imagine that you know – the ticks and tells, each little gathering hint of spring and snap that suggests the rifle sights narrowing, torpedoes locked in, the force beginning to crackle.</p> \n<p>On a day of passing cloud and tepid high summer heat, Broad bowled with wonderful urgency and precision, in the process turning this first Test decisively England’s way. There is an ease to his approach at his best, this great slender conifer of a man leaning forward at first, ears pinned back, then gradually, almost bashfully unfurling himself to his full height at the point of delivery. Not so much a wrecking ball, he was instead a relentless, suffocating presence running in from the Cathedral Road end.</p> \n<p>Broad bowled fast and full here, finding enough nip and bounce in the fourth-day pitch to discomfit every batsman who faced him. The first hour brought him the wicket of Chris Rogers, caught by Ian Bell at second slip as Australia lost their first wicket at 19.</p> \n<p>Most compelling of all was Broad’s duel with David Warner, a pedigree attacking opener but a man in need not just of a way into this series, but of a start in England, a method of playing in a country where he averages 22 after six Tests, against 46 elsewhere. England won here in part because they batted with new-found brio and aggression. But also because of the same-old same-old, England’s most prolific fast-bowling pair performing as required in occasionally helpful conditions. That it was Broad rather than Jimmy Anderson who produced the decisive spell on day four might have come as a surprise to some.</p> \n<p>Only Broad will know for sure if he really was irritated by the pre-series talk of Australia’s greater fast bowling hand, a strength offset, the assumption was, by the presence of Anderson. Broad barely got a mention in the previews, despite that going back to March 2013 his record reads 120 wickets at 26 with seven five-fors, just about edging Anderson’s own 118 at 27 with five five-wicket hauls.</p> \n<p>This is not to downplay Anderson’s influence here. Between them in the first two hours, England’s new-ball pair produced a sublime, high-pressure period of sustained accuracy from around and over the wicket that, while it didn’t quite skittle the Australian top order, established a hand on the throat that was never relaxed.</p> \n<p>With the crowd still fluttering into place Anderson produced an in-ducker with the second ball of the day that hit Rogers square in what we might perhaps now call the Alastairs. Rogers grinned and walked it off. Ten minutes of leave-and-prod later he was dropped by Joe Root off Anderson in a close third slip position. It was, though, the action at the other end that defined the morning’s play, and which will perhaps leave the greatest impression on the rest of the series. Either way Broad versus Warner was box office.</p> \n<p>First Warner was beaten by a full ball that seamed away, inducing a spasm of a short-arm drive, the batsman playing the line then furiously reeling his hands back in. A shorter ball zipped past a narrow defensive prod. Then Warner was struck on the pad, producing an appeal from Broad that while loud and prolonged, was still a little short of the full jazz-hands. To his credit Warner stuck at his methods, playing not just late but too late at times, staying compact at the crease and enjoying a little good fortune too.</p> \n<p>He is not just a fine batsman but a fascinating one, Australia’s frontiersman of the new world and a player who for all his runs, his uncluttered method and his thrilling talent is still learning this longer game on the job.</p> \n<p>If Warner was to provide a match-turning hundred here it would simply arrive in the flow of things, incidental to the unchanging methods of a man who seems to keep playing the same, unceasing innings across every format, offering not a selection of gears and modes but another draught whatever the weather of pure unadulterated David Warner.</p> \n<p>He spent 23 balls toying with the idea of playing like a Test opener in England, scoring one run in the process and hanging in against three straight maidens from Broad. In all Broad beat Warner’s outside edge eight times through a combination of nip, bounce and simple accuracy.</p> \n<p>In between times Broad fielded at close funky-mid-off for his new-ball partner, diving full length to take a bunted drive from Warner almost hand in hand with the bowler, a move completed with a mutual pat of the rump, confirming the impression of two bowlers working, as was said of Braque and Picasso, “like two men roped together on a mountain”.</p> \n<p>Warner fought on, reaching 50 off 72 balls, with six fours and one six, periodically stretching out to thrash or pummel a loose ball to the fence, crouched very deep in his crease, reminiscent at times of Gary Ballance’s much more frightening Australian cousin.</p> \n<p>Mark Wood bowled well, producing some genuine skimming pace off that somersaulting tumbler’s run-up. But it was Moeen Ali who finally got Warner just before lunch with a straight ball that scuttled into his pads.</p> \n<p>Broad returned after lunch to remove Australia’s captain and vice-captain. His three wickets for 39 might easily have been five.</p> \n<p>More encouraging for England will be the unrelenting skill and urgency of their senior fast bowlers; not quite the pace like fire of the last Ashes series, but a more carefully-wrought, English-style destruction through high-pressure movement and accuracy that Australia must now look to counter.</p> \n<p><strong>Most wickets in fourth innings in winning Tests for England </strong></p> \n<p><strong>37 at 20.91 </strong>Stuart Broad</p> \n<p><strong>36 at 24.22</strong> Jimmy Anderson</p> \n<p><strong>35 at 15.77</strong> Bob Willis</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436641805405/Stuart-Broad-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stuart Broad celebrates with Jos Buttler after the dismissal of Steven Smith.

But he is struggling, under pressure for his place from Mitchell Marsh and retaining it for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/england-win-ashes-opener-as-stuart-broad-breaks-australias-top-order\" title=\"\">this first Test</a> on reputation rather than performance. In the first innings, though, when he had made 30, Broad had pinned him on the crease, the ball thundering into the massive magnet that is his front pad. He reviewed the lbw decision – of course he did – and, as happens more often than not, it was in vain. Now, in this second innings, Australia were struggling for survival, and Watson’s career was on the line.</p> \n<p>He made 19 unspectacular runs, trying so hard to play straight rather than around his front pad as the downfall of the lbw laureate so often suggests. Alastair Cook set three slips and a gully. But, for good measure, there were three close fielders on the drive, one on the off and two to leg, one of them almost standing on the cut strip. If you want to get the ball away, Cook was saying, you are going to have to hit across the line. Just once Anderson was belted back down the ground to the boundary, too straight and firm for anyone to stop and Ben Stokes was pulled dismissively to square leg for a second four. It all looked a struggle, a voice in his head telling him to play straight, keep the pad out of the way. After 57 previous deliveries, came the inevitable.</p> \n<p>Mark Wood, already a star in this new England team, slanted one into him, the bat came around his pad as he looked to angle the ball away and it thudded into it. The appeal was wholehearted and vociferous, the response of Marais Erasmus almost preordained, and with it Watson’s reaction.</p> \n<p>In the media centre, the universal plea came for him to review it, maybe for the last time in his Test career. The advice from the non-striker, Mitchell Johnson, may well have been not to bother but such was the situation that he had little option, even if it might have been for old times sake. So he did, grinning sheepishly as he did so. Maybe he could put DRS after his name. In the press box, arms went up gleefully. Then came the drama: the bowler had not overstepped, and nor did the batsman feather the ball on to his pad. Finally, trial by the automated decision review system: red light was followed by another, and then the orange umpire’s call. The ball would have been taking a big chunk out of a chocolate leg stump and Watson turned to trudge resignedly from the field, lbw for the 29th time. “Cheerio, cheerio, cheerio,” chanted the crowd. Someone posted a picture on Twitter of a Hawk-Eye screen grab captioned “Shane Watson’s passport photograph”: genius. Perhaps if the decision is taken to end his career he will review that as well.</p> \n<p>The opprobrium heaped on Cardiff before the match had begun was largely unwarranted and, if the pitch has been slower than some might like, it suited the home side and the first three innings were scored at four runs per over or more: it has been an enthralling match and supported to the full. Before play, the crowds had filled the coffee shops near the castle and the crocodile of spectators wound through the gardens and along the path by the Taff to the Swalec Stadium.</p> \n<p>Most press boxes these days have excellent views but as much atmosphere as the moon, so while it is easy to watch the match it is difficult to feel it. But go down one floor from this one and there is an open terrace from which to watch and it lends a different perspective. There is a hum between deliveries, gathering noise as the bowler runs in and there was an explosion of sound as five Australia wickets fell in the half-hour either side of lunch.</p> \n<p>For most of the first hour, though, there were mostly gasps, as the new ball darted and jagged past probing blades without finding the edge. A wicket seemed likely every ball but never came. In the third over, Chris Rogers got a thick edge to Anderson and the ball flew to the left of Joe Root at third slip but, whereas England’s catching had been exceptional otherwise, he could only parry this so that Rogers escaped. Those at third slip on both teams have been standing closer than normal, the slips tending to be <em>en &eacute;chelon</em> rather than in an arc, and this was no exception. But this was the new ball, which will always go through a little quicker and come faster from the bat: he may have been too close. Root lay prone as the crowd groaned: was it going to be this sort of a day?</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/11/stuart-broads-urgency-and-precision-win-vital-duel-with-david-warner\" title=\"\">Broad bowled magnificently</a>, as he had done throughout the match. This is a bowler who sometimes slumbers only to wake and deliver devastating spells; but that was not the case here, hitting the splice more than anyone and always challenging. He has never bowled better.</p> \n<p>Somehow Rogers and David Warner, a pair of left-handers, had survived until Broad went round the wicket to the former, moved one away and Ian Bell took the catch at bootlace height, low enough for the batsman to delay his walk back while the umpires checked the legitimacy.

These are, indeed, heady days for the England captain, who made good on his pre-match promise to empower, not inhibit, this attacking young side.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/11/england-win-ashes-opener-as-stuart-broad-breaks-australias-top-order\" title=\"\">This early victory</a> in the head-to-head represents something of a shock. His counterpart, after all, arrived on these shores as the funkmeister general – an escalation from the early summer grooves of Brendon McCullum and one which, it was said, would once again show Cook up as a roundhead to the Australian’s cavalier.</p> \n<p>And yet in Cardiff Clarke cut a strangely anonymous figure, meekly swishing the irresistible Stuart Broad on four to Ben Stokes at backward point to complete his contribution in a Test match to forget; his 11th defeat overseas draws him level with his predecessor Ricky Ponting and puts him five short of the overall record held by New Zealand’s Stephen Fleming.</p> \n<p>The eve of the first day saw Clarke announce – <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/42N-P3jdaL/?taken-by=michaelclarkeofficial\" title=\"\">via social media, naturally</a> – the happy news that he and his wife, Kyly, are expecting their first child, and the early signs are that this tour could provide the perfect preparation for the inevitable sleepless nights and messy situations that await. The issues are stacking up for him after four days of cricket.</p> \n<p>Clarke’s list of problems might not stretch to 99. But a Mitch is certainly one – if not two – with the most effective weapon in his armoury, Mitchell Starc, set to provide a will-he-won’t-he storyline before Thursday’s second Test at Lord’s with an ankle issue that flared up on the first day and has seen him bowl with a grimace ever since.</p> \n<p>The left-armer required pain-numbing cortisone injections to get through the 16 overs he bowled in England’s second innings and, given his history of problems in the area that has seen him require surgery, the 25-year-old’s retention would be a high-risk strategy. Peter Siddle, waiting in the wings, is a worthy competitor but a blunter blade.</p> \n<p>This in turn puts greater onus on his fellow left-armer Mitchell Johnson, who does not have the bouncy Australia soil that made him unplayable 18 months ago and shipped 180 runs for his two wickets in Cardiff. Clarke’s insurance policy, Ryan Harris, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/ryan-harris-australia-cricket-retirement-knee-injury-ashes\" title=\"\">has already hobbled into retirement</a>, with the one-time wonderkid Pat Cummins, his replacement, touching two years since his last first-class match.</p> \n<p>Four days in and Australian voices can already be heard questioning whether this is one tour too many for the 37-year-old wicketkeeper Brad Haddin. His stone-handed second-ball drop of Joe Root on the first day denied his side a scoreboard reading 43 for four – altering the course of the match as Root went on to make 134. Meanwhile his batting has averaged 15 in his last 21 innings, his latest shot being a duffed heave off Moeen that was gobbled up, at the second attempt, by Cook. And then there is the Shane Watson conundrum.</p> \n<p>Watson is a talented all-round cricketer who appears a victim of other people’s expectations. But he is also one who possesses such a glaring hole in his armoury in Test cricket that England probably do not feel the need to discuss the plan any more. Bowl full and straight and the thud of leather on pad will come. It has worked 14 times before, after all, with Mark Wood the latest to exploit the glitch.</p> \n<p>Can Australia’s selectors call time on the 34-year-old’s Test career so soon into an Ashes tour and, in doing so, lose face with the concession that they made a dud call in overlooking Mitchell Marsh, the younger and more in-form all-rounder? Leaving out Watson and Haddin, the latter understudied by Peter Nevill, who averaged 76 in the most recent Sheffield Shield, will surely be mulled over late at night.</p> \n<p>They must also challenge the batsmen who all made starts in Cardiff but failed to convert. When Johnson, a worthy No8, is second highest scorer with a gunslinger’s 77 in a doomed cause, there is significant work to be done. Shaun Marsh sits in reserve but his 15 first-class centuries in 15 years do not shout for change.</p> \n<p>Arriving soon is Clarke’s old friend Shane Warne, who will resume his position as Cook’s most strident critic up in the commentary box after missing the Cardiff Test to attend a poker tournament. There is plenty for the pair to discuss.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436639093155/Michael-Clarke--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Michael Clarke looks dejected after being dismissed by Stuart Broad on the fourth day of the first Test.

It’s something we want to carry on. We want to make people proud of us like that.</p> \n<p>“There’s a real buzz around this series. We’re getting a lot of interview requests and we want to play in front of big crowds and really get the public behind us.</p> \n<p>“When you look on social media and see that people are not just excited about the men’s Ashes but also the women’s Ashes, it is really exciting for us as a group of players.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/charlotte-edwards-england-womens-ashes-cricket\">Charlotte Edwards: England will take attacking cue from men in Women’s Ashes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Greenway is one of England’s most experienced batters, having started her international career 12 years ago. She has won 121 one-day international caps and has played a key role in England’s victories in the last two Ashes series, including a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/aug/29/england-women-ashes-twenty20-australia\" title=\"\">match-winning 64-ball 80 not out</a> in the Twenty20 success which sealed the inaugural multi-format series in 2013.</p> \n<p>She is an elegant batsman who is known for her deft placement and athletic running between the wickets but she, like Charlotte Edwards, her captain, believes England will display a more attacking and aggressive style of cricket in this series.</p> \n<p>“It’s been something we have been consciously working on since we got back from New Zealand and something we have been practising in our warm-up games. That sort of attacking mindset will really move our cricket forward. Seeing some of the scores being made in the men’s game, it just makes you think how much we can increase our scores in our matches.”</p> \n<p>It’s been just over a year since the England and Wales Cricket Board gave full-time professional contracts to 18 players and Greenway believes we will start to see the difference that has made.</p> \n<p>“We have much more time to train together and focus on our cricket now but just as importantly we have opportunity for some down time. When we weren’t professional we obviously had to balance our cricket with work or study and it was a real challenge to fit everything in and sometimes that took its toll. We will start to see the long term benefits soon.”</p> \n<p>This Ashes has all the makings of a hugely entertaining series. “I don’t think it’s too dramatic a statement to say that the 2015 Women’s Ashes contest is possibly the most eagerly anticipated series in the history of international women’s cricket,” said the ECB’s director of women’s cricket, Clare Connor, at the squad announcement.</p> \n<p>The women’s game is developing at an extraordinary pace. This is the first time ever, two fully professional teams will be competing with every ball live on television. Greenway is relishing the prospect.</p> \n<p>“Australia are a very good side, they’re obviously the World Cup holders and the World T20 champions but we have won the last two Ashes and we’re not going to let them go without a fight.</p> \n<p>“We will be doing everything that we can to make sure they stay in England and for the whole series to be televised is fantastic for women’s cricket and for women’s sport in general.</p> \n<p>“It’s a really big thing; as players this is what we play and train for - to show people what we can do and to continue to grow the support.”</p> \n<p>Greenway is known as one of the best fielders in women’s cricket. When asked about this her response was one you seldom hear from cricketers of either gender.</p> \n<p>“I just love fielding” she said “when I was growing up I used to be diving around the garden with my brother and sister as my dad whacked tennis balls at us, it is something that I have always loved doing. Not being a bowler I feel like it’s doubly important I contribute in the field.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/11/1436618872738/Lydia-Greenway-England-wo-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lydia Greenway is optimistic that England can win the women's Ashes for a third straight series.

And now, after just 15 days in the job, it would appear the standards expected by England’s head coach, Trevor Bayliss, have permeated through to his new team.</p> \n<p>During Australia’s first innings here in Cardiff, one which saw them fold in the face of relentless discipline – only one side seems to be grumbling about the surface so far – every catch went to hand and two can be filed in the top drawer. For many, this will of course be the expected benchmark for any international side; to praise fielders for taking chances is to applaud the pilot who lands the plane safely.</p> \n<p>Their adhesive paws in Cardiff thus far must been viewed in light of their early summer, however, one where 11 catches were grassed in the drawn Test series against New Zealand, costing an aggregate of 250 runs. Some 182 of these came in the series-levelling defeat at Headingley, only 17 fewer than the tourists’ ultimate margin of victory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/10/ashes-2015-england-v-australia-first-test-day-three-live\">Ashes 2015: England v Australia –&nbsp;first Test, day three –&nbsp;live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not all of those chances were regulation, but then neither were they here. Alastair Cook’s removal of David Warner at first slip that got the ball rolling on Thursday afternoon required a flying leap high to his right to hold on two-handed after Jimmy Anderson got one to nudge the edge of the left-hander’s meaty blade.</p> \n<p>Joe Root’s effort to wrap up the Australian innings on Friday morning was a frictionless dive low to his left at third slip after the Australian No10 Mitchell Starc took the ill-advised decision to attempt an expansive drive to a full and late outswinger from Anderson. It also provided the Yorkshireman a chance to remind his former county team-mate that a finger-to-the-lips send-off ain’t that funny when one is on the receiving end.</p> \n<p>In between we saw Cook snaffle a simple take off Steve Smith at short mid-on, Moeen Ali hold a smart return catch off Michael Clarke and Anderson make light work of Adam Voges’ mistimed drive at short extra-cover. Jos Buttler behind the stumps, who had predecessor Matt Prior join him and coach Bruce French for a pre-series session, held the two nicks that came his way.</p> \n<p>So what has occurred between Headingley and now? Well, Bayliss and a four-day training camp in Spain. With their hands slightly tied by facilities – and perhaps the excess baggage charges associated with a glut of kitbags – England opted to leave the batting equipment at home and keep the physical stuff to fitness and fielding.</p> \n<p>Perhaps a by-product of this focus, whether intended or not, was that batsmen in particular were unable to go into themselves and demand throwdown after throwdown. Instead, the only way to impress their new boss, and apologise to the fielding coach, Chris Taylor, for their early summer sloppiness, was to ace the drills in Almer&iacute;a, which took place every day of the trip.</p> \n<p>Bayliss also resisted the calls to sub Ian Bell out of second slip in favour of the Yorkshire regular Adam Lyth, despite three drops at Lord’s against New Zealand. This particular decision had the confidence of the individual factored in, as well as the technical side of things. And while nothing came his way during Australia’s first-innings demise, Bayliss may see Bell’s second-innings 60 – one which broke a binary run of form – as an indirect repayment of sorts.</p> \n<p>A head coach taking a keen interest in fielding is nothing new. But if Peter Moores was an energetic presence during the pre-play warm-ups, Bayliss is a looming one. Decked out in a floppy sunhat and with an air of Duncan Fetcher about him from a distance, the Australian spent Friday morning prowling on the touchline during the football warm-up, bat in hand, a pile of balls at feet ready for the proper preparation to begin; the homework that follows fun time. The players now know what he expects and so far, so very good.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436548072100/Joe-Root--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Joe Root takes a sharp chance to dismiss Australia's Mitchell Starc on day three of the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.
