Southern Rites, her new HBO documentary, details the town’s triumphs and tragedies in confronting its difficult history</p>","byline":"Ruth Spencer","body":"<p>Teenagers in Montgomery, Georgia celebrated their fifth integrated prom this year – thanks, in part, to photographer Gillian Laub who spent 12 years documenting the town’s struggle to confront deep-seated racial tensions – and ended up transforming the town through her images.</p> \n<p>In 2009, the New York Times Magazine <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/24/magazine/24prom-t.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\">published</a> a series of Laub’s photographs of Montgomery County high school’s racially segregated proms. The piece exposed what Laub calls the town’s “dark secret” and sparked a debate that eventually led to Montgomery County finally integrating prom. In 2011, Laub returned to document the historical event and learned that one of her previous subjects, a young black man, had been murdered. </p> \n<p>Now, Laub has turned her study of racial tensions in Montgomery County and the killing of Justin Patterson into a documentary. <a href=\"http://www.hbo.com/documentaries/southern-rites#/\">Southern Rites</a>, which airs on 18 May on HBO, explores the community’s struggle to move forward from its difficult past amid newfound tragedy. Musician John Legend produced the film. </p> \n<p>Ahead of Southern Rites’s debut, we spoke to Laub about the teenagers she met in Montgomery, how the residents have reacted to her project and what it’s been like to witness a town in transition. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ecd3431befd95fc11feb622b68c41fd638609a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4ecd3431befd95fc11feb622b68c41fd638609a2/0_34_9000_5400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parking lot of first Integrated Prom - Lyons, Georgia 2010\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Students walk through the parking lot outside the first integrated prom in Lyons, Georgia, in 2010</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gillian Laub</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<blockquote> \n <p>I photographed the segregated proms of 2009, and when the photos were published a lot of the white families resented me because I was exposing what felt like a dirty secret.</p> \n <p>When I came back, I had to go in front of parents and school administrators to explain and ask permission to photograph the first integrated prom.
