Recently I’ve enjoyed a plump beaujolais-like 2013 gamay from Robert S&eacute;rol in the southern C&ocirc;te Roannaise; a silky, light 2011 pinot noir from Vincent Pinard in Sancerre in the region’s centre, and a succulent 2011 take on the local grolleau from Clau de Nell in Anjou to the west. But the Loire’s red star is undoubtedly cabernet franc, with Domaine du Colombier’s Chinon a crisp, crunchy-fruited budget-friendly introduction.</p> \n<p><strong>Ch&acirc;teau de Hureau Tuffe Saumur-Champigny 2012 (&pound;14.35, </strong><a href=\"http://www.slurp.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Slurp</strong></a><strong>) </strong>What I like about Loire cabernet franc is its inherent lightness and freshness, both of which make it a versatile food-match. I’m thinking of salmon, as well as grilled meat. But with their distinctive mix of red fruit, graphite, floral fragrance, acidity and chalky tannic bite, and their generally low alcohol, the wines take well to being chilled and served with cold meats and cheese, too. Those closest to my personal ideal of cab franc are both from the Saumur-Champigny appellation: the raspberry-scented Domaine Filliatreau Classique 2013 and the perfectly modulated cherries of Ch&acirc;teau du Hureau’s 2012.</p> \n<p><strong>Charles Joguet Cuvee Terroir, Chinon France 2012 (&pound;13.80, </strong><a href=\"http://www.tanners-wines.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Tanners Wines</strong></a><strong>)</strong> Working at the northern limit of red-wine production, the Loire’s cabernet franc growers have in the past struggled to get sufficiently ripe grapes, leading to an aggressive tang of green pepper and lack of substance. But while the wines are never going to be big blockbusters, I found little evidence of those herbaceous qualities in those I tasted. And even in difficult vintages, such as 2012 and 2013, the better growers, such as Charles Joguet, are capable of making complex, elegant wines such as Clos de la Dioterie 2012 as well as vibrant, limpid reds like Cuv&eacute;e Terroir.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540948987/FRANCE-LOIRE-VALLEY-CHATE-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reflected glory: Chateau Chambord, one of the many grand buildings dotted along the Loire.

Oldman chuckled. “Only in Colorado,” he said in reference to the state’s recently relaxed cannabis regulations.</p> \n<p>The tasting continued through epic wines from Italy, Australia and California’s Napa Valley. As the vibe loosened further, thanks to the 7,900ft elevation, the early hour and the high-octane red wines, Oldman unsheathed a saber. “What’s the best time for champagne?” he bellowed again. “Always!” his audience replied, and a massive three-litre bottle of NV Champagne Barons de Rothschild Brut appeared onstage. </p> \n<p>Begin with bubbles and close with bubbles.

But Reg Drury, who has died aged 76, was a brewer of the “old school”.</p> \n<p>He worked for Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner in Chiswick, west London, for 40 years, ending as director of brewing. All who met him found him charming, unassuming, patient and willing to spend time discussing beer, its components, flavours and complexities. Nevertheless, there was quiet passion and determination under the donnish exterior. Reg loved cask-conditioned beer – real ale – and he was determined to both save it and perfect it when he arrived at Fuller’s in 1959.</p> \n<p>The 1960s and 70s were a time of turmoil in the industry. Dozens of old regional breweries disappeared as a series of takeovers and mergers created six national brewing giants. They were determined to supply a new type of beer – keg beer – to the thousands of pubs they owned. The Big Six, as they were called, had little time for finicky cask beer. It was perishable, and a cask had to be finished within a few days once it was broached. Keg beer, on the other hand – chilled, filtered, pasteurised and artificially carbonated – offered the certainties of long shelf-life and bigger profits.</p> \n<p>Reg was aware of the dilemma facing brewers of traditional ale when he joined Fuller’s. He had trained at the acclaimed school of brewing at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He not only knew how to brew beer of all types, but was skilled also in maintaining the consistency and quality of the end product.</p> \n<p>It was difficult to achieve consistency at Fuller’s at the time. Brewing had been going on at the Thames-side site for 350 years, with the partnership of Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner dating from 1845. Cask beer was produced in open fermenters, some of which were more than 100 years old and leaked. Finding a clear and tasty pint of Fuller’s cask ale in a pub was something of a gamble.</p> \n<p>Backed by vast advertising budgets, keg beers such as Watneys Red Barrel, Double Diamond and Worthington E became market leaders, refashioning the market and threatening the future of ale brewers. The directors of Fuller’s toyed with the idea of going over entirely to keg beer and in 1976 installed modern, enclosed conical fermenters to make it.</p> \n<p>It was widely believed in the industry at the time that real ale could not be brewed in conicals because the special yeast cultures used would be adversely affected by both the shape of the vessels and the colder temperatures employed. Reg experimented with the new vessels and came to the conclusion that if you adjusted the temperatures and regularly used fresh batches of ale yeast, it would be perfectly possible to produce cask beer in them.</p> \n<p>His work in perfecting such key brands as Chiswick Bitter, London Pride and Extra Special Bitter (ESB) in the conical vessels turned them into successful and greatly admired beers. Each has been named champion beer of Britain in the Campaign for Real Ale’s annual awards. ESB won the title in 1978, 1981 and 1985 and has also won the strong ale category in the championship seven times, more than any other beer.</p> \n<p>Son of Lt-Col Hugh Drury and his wife Geraldine, Reg was born in Cairo, where his father was stationed in the army. After the second world war, the Drury family returned to Britain and settled in Surrey. Reg went to Lancing college in West Sussex, where he developed an enduring love for classical music and opera, and became an accomplished pianist. From Lancing, he went to study brewing at Heriot-Watt and then joined Fuller’s as a junior brewer. He became head brewer and eventually director of brewing, with a seat on the board.</p> \n<p>Reg’s dedicated skill in turning Fuller’s into a thoroughly modern brewery that is also steeped in tradition has turned the company into one of the most successful independent producers in Britain.</p> \n<p>He was also an innovator. As John Keeling, his successor as director of brewing, says, he dug deep into the Fuller’s recipe books to revive such old styles as London Porter, and he also had the foresight to develop bottle-conditioned beers – beers with active yeast – that will age and improve over several years.</p> \n<p>When he launched Fuller’s “1845” ale in 1995 and Vintage Ale two years later, sales of bottled beer were in decline. But Reg believed that naturally conditioned beers, with rich malt and hop flavours, would appeal to discerning drinkers. He wanted good beer to be treated with the reverence given to wine. His prescience can be judged by the boom in bottled beers in recent years: it is now a vibrant sector with several thousand beers produced in bottle-conditioned form.</p> \n<p>Reg was a devoted family man. He ran a succession of narrowboats on the English canals, enjoyed walking holidays in Scotland, Wales and Norway, and dedicated himself to a model railway at his home.</p> \n<p>But brewing remained his passion. When he retired from Fuller’s, he became an assessor for Cask Marque, the industry-funded group that monitors the quality of real ale in the nation’s pubs. Statistics released just a few days after his death showed that sales of cask beer, the style he helped improve and foster, have grown appreciably in 2014 and 2015. Reg was good beer’s best friend.</p> \n<p>He is survived by his wife, Sarah, whom he married in 1974, and their children, Jonathan and Fiona.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Reginald Hugh Drury, brewer, born 10 March 1939; died 7 June 2015</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434635307503/Reg-Drury-former-head-bre-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters Photograph: family picture","credit":"family picture","altText":"Reg Drury, former head brewer at Fuller's","cleanCaption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters Photograph: family picture"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T15:30:18Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T15:33:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[{"name":"Roger Protz","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/roger-protz"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Beer","Food & drink","Life and style","Food & drink industry","London","Pubs"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/beer","webTitle":"Beer"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"business/fooddrinks","webTitle":"Food & drink industry"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/pubs","webTitle":"Pubs"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Roger Protz","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/roger-protz"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/18/reg-drury","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4av64","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/18/reg-drury","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/18/reg-drury"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434635307503/Reg-Drury-former-head-bre-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters ","credit":"Family picture","altText":"Reg Drury, former head brewer at Fuller's","cleanCaption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters "}},"importance":4,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434635307503/Reg-Drury-former-head-bre-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters Photograph: family picture","credit":"family picture","altText":"Reg Drury, former head brewer at Fuller's","cleanCaption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters Photograph: family picture"}}]},{"title":"The Hunter Valley wine region's cellar doors: eight of the best","rawTitle":"The Hunter Valley wine region's cellar doors: eight of the best","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/jun/17/the-hunter-valley-wine-regions-cellar-doors-eight-of-the-best","title":"The Hunter Valley wine region's cellar doors: eight of the best","trailText":"Just two hours north of Sydney, this popular region has scores of wineries to visit.

Seasonal produce like avocados, lemons and limes, pumpkins, watermelons, peaches and figs are also sold in the cellar door. But the wine is why you’re here. You can lean against the heavy timber bar or sit down amongst the barrels and drink Hunter wines, made and grown in the same place by the same family for more than the last 100 years.

Today, the schoolhouse has been transformed into a cellar door, where staff won’t give you detention if you’ve failed to learn the difference between a primary and secondary fermentation. <br /></p> \n<p>The cellar door is always busy on weekends with people tasting classic Hunter Valley wines with a contemporary twist. You will probably learn something about wine too, especially if winemaker Matt Burton and his offsider Nick are around. Ask to taste the Wild Semillon and new Indomitus range.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Bimbadgen Estate – 790 McDonalds Road, Pokolbin, NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Bimbadgen is an Indigenous word that means ‘many great views’, and that’s exactly what you’ll get when you visit this cellar door. Grab a glass of their viognier or shiraz and look out over panoramic views of the Brokenback range to the south and Barrington Tops to the north. Ask to taste the Estate Chardonnay and Estate Viognier.</p> \n<p><strong>Hart &amp; Hunter – 463 Deaseys Road, Pokolbin NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Tucked away on Deaseys road, you’ll find one of the Hunter’s newest wine labels. Hart &amp; Hunter don’t only have a great taste for wine, but music as well. Their sole focus is on Hunter Valley fruit, so you won’t find a sauvignon blanc here – just tremendous semillon, chardonnay and shiraz, native to the region. Ask to taste all of them!</p> \n<p><strong>Macquariedale –170 Sweetwater Road, Belford NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Biodynamic duo Ross and Derice McDonald were one of the first Hunter Valley winegrowers to be certified organic. They also grow and produce delicious garlic and olive oil on their Rothbury property, but it’s the wines that will give you a reason to stay. You can taste whites and reds in their gorgeous cellar door at the top of the hill while you watch the sun set over the Brokenback on a crisp, wintry afternoon. Ask to taste the verdelho and Thomas Shiraz.</p> \n<p><strong>Oakvale – 1596 Broke Road, Pokolbin NSW</strong></p> \n<p>The Oakvale label has been growing grapes and making wine in the Hunter Valley since the 1890s. second-generation winemaker Bob Elliot used to sell wine to Maurice O’Shea from up the road at Mount Pleasant. Today, the Becker family name is above the cellar door and their respect for Oakvale’s rich past is more evident than ever. Son James Becker recently took over the winemaking reins full time. He has a not-so-secret love for Hunter chardonnay, which is deliciously revealed in every glass. Ask to taste the Ablington Chardonnay and shiraz.</p> \n<p><br /><strong>Krinklewood – 712 Wollombi Road, Broke NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Krinklewood is one of the most peaceful destinations for wine in the whole Hunter Valley. Their cellar door is nestled beneath the foothills of the Brokenback range, in the sub-region of Broke, one of the region’s most charming places to visit. Echoing somewhere in France, Krinklewood’s vineyard has more than just grapevines. The sheep eat the weeds, the worms turn the soil, and Minty the dog stands watchful over all of it. Ask to taste the Francesca Ros&eacute; and Spiders Run White.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376464639582/A-vineyard-in-the-Hunter--011.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"TOURISM AUSTRALIA/PR IMAGE","altText":"A vineyard in the Hunter Valley ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: TOURISM AUSTRALIA/PR IMAGE"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a2985c4261f839df33f76c3af0b78f0997ea4515/0_0_2958_1777/2958.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1777,"width":2958,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There are more than 120 vineyards in the Hunter Valley region.

But there are some dishes that as a nation we recognise as quintessentially Australian – and they’ve started to pop up on menus from Brixton to Brooklyn.</p> \n<p>Tori Haschka, author of A Suitcase and a Spatula: Recipes and Stories from Around the World, says Australia’s spreading culinary influence can be put down to Australians’ love of travel.</p> \n<p>Wherever we go, she says, we like to share what’s best about our country. “That includes our fresh and sometimes laconic approach to food,” she says. “There’s a great focus on texture in Australian food; from the silkiness of the cap of milk in a flat white, the plushness of smashed avocado on crunchy toast or the bristle of coconut on a lamington.”</p> \n<p>Ken Burgin, restaurant consultant at Profitable Hospitality, says looking closely at other countries highlights what makes Australian dishes special. </p> \n<p>“I’ve just been in Italy for a month and it seems nothing there ever changes – good in some ways, and quite dull after a while,” he says. “Maybe our careful experiments with honest ingredients are what’s defining a distinctive Australian cuisine?”</p> \n<p>Here are five Aussie dishes and beverages now taking the world by storm:<br /></p> \n<h2>1. Flat white</h2> \n<p>Australia’s favourite coffee is fast usurping the cappuccino and latte as the drink of choice at cafes around the world. You can now order a flat white at Fondation Cafe in Paris and Little Collins in New York. The abundance of flat whites is such that <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3042927/why-starbuckss-new-drink-the-flat-white-is-made-of-hot-marketing-and-foam\">FastCompany</a> has dubbed the flat white “the latest must-sip beverage”. </p> \n<p> Now even Starbucks in the US is on the bandwagon, serving flat whites to millions of bewildered Americans who are not even sure what a flat white is (read <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/06/starbucks-flat-white-australia-coffee\">David Marr’s review</a> of the Starbuck’s flat white). Its popularity is such that some outlets are reported to have taken cappuccinos off the menu. In an act of community service Australia’s Hugh Jackman tried to explain the flat white as “like a latte with a little less milk and more espresso”. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33a3d539aca98dcb80979d3d3e8e362dcd519c0a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/33a3d539aca98dcb80979d3d3e8e362dcd519c0a/0_0_5100_3523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The classic flat white – started in Australia, and has taken over the world\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The classic flat white.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Cavalier/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>2. Smashed avocado on toast<br /></h2> \n<p>It’s rare these days to find a cafe in Australia that doesn’t serve smashed avocado (usually with chunky salt, pepper, lemon and perhaps feta). Now the rest of the world has woken up to the joys of “nature’s butter”. You can order “smashed avocado with streaky bacon” at Lantana in London or avocado smash with poached eggs, ricotta and radishes at the Cupping Room in Hong Kong. </p> \n<p>Diners love avocado for its health benefits and creamy taste while the appeal to chefs and cafe owners everywhere is immediately obvious: avocado smash is low on labour and high on profit margins. All you need is a fork and a squeeze of lemon – and a perfect avocado – and you’re in business.</p> \n<p>The smashing refers to mashing it up roughly with a fork, as opposed to slicing it or puree-ing it.</p> \n<h2>3. Sticky date pudding<br /></h2> \n<p>Sticky toffee pudding is a traditional British dessert beloved of gastropubs around the UK, but the Australian twist – sticky date pudding – is becoming an increasingly popular variation. </p> \n<p>It’s worth noting that some British sticky toffee puddings actually contain dates but they are finely diced, disguising their presence, whereas in Australia the date is loud and proud. It’s irrelevant, anyway, as everyone knows sticky date pudding isn’t really about the dates at all but the lashings of caramel sauce it comes smothered in. </p> \n<p>The Corner House in Bali serves up sticky date pudding with caramel and salty butter ice cream while Five Leaves in New York offers sticky date more traditionally, with the sole accompaniment of vanilla ice cream. </p> \n<p>Hashka says Australia’s reinvention of the dish has eclipsed the original’s popularity. “Sticky date is a much more practical moniker,” she says. “Of course it’s going to be sticky if it’s got toffee in it it. </p> \n<p>“But if there are dates in there, best let us know about them up front. It’s a straight down the line approach to food that makes sense.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b39eda5f1816a5de76a2ee4a35a94cce7877655f\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b39eda5f1816a5de76a2ee4a35a94cce7877655f/0_0_4064_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky date pudding with icecream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sticky date pudding with ice cream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4. Corn fritters</h2> \n<p>Bill Granger has built an international empire on the back of his sweet corn breakfast fritters and other cafe owners have taken note.</p> \n<p>Granger’s version is made with flour, eggs, milk, fresh corn, herbs and a pinch of paprika, delivering a savoury dish with pops of sweetness from the corn. But you can find any number of interpretations of the corn fritter on cafe menus from Lantana in London to <a href=\"http://www.bluestonelaneny.com/\">Blue Stone Lane in New York</a>.</p> \n<p>For Nicholas Stone, Bluestone Lane’s owner, the corn fritter is a “quintessentially Aussie” dish. Bluestone Lane serves its fritters with with avo smash, smoked salmon, poached egg, beetroot relish and rocket. He says there’s no “exact science” behind New Yorker’s sudden insatiable desire for the corn fritter but thinks it coincides with an appreciation for more sophisticated cafe menu items among New Yorkers.</p> \n<p>“This is quite a non-traditional brunch dish that they are quite curious about,” he says. “It’s very aesthetically pleasing and delicious.” In the Instagram age that does count.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"787f80618495a03d2ef46db874d0aafd0c3218e5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433897430767/a88bc2a9-ce8c-4182-a57f-473b43daaf5a-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Corn fritters – good with eggs or as a snack later in the day.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corn fritters – good with eggs or as a snack later in the day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><p>5. Lamingtons</p></h2> \n<p>The delights of fluffy sponge cake, jammy filling, chocolate coating and dessicated coconut are going global. Now lamingtons are on offer at the Two Blur Guys cafe in Singapore while in London it’s hard to avoid Australia’s favourite cake. It’s a must-order item at Ozone Espresso in Shoreditch, east London, and Kaffeine in Fitzrovia in central London, doesn’t just sell lamingtons – it sells “pimped-up cushions of sponge”. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-828515c8-f9bb-4c24-bba5-d34932842a80\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434326775981/9dcb6989-b75f-4742-a0a8-be1dc05fae8d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chocolate lamingtons – delicious cushions of sponge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chocolate lamingtons – delicious cushions of sponge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Whitaker for Observer Food Monthly</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><br /></h2>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b1976999ced1910e697400b515710a19303cf085/0_38_720_432/720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":432,"width":720,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"bonappetit.com","altText":"Avocado on toast.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: bonappetit.com"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/33a3d539aca98dcb80979d3d3e8e362dcd519c0a/0_0_5100_3523/5100.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3523,"width":5100,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The classic flat white.
