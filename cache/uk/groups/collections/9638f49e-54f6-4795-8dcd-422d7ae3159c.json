Here are three very different grapes for you to sample. Think of it as a small show of solidarity</p>","byline":"David Williams","body":"<p><strong>Thiasos White, Peloponnese, Greece 2013 (&pound;7.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.winerack.co.uk/\"><strong>Wine Rack</strong></a><strong>)</strong> Amid the unceasingly distressing headlines coming out of Greece, it’s not surprising that some modestly good news about the country’s wine industry has struggled to get much air-time. After all, a story along the lines of “small European country’s wines show steady improvement and increasing acceptance overseas” is never going to compete for drama with the high-stakes realpolitik and socially corrosive effects of the Grexit saga. But it would take the heart of a victim of Medusa not to be cheered by the idea that Greek wines are both better and easier to find in the UK than they’ve ever been. And the Thiasos unoaked blend of white Greek varieties roditis and moschofilero is a breezy, floral, gently spicy, modestly priced way of showing some fellow feeling.</p> \n<p><strong>Hatzidakis Nikteri, Santorini, Greece 2012 (&pound;22.50, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bbr.com/?gclid=CNqo66Krt8YCFYGWtAodOzEIww\"><strong>Berry Bros &amp; Rudd</strong></a><strong>)</strong> One thing I like about the Greek wines I’ve tasted recently is the way their producers draw deep on tradition without being slavishly in hoc to it. A wine such as Domaine Gerovassiliou’s Malagousia 2013, (also at Wine Rack, &pound;16.99), for example, is made from a rediscovered ancient, local grape variety (malagousia) in Epanomi near the city of Thessaloniki. But it’s made in a particularly clean, pure modern way that makes for a quite thrilling dry white mix of citrusy tang and plumper apricot fleshiness. Similarly, with Nikteri, top producer Hatzidakis harks back to the night-harvested white wines of Santorini’s past, cold-fermenting the island’s intense lemon-and-mineral-flavoured assyrtiko variety in temperature-controlled tanks, and then ageing it in barrel to add a touch of savoury richness.</p> \n<p><strong>Thymiopoulos Jeunes Vignes, Naoussa, Greece 2013 (from &pound;10.50, </strong><a href=\"http://www.thewinesociety.com\"><strong>The Wine Society</strong></a><strong>; </strong><a href=\"http://shop.vinoteca.co.uk\"><strong>Vinoteca</strong></a><strong>; </strong><a href=\"http://www.theatreofwine.com\"><strong>Theatre of Wine</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Greece’s white wines, both dry and sweet, have so far left the most memorable mark on my palate (the golden Samos Nectar 2009, available for &pound;10.60 at London independent Theatre of Wine, is an exquisite, aptly named example of the latter). I’ve found less finesse in the reds, but that’s not to say they can’t be attractively vibrant and – with their grip and acidity – food-friendly in a way that resembles many Italian wines. Marks &amp; Spencer has a good example of what I mean, in the vivid cherry of Mitravelas Estate Red on Black Agiorgitiko 2013 (&pound;9). Even better is Thymiopoulos’ “young vines” xynomavro, which adds a bit of dried herb, spice and grit to the succulent mix.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435665509947/wines-from-greece-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greece is the word: three unusual bottles for you to test your taste buds with.","credit":"PR","altText":"wines from greece","cleanCaption":"Greece is the word: three unusual bottles for you to test your taste buds with."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T05:00:06Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T05:00:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":7,"contributors":[{"name":"David Williams","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/david-williams"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Greek food and drink","Wine","Food & drink","Life and style","Greece"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/greek","webTitle":"Greek food and drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"David Williams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/david-williams"}}],"series":{"title":"David Williams's wines of the week","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/david-williams-wines-of-the-week"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/05/greek-wines-to-try-david-williams","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a937","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/05/greek-wines-to-try-david-williams","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/05/greek-wines-to-try-david-williams"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435665509947/wines-from-greece-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greece is the word: three unusual bottles for you to test your taste buds with","credit":"PR","altText":"three wines from greece","cleanCaption":"Greece is the word: three unusual bottles for you to test your taste buds with"}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Review"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435665509947/wines-from-greece-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greece is the word: three unusual bottles for you to test your taste buds with.","credit":"PR","altText":"wines from greece","cleanCaption":"Greece is the word: three unusual bottles for you to test your taste buds with."}}]},{"title":"Karam Sethi’s recipes for a family feast","rawTitle":"Karam Sethi’s recipes for a family feast","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/04/karam-sethi-family-feast","title":"Karam Sethi’s recipes for a family feast","trailText":"‘My perfect summer lunch is a big boisterous family affair with everybody chipping in’","standFirst":"<p>‘My perfect summer lunch is a big, boisterous family affair with everybody chipping in’</p>","byline":"Karam Sethi","body":"<p>My perfect summer lunch is a big, boisterous family affair – al fresco, if the weather’s good – with everybody chipping in.

To be honest, though, there’s no need to be too precious: any good shell-on prawn, langoustine or even lobster tail would work. The French and English mustard in the marinade are not quite as strange a choice of ingredient as they might at first seem: mustard seed is one of the mainstays of Indian cooking. Serves six (ie, one big prawn each).</p> \n<p><strong>2 tbsp oil<br />1 tbsp mustard seeds <br />1 tbsp finely sliced curry leaf <br />1 tbsp wholegrain Dijon mustard<br />1 tbsp English mustard<br />1 tbsp mustard oil<br />1 tsp ginger and garlic paste (puree 2 garlic cloves and a 4cm piece of ginger with a little water, and store in the fridge) <br />1 tsp salt<br />&frac12; tsp turmeric powder<br />1 tsp Kashmiri chilli powder<br />1 tbsp chopped coriander stem<br />6 tiger prawns</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oil in a pan, add the mustard seeds and fry until they start to crack. Turn off the heat, then stir in the curry leaf. Combine with all the remaining ingredients except the prawns, then smear the mixture all over them.</p> \n<p>Barbecue the prawns (or cook under a very hot grill) until charred, and serve hot. I like to serve them with a puffed rice garnish, not least for the texture it adds: heat half a tablespoon of oil in a pan, add half a teaspoon each of turmeric and red chilli powder, and a pinch of salt, then add six tablespoons of puffed rice (mamra) and toss for a minute. Take off the heat, stir in a handful of mustard cress, a tablespoon of finely diced cucumber and half a teaspoon of chaat masala. Scatter over the prawns before serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>Mango shrikhand</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9cda46862bacf99c2b7828bc36b3d37f746a87ff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435681628221/a8c6e67a-048c-489e-80e7-3d3dfc89da86-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Karam Sethi's mango shrikhand\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karam Sethi’s mango shrikhand: ‘One of the tastiest of all summer desserts.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the simplest of all summer desserts, and one of the tastiest, too.

Food styling: Cara Hobday</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ideally at the weekends, I’ll be surrounded by friends – the ones who aren’t shy of a good lunch. And I can think of no better summer lunch dish than this, served with big bowls of summery veg. (You’ll need to start on the rabbit legs a day ahead; it’s all of five minutes’ extra work, but if you can’t face it, buy a big jar or tin of confit duck instead, though it won’t be quite the same.) There should be a gluggable red wine on the table, too, with a little chill on it. And lunch should go on – calmly – for hours. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>4 rabbit hind legs<br />Sea salt and black pepper<br />3 or 4 sprigs fresh thyme<br />Duck, goose or pork fat<br />Chicken and rabbit bones (or just chicken), with stock vegetables of your choice (leek, carrot, turnip, perhaps)<br />12 shallots, peeled but left whole<br />12 small turnips (if possible with tops, cut off but reserved)<br />12 baby carrots, green tops trimmed off</strong></p> \n<p><strong><br /></strong>For the a&iuml;oli<br /><strong>20 garlic cloves <br />Sea salt and black pepper<br />2 free-range egg yolks<br />At least 300ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />Juice of 2 lemons (you may not need it all, but it’s best to have it to hand)</strong></p> \n<p>First, confit the rabbit. In a plastic, glass or china container, scantily scatter salt, pepper and a couple of sprigs of thyme. Lay in the rabbit legs in a single layer and scatter more salt, pepper and thyme on top. Cover, then refrigerate for 24 hours.</p> \n<p>The next day, there should be a salty puddle in your container. Remove the legs and brush off any salt, pepper and thyme. Dry the legs with a clean towel, place in an oven dish or pan and add enough duck, goose or pork fat (or a combination) to submerge the legs. Cover with foil and cook in a medium oven until the flesh is giving but not falling apart – about two hours. Transfer the meat to a sealable glass, plastic or china container, then pour over the fat to cover. You can make this confit far in advance, in which case seal the container, leave it to cool, then refrigerate. Either way, make sure the legs are at room temperature before cooking them further.</p> \n<p>Make a stock with rabbit and/or chicken bones and the vegetables. Meanwhile, make the a&iuml;oli. Put the garlic in the chopping bowl of a food processor with a pinch of salt (this helps to break it up) and pepper, then whizz until finely pulped – this is important, because you do not want garlic chippings in the a&iuml;oli. With the motor running, add the egg yolks, let them meet the garlic for a moment, then slowly add the oil in a gentle stream. The emulsion should safely hold up to 300ml oil; at that point, take a view and, if you can, add a little more oil. Add lemon juice, tasting as you go, adjust the seasoning and refrigerate.</p> \n<p>Strain the stock into a pan, then bring to a boil and add the shallots. Cook for 10 minutes, then add the rest of the vegetables except the turnip tops. Cook for eight minutes, then reduce the broth to a gentle simmer. Lift the rabbit legs from their fat and use your fingers to scrape off any excess. Add the legs to the pot and let them gently heat through and soften. When they are hot and the vegetables are cooked, stir in the turnip greens and wait for them to wilt.

Food styling: Cara Hobday</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the kind of dish I’d make for a family lunch in Italy, particularly if we were in Sicily, where the red mullet is so good. I’d serve it with a bottle of <a href=\"http://www.planeta.it/en/schede_vino/cometa-doc-sicilia-fiano/\">Cometa</a>, from the Planeta winery, which would assist in my rejuvenating siesta afterwards. The dish is a little involved, true, but it’s worth the effort: the end result is as impressive to look at as it is to eat. If you buy whole fish and ask the fishmonger to fillet them for you, you should keep the bones for the stock (this will give the dish a more intense flavour) and the liver (to beat in right at the end, to enrich the dish); if you can get only fillets, just omit those two extra steps in the method – it’ll still be very tasty. As for the pasta, I’d use garganelli, which can be hard to come by in the UK; casarecce make a good substitute. Any self-respecting Italian would serve this as a separate pasta course, after some antipasti and before a simple whole fish; but hell, it’s summer, so there’s no harm in serving it as a main, perhaps with a green bean, roasted red onion and parmesan salad. Serves four, or six as a starter.</p> \n<p><strong>20g unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />4 small or 2 large red mullet fillets (if possible, ask your fishmonger for the head, bones and liver)<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />400g garganelli or casarecce<br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br />&frac12; glass white wine<br />4 tomatoes, blanched, skinned, deseeded and cut into eighths<br />3 tbsp good black olives, such as taggiasche, pitted<br />4 tbsp passata<br />1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, picked and finely chopped (use the stalks in the stock)</strong></p> \n<p>For the stock<br /><strong>1 tbsp olive oil<br />&frac12; carrot, peeled and cut into chunks<br />&frac12; onion, peeled and cut into chunks<br />1 celery stalk, cut into chunks<br />1 bay leaf<br />2 black peppercorns<br />Mullet heads and bones<br />&frac12; glass white wine <br />&frac12; tbsp tomato paste</strong></p> \n<p>First make the stock. Heat the oil in a pan, add the vegetables, bay leaf, peppercorns and parsley stalks, and sweat for a couple of minutes to soften, but not colour. Add the fish heads and bones and sweat until they start to stick to the base of the pan. Add the wine, leave to bubble until the alcohol has evaporated, then stir in the tomato paste and cook on a low heat for two minutes, taking care that the paste doesn’t burn. Add a little water – enough almost to cover, but not quite – bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Pass through a fine sieve.</p> \n<p>If you’ve got the mullet liver, mash it, preferably with a pestle and mortar, though the back of a knife will do, then put in a bowl with the butter and mix until a uniform pink.</p> \n<p>Cut the fish fillets into strips and bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, ready for the pasta.</p> \n<p>Heat half the oil in a large saute pan. The idea is to cook the garlic (so that it is digestible) but not burn it (or it will be bitter), so here’s a cheffy trick: tilt the pan, making the oil flow to one side, and sweat the garlic gently in that for a few minutes, until it starts to colour – it’s far less likely to burn this way. Meanwhile, put the pasta on to cook.</p> \n<p>Add the mullet to the garlic pan (you can stop tilting now) and cook for a minute or two, until it starts to stick to the pan. Scrape it away and it will flake and crumble. Add the wine and about half a ladle of stock (save the rest for another day), leave it to bubble and reduce for a minute, then stir in the fresh tomato and olives. Mix in the passata and cook gently for two to three minutes more.</p> \n<p>Drain the pasta when it’s been boiling for a minute less than the time stated on the packet (ie, after five or six minutes): it needs to be drained well, almost dry, or it won’t take up the liver butter. Reserve some of the cooking water – in Italy, this is what we use to bring pasta sauces together. Add the pasta to the mullet pan, toss in the rest of the olive oil and, just before serving, beat in the liver butter with a wooden spoon; if need be, loosen with a little reserved cooking water. Scatter the chopped parsley on top, and serve.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Giorgio Locatelli is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.locandalocatelli.com\">Locanda Locatelli</a> in London.</p> \n<p><strong>Fiona Beckett’s wine match </strong>If you want to follow Giorgio’s advice and drink Planeta’s lush <strong>Cometa</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.carluccios.com/shop-online/italian-wine-spirits/cometa-planeta\">you can buy it from Carluccio’s for &pound;19.50 </a>(go to <a href=\"http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/planeta+cometa/1/uk\">wine-searcher.com</a> for other stockists).

Closer to home, David Gerran, bar manager of <a href=\"http://thewhipmayfair.co.uk\">The Whip in Mayfair</a>, has mixed this twist on the julep for me on many occasions, and I’ve coaxed the recipe from his chilled, minty fingers. The key to a great julep is in the careful handling of the mint. These drinks were originally served in pewter tins, but if you don’t have one, a tin camping mug works just fine (or, provided it’s got no sharp edges, the empty tin your apricots were in). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>1 tin apricots – you’ll need 25ml tinned juice for each serving<br />8 mint leaves, plus 1 extra to serve<br />50ml bourbon</strong></p> \n<p>Drain the apricots, saving the juice in a jug (eat the fruit separately – I like them with thick cream or ice-cream, which reminds me a bit of school dinners). Put the mint leaves in the empty tin, then squish into the sides and base of the tin with the back of a spoon: you want to impart a minty flavour over as much of the walls of the tin as you can. Pour in the bourbon, then fill the tin with crushed ice. Pour 25ml tinned apricot juice over the ice, and garnish with fresh mint. Sip slowly.</p> \n<h2><strong>Common or garden G&amp;T</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8fbf80f8a4c173c563efdd1d6ef50bf7aaad820\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673613123/33654967-82e7-44b5-899c-45c3a92b4358-193x420.jpeg\" alt=\"G&amp;T\" width=\"193\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Best drunk propped up on one elbow while lying on a lawn. The bay and sage should be easy to find or “forage” from a park or neighbour’s garden. Gnome optional. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>35ml gin (<a href=\"http://www.sipsmith.com\">Sipsmith’s</a>, for preference)<br />Tonic water (<a href=\"http://www.fever-tree.com\">Fever-Tree</a>, for preference)<br />1 fresh bay leaf<br />1 sage leaf<br />1 lemon wedge</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a large wine glass with ice cubes. Add the gin, top with tonic to taste, and add the bay and sage. Squeeze over the lemon wedge, then drop it into the glass, stir and sip.</p> \n<h2><strong>Vodka martinez</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"90725c112439f0ca68c1d3ffc265175596eae2c8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673023091/2722c33e-5c86-455c-a492-78cea9012b46-205x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Vodka Martinez\" width=\"205\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>The martinez is the father of the martini. Brian Silva of <a href=\"http://balthazarlondon.com\">Balthazar in Covent Garden</a> has mixed one for me more times than I care to remember (or should that be am able to remember?). He uses vodka instead of the gin, and I haven’t looked back since my first sip. The vodka isn’t as domineering, so the aromatics in the vermouth are free to play. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml sweet vermouth<br />15ml vodka <br />4 drops maraschino<br />1 lemon twist</strong></p> \n<p>Chill a sherry glass or coupe. Put the vermouth, vodka and maraschino in a shaker, add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into the glass, squeeze the lemon twist over the drink and discard the lemon. Sip away.</p> \n<h2><strong>Somerset appletini</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05392f5fcb1bbf4182443a39879715f73298c7de\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673077346/8c0a63b6-d06f-4c50-a3a0-99a4c51b9b08-333x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Somerset appletini\" width=\"333\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A Somerset take on the martini, though it actually has very little incommon with that sweet cocktail. The apple part is purely a reference to the eau du vie made by <a href=\"http://www.ciderbrandy.co.uk\">Cider Brandy God Julian Temperley</a>. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>35ml Somerset apple eau du vie<br />15ml Noilly Pratt<br />1 lemon twist</strong></p> \n<p>Chill a coupe glass. Combine the eau du vie and vermouth in a shaker, stir until chilled, then double strain into the glass. Squeeze the lemon twist over the drink and drop into the glass.</p> \n<h2><strong>Michelada</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aea3449666079ae212cf87e0770e68cceea9eaf8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673125275/0443b2fa-87e0-4a2f-9348-4ed0d2e7c000-319x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Michelada\" width=\"319\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>West Country meets Mexico in this gorgeous summer drink. Trust me on this one: the combination of tomato, spice, salt, acidity and beer is brilliant. Also great served as a small shot alongside a healthy measure of good tequila (in Mexico, this is known as sangrita). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml tomato juice<br />25ml apple juice<br />Juice of &frac12; lime <br />1 tsp chipotle paste<br />1 dash <a href=\"http://www.cholula.com\">Cholula sauce</a><br />1 lime wedge <br />Sea salt, for the rim<br />Chapel Down’s <a href=\"http://www.chapeldown.com/curious-brew\">Curious Brew lager</a> (or any other good British lager)</strong></p> \n<p>Mix all of the ingredients except the beer. Roll the rim of a highball or half-pint glass in coarse sea salt and fill with ice. Pour in the mix, add the lime wedge and top with beer. Make more immediately.</p> \n<h2><strong>White Russian</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"705627e82a039d28bf4ae49919f2b9b0d2d22d6f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673199191/ed7bfad6-d294-4c16-9fcc-3723abd7420e-240x420.jpeg\" alt=\"White Russian\" width=\"240\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This simple cocktail gives the drinker a white moustache. Made famous by <a href=\"http://\">the Dude in The Big Lebowski</a>, white Russian has a creamy texture, obviously, and a sweet, boozy finish. I like to use <a href=\"http://www.blackcow.co.uk\">Black Cow vodka</a> here: it’s distilled from milk, so seems very fitting, plus it’s made in Dorset. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml Black Cow vodka<br />25ml Kahlua <br />25ml cream<br />Swizzle stick, to serve</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a tumbler with cubed ice. Add the vodka and Kahlua, and stir. Carefully pour on the cream – you want it to stay on top in a distinct layer – and serve with a swizzle stick.</p> \n<h2><strong>Strawberry, lemonade and mint</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"75c1b8e25d410e682e6ba8fd1c794ec8f85d9de7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673246934/c4694a0f-49ab-4a7b-b6fa-d25369b89498-202x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Strawberry cocktail\" width=\"202\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A thirst-quenching number with an almost sherbety finish for any alcohol-abstainers at your gathering (and also rather splendid dosed with a shot of vodka or gin). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>3 strawberries<br />125ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans Victorian lemonade</a> (or other cloudy lemonade)<br />1 small handful fresh mint<br />1 sprig fresh mint and 1 strawberry, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Put three strawberries in the base of a highball glass and muddle (ie, bash) until smooth. Add the handful of mint, gently muddle again, then top with lemonade and stir to mix. Top with ice and garnish with a sprig of mint and a whole strawberry.</p> \n<h2><strong>Honey sazerac</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"db6c3db5228d69d622a36e7cd6aa43edf2650ff8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673310086/deaae14e-aba0-4ae3-9f1c-567af9b10474-257x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Honey\" width=\"257\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A strong drop that makes a superb closer to an evening. I’ve used honey rather than the more usual sugar, because I find that gives a smoother finish; the dash of absinthe leaves a heady, aniseed coating on the glass. If you’re making a batch, serve from a jug with lots of ice, and sip from a set of chilled small cups or shot glasses. Sometimes drinking from tiny vessels gives a very different perspective on life. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>1 dash absinthe<br />50ml rye whisky<br />1 tsp honey<br />3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters<br />1 dash Angostura bitters <br />Lemon twist, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Swirl the absinthe and a little ice around your chosen drinking vessels. Put the whisky, honey and both bitters in a shaker, and stir to dissolve the honey. Add ice and stir again for 30 seconds. Tip out the ice and absinthe from the glasses (or drink it: no one’s watching) and fill with fresh ice. Strain the shaker into two glasses, squeeze a lemon twist over each drink and drop in.</p> \n<h2><strong>Storm in a teacup</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"589f2c30e7635eeeec63ec2b7672eb0e4a47c3ca\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673359286/6a9faf01-04fd-4332-a896-556fb6512bfa-291x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Storm in teacup\" width=\"291\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This is essentially a dark’n’stormy served in a teacup: a perfect way to disguise daytime drinking. If anyone asks, it’s darjeeling. The rosemary adds a savoury, herbal note. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>100ml <a href=\"http://www.goslingsrum.com\">Gosling’s rum</a> <br />25ml lime juice<br />250ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans ginger beer</a><br />2 slices fresh lime<br />2 rosemary sprigs</strong></p> \n<p>Combine the rum, lime juice and ginger beer in a teapot with plenty of ice, and stir. Pour into teacups (saucers obligatory), and garnish with a slice of lime and a rosemary sprig.</p> \n<h2><strong>Marmalade punch</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bb11d732fcba6581bfd63e6514c1055bb4a3e8ba\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673403359/4ff25856-5ffd-4a88-b206-c4b5bfd67ff1-348x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Marmalade\" width=\"348\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Just the ticket for a summer party: it has a gentle heat, and the whisky, orange and ginger are all fitting companions. The overarching flavour is one of marmalade. If Paddington Bear were old enough to drink, and also not a bear, this would be his drink of choice. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>500ml cloudy apple juice<br />250ml Fentimans ginger beer <br />100ml whisky<br />2 dashes Angostura orange bitters<br />Juice of &frac12; lemon <br />8 slices orange</strong></p> \n<p>Put everything bar four slices of orange into a large jar or jug with lots of ice. Stir, pour into tankards, peg an orange slice to the side of each and swig. Dead posh, this.</p> \n<h2><strong>White sangria</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"86777cef50044ecf7b58438b0e38217cde1e36dd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673489268/5a77e0ab-c253-4730-afef-d510dc8b04de-285x420.jpeg\" alt=\"white sangria\" width=\"285\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A gorgeous, fruity number in which the basil draws the drink towards a more aromatic and savoury conclusion. Thoroughly grown-up. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>6 strawberries<br />30g sugar<br />1 750ml bottle sauvignon blanc<br />Juice from 1 lemon<br />1 small apple, sliced<br />1 small handful fresh basil leaves</strong></p> \n<p>An hour ahead, cut the strawberries in half and sprinkle with sugar: the sugar will draw out flavour and form a syrup. Combine everything in a large jug, making sure to scrape in all the sugary strawberry juice, top with ice and stir. Serve in chilled tumblers or rocks glasses.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackabevan\">Jack Adair Bevan</a> is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.theethicurean.com\">The Ethicurean in Bristol</a>.

aren’t about spending hours at a hot stove; they should be planned to give you the space to catch up with friends and family, gossip and kick back. Much of the work involved in this summery menu can be done in advance. All you have to do when your guests turn up is chuck a couple of ingredients on the barbecue and toss together a salad. That leaves you plenty of time to enjoy being outside as much as possible. Have fun.</p> \n<h2><strong>Grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7431b8da468f23e6cbdd701b01b8b697042df51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435682683820/a9176f92-f820-4d11-bbbe-7c605c8a9775-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds: ‘A perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Halloumi is a wonder ingredient, and at its best when introduced to some heat, ideally flame. Here, slices of halloumi are whipped straight from the barbecue to the platter (it doesn’t do sitting around very well), then tossed with juicy peaches, wafer-thin ribbons of courgette and almonds fried in butter. It’s a perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors. Serves six to eight.</p> \n<p><strong>6 small courgettes<br />4 peaches, peeled, stoned and cut into thickish wedges<br />1 big handful mint leaves, roughly chopped<br />Juice of 1 large lemon<br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />20g butter<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />50g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped<br />&frac14; tsp paprika <br />500g halloumi, cut into 1cm-thick slices</strong></p> \n<p>Light the barbecue an hour before you want to eat (failing that, use a griddle pan). Peel the courgettes into long, thin strips with a vegetable peeler, rotating them as you do so and stopping before you get to the seedy centre (keep the middles for stewing in olive oil for a soup or side dish the next day). Put the ribbons in a salad bowl with the peach wedges, mint, lemon juice and three tablespoons of oil, toss gently but thoroughly and set aside.</p> \n<p>Put a small frying pan on a medium heat, add the butter and season generously. Swirling the pan constantly, melt the butter and cook for two to three minutes, until it starts darkening. Add the chopped almonds and paprika, cook for another minute or two, until the butter is a dark, biscuity colour and the almonds are golden, then scatter over the salad.</p> \n<p>Rub the slices of halloumi in the remaining tablespoon of oil, then lay on the hottest part of the barbecue (or on a heated griddle pan). Grill for 30-60 seconds on each side, until char marks appear and the cheese softens. Cut each halloumi slice in half, toss into the salad and taste: you may want a scrunch of black pepper, a sprinkling of sea salt, a squeeze more lemon or a touch more olive oil. Adjust accordingly and serve at once.</p> \n<p><strong>Barbecued rabbit (or chicken) with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f5933327bd4f4f84001da3641c975c1790570dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683145236/ea3b7813-2416-484d-a2aa-b7db15f5dcfc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli: ‘Sensational.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve used free-range farmed rabbit here, which is really tender and tasty, but skin-on chicken thighs or even a whole spatchcocked chicken will work just as well. The combination of the black, herby rub, sweet tomatoes and garlicky mayonnaise is sensational. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>3 bunches fresh thyme, 1 bunch picked and finely chopped<br />1 bunch fresh mint<br />5 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped <br />Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 farmed rabbits, jointed into 8 pieces (or chicken thighs)<br />80ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 punnets cherry tomatoes, halved<br />A few splashes red-wine vinegar </strong></p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli<br /><strong>2 egg yolks<br />1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed to a paste with a little salt<br />1 tsp Dijon mustard<br />750ml mild olive oil <br />Juice of &frac12; lemon</strong></p> \n<p>Put the barbecue on about an hour before you want to eat. Put two dry frying pans on a medium-high heat and divide between them two of the bunches of thyme and the mint. Dry-toast the herbs, shaking the pan every so often, until they have blackened and the room is smelling fragrant – about 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Put two-thirds of the garlic, the chopped thyme and a big pinch of salt in a mortar and bash with a pestle until you have a green paste (or use a food mixer). Pull the leaves from the burnt herbs, add these to the mortar and bash again until broken down and thoroughly mixed in. You should now have a blackish rub. Season generously, transfer to a large bowl and mix in the lemon zest. Add the rabbit pieces and rub them all over with the marinade.</p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli, put the egg yolks, garlic, mustard and a generous pinch of salt into a food processor and blitz briefly. With the motor running, very slowly drip the oil through the funnel of the processor, until the mayonnaise starts to thicken and emulsify, then pour in the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream. Loosen with lemon juice and a few tablespoons of water, season to taste and transfer to a bowl.</p> \n<p>Put the oil and the rest of the garlic in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Once the garlic begins to bubble in the oil, cook for a minute or two to soften, then stir in the tomatoes and season generously. Cover with a lid, turn the heat right down and poach gently for 10 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened. Season with the vinegar to taste, and set aside.</p> \n<p>Once the barbecue is ready (ie, when you can hold your hand over the coals for only about five seconds before it gets too hot for comfort), put the rabbit legs and shoulders on the grill. After five minutes, add the belly pieces and, five minutes later, the ribs and saddle. Turn the pieces frequently until charred all over, brushing them with any leftover marinade as they cook – it should take 15-20 minutes from start to finish. (To check that the meat is done, cut into a thick piece.) Pile the cooked rabbit on to a large plate, squeeze over some lemon juice, then spoon on the juicy tomatoes, followed by the a&iuml;oli. Serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26d235d0cb1ebf1d305499af9aa58c0efbe7239d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435744594796/393c318f-2ca4-4d4d-9391-486a1afcee3f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: 'Low in gluten.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: ‘Low in gluten.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This delicious cocoa-rye pastry comes from <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tartine-2.html\">Chad Robertson’s amazing book Tartine 3</a> (&pound;24.99, Chronicle Books). It gives the sweet cardamom custard a crisp, grown-up, dark chocolate edge. It’s also very low in gluten. Serve with a bowl of fresh raspberries alongside. You’ll need a 26cm tart tin. Serves 12-16.</p> \n<p>For the cocoa-rye pastry<strong><br />500g unsalted butter<br />200g caster sugar<br />1 large egg plus 1 yolk, at room temperature<br />&frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />280g rye flour, sifted<br />170g cocoa powder, sifted, plus extra for dusting</strong></p> \n<p>For the cardamom custard<strong><br />350ml whole milk<br />350ml double cream<br />6 cardamom pods, seeds crushed<br />Seeds from 1 vanilla pod<br />10 egg yolks<br />120g caster sugar</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. To make the pastry, beat the butter and sugar with a paddle mixer until soft and a pale cream colour – this will take a few minutes. Beat in the whole egg, then the yolk, and stop the mixer. Scrape down the sides and beat in the vanilla, followed by the flour and cocoa, until thoroughly combined. Transfer the pastry to a large piece of clingfilm, pat into a rectangle and refrigerate for at least an hour, until firm.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the custard. Put the milk, cream, cardamom, vanilla seeds and pod into a saucepan and bring to simmering point. Simmer gently for three minutes, then set aside for 10 minutes to infuse. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, until light and pale. Discard the vanilla pod, then whisk the warm milk into the eggs and pour into a jug.</p> \n<p>Divide the dough in two and freeze half for another day. Dust both sides of the remaining dough lightly with cocoa powder and roll out between two large pieces of baking paper or clingflim, rotating as you do, until it’s an even thickness of about 4mm. Carefully roll the pastry on to the rolling pin and transfer to a 26cm tart tin. Press firmly into all the corners of the tin, leaving an overhang of roughly 0.5cm. Trim off any excess dough.</p> \n<p>Freeze the pastry case for 15 minutes, then line with baking paper, fill with baking beans and blind bake for 20 minutes, until slightly puffed up. Remove the paper and beans, and bake for 10-15 minutes longer, until the case is completely cooked (take care not to burn it, so check after 10 minutes).</p> \n<p>Turn down the oven to 140C/285F/gas mark 1. Run a sharp knife along the edges of the tart shell to neaten it, then pour in the custard, filling it up right to the brim. Bake in the centre of the oven for about 50 minutes, until just set – it shouldn’t wobble in the centre when you gently shake the tin. Leave the tart to cool completely, and serve with fresh raspberries.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of

For instance, did you know that the Bee Gees have sold more than 200m records? That nearly 10 million people watched <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jan/02/tv-ratings-mrs-browns-boys-dethrones-queen\">the Mrs Brown’s Boys Christmas special</a>? Or that <a href=\"https://www.npdgroup.co.uk/wps/portal/npd/uk/news/press-releases/pubs-continue-to-build-on-food-success/\">less than one-in-10 visits to the pub</a> are now solely for the purpose of having a drink?</p> \n<p>“Sorry, come again?” you may ask of that last factoid, and you would be right to question it. Despite <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Trends-Reports/Dining-trends-Fewer-than-one-in-10-pub-visits-now-solely-drink-occasions\">the headlines that greeted this latest research</a> from market analysts NPD, its central thrust – that British pubs are now primarily places to eat rather than drink – is not quite<em> </em>as dramatic as it first appears. NPD reported that 92 out of every 100 pub visits now involve the consumption of food. But when I asked NPD to clarify this, it transpires that it counts crisps and nuts. “If the panellist considers a pint and crisps as their dinner, they can declare them as such,” said a spokesperson.</p> \n<p>That is a less resounding death knell for the quick pint than was <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/358129/pub-food-on-the-up-as-operators-diversify\">reported at the time</a>, but it does not soften NPD’s wider message. For those who bemoan the march of the gastropub and the way that many pubs now marginalise drinkers, this report makes grim reading. There are now 100m breakfasts sold in pubs annually, up 128% since 2008. The number of servings of alcohol in pubs has dropped by more than a quarter over the same period, while consumption of tea and coffee has risen by more than 11%. It appears to confirm what analysts and the huge pub companies have been saying for years: that the pint and the traditional boozer is in decline and, to survive, your local must become a family-friendly, food-led pub.</p> \n<p>You can see that happening all around you. Twenty-nine pubs shut each week, and those that survive are, increasingly, places to dine not drink. They are effectively restaurants in former pub spaces. I have nothing against that per se. However, no one could argue that the character of a pub is not hugely altered (that something special is lost, even), in that shift of focus from booze to food. Moreover, while this broad generational change is irrefutable, the propaganda around food-led pubs as the only viable business model has shut out discussion of potential alternatives. There are, although you might not know it, purist drinking dens bucking this rush to food.</p> \n<p>The last few years has seen a surge in pubs where you might get a bowl of wasabi peas (the most illogical pub snack ever) or, at most, a cheese barm, but whose offer is very much based around fantastic drinks, not food. The craft beer movement has been a game-changer in that respect, with – to name but a few – Manchester’s Port Street Beer House, Cask Tavern and Smithfield Tavern; Conwy’s Albion; the Black Dove in Brighton; the Wellington and Craven Arms in Birmingham; or the York, Euston and Harrogate Taps all thriving while doing at most the bare minimum of food. </p> \n<p>In some ways, the fast-growing <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/09/community-fixers-mighty-rise-micropub\">micropub movement</a> (small, no-frills pubs) is an implicit kick-back against the rise of shiny, barnlike family food pubs. In Manchester, there has been a remarkable recent growth in suburban bars that exclusively specialise in great beer. Many of these – Heaton Hops in Stockport, <a href=\"http://prairie-schooner-taphouse.co.uk/\">the Prairie Schooner in Urmston</a>, BarBeerian in Whitefield – double-up as bottle shops, too, a formula replicated at, for instance, Cardiff’s Gravity Station or Tall Boys in Leeds. The message? Stock high-quality, unusual drinks and that, in itself, can turn a pub into a destination. </p> \n<p>That specialism and sense of occasion is something cocktail bars have exploited for years, without feeling the need to serve food. At the same time, a new wave of informal London wine bars, such as Vindinista and <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/bars-pubs/sager-wilde\">Sager + Wilde</a>, while serving food, don’t trouble themselves much beyond short menus comprising small plates, sandwiches, cheeses and charcuterie. Fundamentally, these are places to drink exciting wine. The food is almost incidental.</p> \n<p>I love restaurants, but they have a completely different dynamic to pubs and bars. Pubs are democratic, communal, potentially raucous adult spaces in a way that restaurants (almost) never are. And that is something precious.
