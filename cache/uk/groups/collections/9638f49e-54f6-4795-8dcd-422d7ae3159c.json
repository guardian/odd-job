David Williams sifts through the shelves to find the best on offer at Bargain Booze</p>","byline":"David Williams","body":"<p><strong>Ravenswood Old Vine Zinfandel, Lodi, California 2012 (&pound;9.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bargainbooze.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bargain Booze</strong></a><strong>) </strong>From the name on the door to the stuff on the shelves, the frills at Bargain Booze are kept to an absolute minimum. “Lidl Shmidl” says the publicity material, reminding customers that the chain is all about mass-market brands at prices that match the German discounter’s range of never-before-seen lagers and gins. It’s not the sort of place you’d go looking for a natural wine from a tiny producer, just as you wouldn’t go to a chain of butcher’s calling itself Cheap Chicken to pick up an organic free-range bird. But if you have a brand you’re fond of, it’s worth at least checking in at one of BB’s 618 stores – the price of Ravenswood’s consistently sumptuous red, for example, stacks up very well against retailing rivals great and small.</p> \n<p><strong>Otra Vida Malbec, Mendoza, Argentina 2014 (&pound;4.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bargainbooze.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bargain Booze</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Having tasted a small sample of wines on offer at a recent tasting put on by Bargain Booze’s owners, Conviviality Retail, and then nosed around the BB website, I’ve found you have to do a fair bit of digging through some very ordinary stuff to get to the odd gem. The BB range leans heavily on the noxiously sweet and industrial, inexplicably bestselling stuff like Yellowtail, Barefoot and Apothic, or lesser-known names such as the aptly named Crimes Red, Australia 2014 (&pound;7.99), the jarring jammy sweetness of which left my palate feeling violated. The hunt is worthwhile, though: the fragrant, juicy raspberry and cherry of Otra Vida Malbec, from the Argentine operation of Chilean producer Concha y Toro, is, at less than a fiver, a superb barbecue bottle.</p> \n<p><strong>Kosi Bay Sauvignon Blanc, Western Cape, South Africa 2014 (&pound;5.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bargainbooze.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bargain Booze</strong></a><strong>) </strong>A quid more than the Malbec, but equally good value, is this terrific Cape Sauvignon, which has all the leafy verve, passion fruit and lime I look for in this grape variety in a dry, racy style: highly recommended if you’re having a party over the summer. Even better in terms of quality is the wonderfully relaxed mature Baron de Ley Rioja Gran Reserva 2008. At &pound;19.99, I wouldn’t rush out to buy it, however. Especially when the decidedly more upmarket London merchant Roberson is offering the silkily smooth and savoury joys of Bodegas Las Orcas Decenio Rioja Reserva 2002 at just &pound;12.95. Now that really is some bargain booze.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352108660/wines-of-the-week-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for.","credit":"/PR","altText":"wines of the week","cleanCaption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T05:00:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T05:00:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":5,"contributors":[{"name":"David Williams","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/david-williams"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Wine","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"David Williams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/david-williams"}}],"series":{"title":"David Williams's wines of the week","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/david-williams-wines-of-the-week"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/good-wine-at-rock-bottom-prices-david-williams","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4af8q","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/good-wine-at-rock-bottom-prices-david-williams","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/good-wine-at-rock-bottom-prices-david-williams"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352108660/wines-of-the-week-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for.","credit":"/PR","altText":"wines of the week","cleanCaption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for."}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Review"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352108660/wines-of-the-week-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for.","credit":"/PR","altText":"wines of the week","cleanCaption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for."}}]},{"title":"A pub date with Lance, who describes himself as short, fat and bald","rawTitle":"A pub date with Lance, who describes himself as short, fat and bald","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/11/pub-date-short-plain-bald-man","title":"A pub date with Lance, who describes himself as short, fat and bald","trailText":"He’d bought a bottle of wine and was dressed as if about to go down a ravine with Bear Grylls","standFirst":"He’d bought a bottle of wine and was dressed as if about to go down a ravine with Bear Grylls","byline":"Stella Grey","body":"<p>Miles’s smiling face popped up on another dating site this week, one he’d freshly joined, and so I sent him a message via their system, just saying hello. He’d said he wanted to be friends. He didn’t, though.</p> \n<p>Back came the reply: “I’m sorry again that I disappeared on you. I felt overwhelmed. To be honest, all that stuff about wanting to be stitched into someone else’s life was kind of claustrophobic.”</p> \n<p>It wasn’t that, Miles. It was my body – tell the truth, I said aloud to the screen, but didn’t write. So it wasn’t really my not conforming to his type. It was my neediness that damned me.</p> \n<p>I asked what was wrong with wanting to be stitched into someone else’s life, if the stitching was mutual and contented. He said that living alone had taught him that he needs to be fundamentally independent. Shared meals, evenings, nights, should be a matter of choice: surely that was a truly liberated way of life? When I argued with this, he interpreted my scepticism as a proposition.</p> \n<p>“I can’t offer what you want,” he wrote. “And nice though it is to hear from you, I can’t offer you a date either.”</p> \n<p>I wasn’t looking for a date. “I’m not looking for a date, but thanks. Just saw your face pop up here and thought I’d say hello. All the best. Good luck.”</p> \n<p>When I logged into another website that I’m registered on, there was a message from him. He’d joined the day before, found me and written to say he thought we should have that lunch at his house and see what happens. But that was before we’d had the conversation we’d just had. “I don’t imagine this invitation still stands,” I replied. He did not answer.</p> \n<p>Then, there was an email from Lee, the Austrian, saying that he regretted we hadn’t met, in the end, and that we should have had the conversation about femininity face to face as it might have turned out differently. We would have smiled while we argued. We would have enjoyed the debate. Good relationships need friction, after all, he said. How about a drink? OK, I said. A drink. Why not. When, where? He didn’t reply. I wrote again. “Just name the day. Name the date.” Then I laughed a lot at my own joke.</p> \n<p>The culmination of this series of blasts from the past was a dating site message from Peter. It was as if I’d conjured him up by thinking about him, my long-distance disappointment of February. Peter has my email address and mobile number, but opted for the formality of the site email system.</p> \n<p>“Hello again. How’s it going for you?” he asked blandly. I told him it was going fine. He launched in to an account of his life since he’d kissed my head and got on a train and dumped me. He’d had a few short-term&nbsp;relationships. He’d thought he’d found “the one”, and then it turned out she wasn’t. They’d got on each other’s nerves. He’d realised that he needed to stop chasing the pretty girls and think about the intellectual fit. “And so – why are you contacting me again, Peter?” I asked him. “Have I been held in reserve until the wind changed?” There was no answer to&nbsp;that.</p> \n<p>I put on some lipstick and a red frock and went to the pub to meet Lance. Lance is short and plain and bald; he’d written a funny message admitting to these failings and listing his good points. (One was that he couldn’t make up his mind about Marmite, and thus was an original thinker, which made me smile.)</p> \n<p>At the pub, Lance was already ensconced in a corner and had bought a bottle of wine. We drank it. He was dressed as if he was about to go down into a ravine with Bear Grylls. We didn’t have much to talk about. Eventually he looked at his watch for the fourth time and said he had an early start, and should go home.</p> \n<p>Outside, he kissed me on the cheek, and said, “Look, I’m not sure, I have to be honest.”</p> \n<p>I said that was fine, and off we went in our different directions. That’s what most internet dates are like. That’s what most of mine are like. They are just not very interesting to read about.</p> \n<p><em>Stella Grey is a pseudonym</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/greystellagrey\" title=\"\">@GreyStellaGrey</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436180452360/Jar-of-marmite-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lance argued that as he couldn't make up his mind about Marmite, he was an original thinker.

I’ve been to Marseillan, and I love Noilly Prat, but I didn’t visit the premises because my wife was suffering from galloping morning sickness when we were there. One day I’d love to see where the magic happens – not least for the art nouveau spiral staircase designed by someone called Gustave Eiffel. I wonder what happened to him ...</p> \n<p>Instead, we stayed my aunt’s house in nearby Pom&eacute;rols. It wasn’t a bad way to spend a holiday – for me at least. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/19/vermouth-revival-masterclass-fortified-wine\">Vermouth revival: a masterclass in fortified wine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>All around us were hectares of piquepoul vines (it’s wonderfully French that the grape is spelt differently to the wine). These grapes were originally planted to go into Noilly Prat, but declining vermouth sales meant that local farmers had to find a different outlet for them. Happily, they make an extremely good, piquant white wine. The word “piquepoul” means something like “lip sting” in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language\">Occitan</a>. </p> \n<p>The process of turning the piquepoul grapes into Noilly Prat is a complex one. Wine made from Clairette grapes is used as well – both are fortified and then left outside in barrels to bake and oxidise in the sun, where they take on that distinctive nutty, sherried taste. This unusual ageing process is shared with the fortified wines of Rivesaltes, Maury and Banyuls a bit further up the coast. The aged wines are then blended and steeped with herbs, spices and fruit peel and sweetened with a special flavoured mixture of alcohol and grape juice. <br /></p> \n<p>There’s a British link, too. The firm was founded in 1855 by Louis Noilly and his son-in-law Claudius Prat, who was from England. Therefore the T in Prat is pronounced. Noilly should be pronounced in the French way, though I just say “Noi Lee”, and nobody seems to mind. The ordinary dry Noilly Prat is superb in a martini, and great to cook with instead of sherry. They also make a rarer, red vermouth: it’s sweeter and more orangey, and it makes a good long drink with tonic and lemon. There’s also an ambre version, but I’ve never met anyone who has seen, let alone tried it.</p> \n<p>After a few days in Pom&eacute;rols, my wife and I were taken on a tour of the vineyards up in the hills around Faug&egrave;res by a couple who ran a tailored holiday business. Despite telling them about my wife’s fragile state, they insisted on taking us on long scenic routes involving hairpin bends. There was much vomiting. When we finally got to the B&amp;B, they had provided a meal consisting largely of raw meats, shellfish and unpasteurised cheeses. A trip to Noilly Prat would have been a picnic in comparison.<br /><em><br /></em></p> \n<ul> \n <li><em><em>Henry Jeffreys’ first book, Empire of Booze, will be published by Unbound in 2016. @henrygjeffreys</em><br /></em></li> \n</ul>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/56196c87d095141c94283c690bf8c73a11fbcb89/0_339_5120_3070/5120.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3070,"width":5120,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Owen Franken/Corbis","altText":"Harvester picking grapes in Pomérols, France","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Owen Franken/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T11:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T23:01:48Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Henry Jeffreys","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/henry-jeffreys"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Wine","Alcohol","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"},{"id":"society/alcohol","webTitle":"Alcohol"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Henry Jeffreys","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/henry-jeffreys"}}],"series":{"title":"Empire of drinks","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/empire-of-drinks"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/noilly-prat-vermouth-fortified-wine-factory-marseillan","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agbz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/noilly-prat-vermouth-fortified-wine-factory-marseillan","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/noilly-prat-vermouth-fortified-wine-factory-marseillan"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/56196c87d095141c94283c690bf8c73a11fbcb89/0_339_5120_3070/5120.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3070,"width":5120,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The process from harvesting the grapes to making Noilly Prat is a long and complex one … and destined to remain mysterious to Henry.

It has a really pretty, floral edge and is, dare I say it, even more appealing than Provence ros&eacute;.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><a href=\"http://www.matchingfoodandwine.com\">matchingfoodandwine.com</a></li> \n</ul>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435758609371/baadf788-efe2-471f-a849-aa194500b7ec-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PETER HUGGINS / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"Wine: rose","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PETER HUGGINS / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435758775730/4844b7e8-cb6b-4b53-b8dc-e5307c3111d9-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":354,"width":99,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Great with salade niçoise.","credit":"PR","altText":"Wine: Whispering Angel","cleanCaption":"Great with salade niçoise."}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T17:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T23:01:10Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":43,"contributors":[{"name":"Fiona Beckett","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/1/1422809894605/Fiona-Beckett-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/fionabeckett"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Wine","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Fiona Beckett","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/fionabeckett"}}],"series":{"title":"Fiona Beckett on wine","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/fiona-beckett-on-wine"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/09/rose-wine-supermarket-merchant-review","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a6by","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/09/rose-wine-supermarket-merchant-review","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/09/rose-wine-supermarket-merchant-review"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436432094086/f020fe66-1f47-4914-ac4a-bde37f8af00f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Pink rules.

Nobody knew what a frappuccino was. Staff had to put a handwritten sign saying “milky coffee” next to the generic window sign plugging their “delicious latte”.</p> \n<p>The queue was full of fearful locals who just wanted a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/may/27/tea-national-disgrace-beverage-british\">pot of tea</a>. But it was an undoubted thrill for the young folk. Actually, getting some frothy milk in a cup is still more fun than most people up here will have in a lifetime. And the sight of the first gingerbread latte of the year still gets me all hot and bothered.</p> \n<p>To me, coffee shops are quite fun places for all – teens like them because it makes them feel grownup; adults like them for meetings; you can have a harmless date there, and some are even licensed (yay!). What you don’t want is some chin-stroking, smirking joy thief looking at you like you’ve done it wrong at the till. But that’s what’s happening. </p> \n<p>As a nation, we drink about 165m cups of coffee a day. Men (1.7 cups) drink more than women (1.5 cups). More than eight out of 10 of us drink it at home, in the office, or in one of the tens of thousands of coffee shops that litter every town and city, <a href=\"http://reports.mintel.com/sinatra/oxygen/list/id=679744&amp;type=RCItem#0_1___page_RCItem=0\">which equates to an annual national spend of more than &pound;1bn</a>.</p> \n<p>But as the industry grows, so does the aching presence of the <a href=\"http://www.timhayward.com/\">coffee bore.</a> And they’re everywhere. Not for the first time, the “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4759ab4a53dfafead5273aa05fcfba9defee95e8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269152802/487aaa7a-7a1e-48f3-9749-b7fa7ab70c79-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Until last week, I had never seen or heard of <a href=\"http://www.caffeinemag.com/\"><em>Caffeine</em> magazine</a>. But there it was, in an indie Manchester coffee shop that had just nervously taken three attempts to crack my order of black coffee with hot milk. “<em>Is</em> Fika just a fad?” pondered the magazine. I don’t know, but the reason I don’t know is because I don’t know what Fika is. I’ve never seen a more niche magazine – and I’ve worked for the company that publishes Coin-operated Laundry Monthly and Rubber &amp; Plastics Weekly. </p> \n<p>Do I want my beans ground fine or coarse? I don’t know. I don’t care enough about the production method. Yes, sneer if you like. But it’s only coffee, isn’t it? Well, not to the bloke who stood next to me in the latest coffee house to spring up in Manchester’s Northern Quarter recently, who spent a good 15 minutes cross-examining one of the poor baristas about which variety of Guatemalan bean he’d best be suited to. He wanted to see them. And sniff them. A lot. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f855f74ffe3a328a401661ec8535681be425ea90\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269247350/f5012047-64af-4ad3-a41b-17ee9a276fc4-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"The shiny tin of posh coffee.\" width=\"270\" height=\"405\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The shiny tin of posh coffee.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I am but a mere normal. I like quality but I’m not obsessive. I’ll go to Costa or Starbucks just as much as the indies. I don’t have a favourite variety of bean. I accidentally bought ground coffee in the supermarket the other day thinking it was instant, because all I was really looking at was <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=illy+tin&amp;tbm=shop\">the shiny tin it came in</a>. Which wouldn’t be so bad except for the fact that I don’t own a cafetiere.</p> \n<p>I’m not an idiot. I went to university. I know how to change a car tyre. I’ve put two children through school. I just don’t know everything there is to know about coffee. Sorry. Has anybody else started to develop a jangling case of nerves as they approach a barista? Just me? How has this happened?</p> \n<p>When the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/may/08/craft-beer-mild-robinsons-campaign-for-real-ale-camra\">craft ale thing</a> started to happen, it was made slightly less enjoyable by the intensely solemn “punk” taste-makers, who acted as a sort of unofficial booze police. In a nutshell, they were rude, patronising and painfully boring. I just want a nice cup of coffee. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436265180290/d9928d67-5113-4c7e-abc3-f1e9a2c68cc8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Timothy Fadek","altText":"The Barn, a coffee shop in Berlin, which does not serve milk or sugar with coffee.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Timothy Fadek"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269153327/487aaa7a-7a1e-48f3-9749-b7fa7ab70c79-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.’ Photograph: Alamy","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.'","cleanCaption":"‘The “craft” movement is slowly and earnestly sucking the joy out of something that isn’t half as complicated or important as some people think it is.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269247350/f5012047-64af-4ad3-a41b-17ee9a276fc4-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":405,"width":270,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"The shiny tin of posh coffee.
