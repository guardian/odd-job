Even so, there’s no escaping it: those of us who have dads will need to make a gesture of some sort, and if you’re old enough to be buying booze, chances are your dad is at least in his mid-40s, and probably older. And that he’ll appreciate a good bottle of red – or, at least, one that he perceives to be a good bottle. Well, the good news is, you needn’t spend a fortune on it.</p> \n<p>For example, you can get the appealingly supple <strong>Ch&acirc;teau Jouanin C&ocirc;tes de Castillon 2012</strong> (13.5% abv) for &pound;8.49 from selected Co-ops at the moment, which is considerably less than you’d spend on the average Saint-Emilion. Or, better still, a bottle of the ultra-reliable <strong>Baron de Ley Rioja Reserva 2010</strong> (13.5% abv) is also on offer at the Co-op at a very keen &pound;7.99 instead of the usual &pound;10.99. (Both these offers run until the end of the month.)</p> \n<p>Sainsbury’s, meanwhile, has the mature, mellow (hopefully like your dad) <a href=\"http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/gb/groceries/era-costana-crianza-75cl?langId=44&amp;storeId=10151&amp;krypto=S4YgK8gVYHc7A3fN%2FDTWjGkynseb%2Fh1k3wTuzIIbhTFmocEP5O7muRMrMR3wDwkIkL96M9Jmgj2g%0A3HQGSd%2BoGEbbH5%2BqYSRiDSHWP1IV%2Bt70R%2FdKxydmvroKq7FTtICH&amp;ddkey=http:gb/groceries/era-costana-crianza-75cl\"><strong>Era Costana Rioja Crianza 2012</strong></a> (13.5% abv), which is better than you have any right to expect for &pound;7.

But Reg Drury, who has died aged 76, was a brewer of the “old school”.</p> \n<p>He worked for Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner in Chiswick, west London, for 40 years, ending as director of brewing. All who met him found him charming, unassuming, patient and willing to spend time discussing beer, its components, flavours and complexities. Nevertheless, there was quiet passion and determination under the donnish exterior. Reg loved cask-conditioned beer – real ale – and he was determined to both save it and perfect it when he arrived at Fuller’s in 1959.</p> \n<p>The 1960s and 70s were a time of turmoil in the industry. Dozens of old regional breweries disappeared as a series of takeovers and mergers created six national brewing giants. They were determined to supply a new type of beer – keg beer – to the thousands of pubs they owned. The Big Six, as they were called, had little time for finicky cask beer. It was perishable, and a cask had to be finished within a few days once it was broached. Keg beer, on the other hand – chilled, filtered, pasteurised and artificially carbonated – offered the certainties of long shelf-life and bigger profits.</p> \n<p>Reg was aware of the dilemma facing brewers of traditional ale when he joined Fuller’s. He had trained at the acclaimed school of brewing at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. He not only knew how to brew beer of all types, but was skilled also in maintaining the consistency and quality of the end product.</p> \n<p>It was difficult to achieve consistency at Fuller’s at the time. Brewing had been going on at the Thames-side site for 350 years, with the partnership of Fuller, Smith &amp; Turner dating from 1845. Cask beer was produced in open fermenters, some of which were more than 100 years old and leaked. Finding a clear and tasty pint of Fuller’s cask ale in a pub was something of a gamble.</p> \n<p>Backed by vast advertising budgets, keg beers such as Watneys Red Barrel, Double Diamond and Worthington E became market leaders, refashioning the market and threatening the future of ale brewers. The directors of Fuller’s toyed with the idea of going over entirely to keg beer and in 1976 installed modern, enclosed conical fermenters to make it.</p> \n<p>It was widely believed in the industry at the time that real ale could not be brewed in conicals because the special yeast cultures used would be adversely affected by both the shape of the vessels and the colder temperatures employed. Reg experimented with the new vessels and came to the conclusion that if you adjusted the temperatures and regularly used fresh batches of ale yeast, it would be perfectly possible to produce cask beer in them.</p> \n<p>His work in perfecting such key brands as Chiswick Bitter, London Pride and Extra Special Bitter (ESB) in the conical vessels turned them into successful and greatly admired beers. Each has been named champion beer of Britain in the Campaign for Real Ale’s annual awards. ESB won the title in 1978, 1981 and 1985 and has also won the strong ale category in the championship seven times, more than any other beer.</p> \n<p>Son of Lt-Col Hugh Drury and his wife Geraldine, Reg was born in Cairo, where his father was stationed in the army. After the second world war, the Drury family returned to Britain and settled in Surrey. Reg went to Lancing college in West Sussex, where he developed an enduring love for classical music and opera, and became an accomplished pianist. From Lancing, he went to study brewing at Heriot-Watt and then joined Fuller’s as a junior brewer. He became head brewer and eventually director of brewing, with a seat on the board.</p> \n<p>Reg’s dedicated skill in turning Fuller’s into a thoroughly modern brewery that is also steeped in tradition has turned the company into one of the most successful independent producers in Britain.</p> \n<p>He was also an innovator. As John Keeling, his successor as director of brewing, says, he dug deep into the Fuller’s recipe books to revive such old styles as London Porter, and he also had the foresight to develop bottle-conditioned beers – beers with active yeast – that will age and improve over several years.</p> \n<p>When he launched Fuller’s “1845” ale in 1995 and Vintage Ale two years later, sales of bottled beer were in decline. But Reg believed that naturally conditioned beers, with rich malt and hop flavours, would appeal to discerning drinkers. He wanted good beer to be treated with the reverence given to wine. His prescience can be judged by the boom in bottled beers in recent years: it is now a vibrant sector with several thousand beers produced in bottle-conditioned form.</p> \n<p>Reg was a devoted family man. He ran a succession of narrowboats on the English canals, enjoyed walking holidays in Scotland, Wales and Norway, and dedicated himself to a model railway at his home.</p> \n<p>But brewing remained his passion. When he retired from Fuller’s, he became an assessor for Cask Marque, the industry-funded group that monitors the quality of real ale in the nation’s pubs. Statistics released just a few days after his death showed that sales of cask beer, the style he helped improve and foster, have grown appreciably in 2014 and 2015. Reg was good beer’s best friend.</p> \n<p>He is survived by his wife, Sarah, whom he married in 1974, and their children, Jonathan and Fiona.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Reginald Hugh Drury, brewer, born 10 March 1939; died 7 June 2015</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434635307503/Reg-Drury-former-head-bre-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters Photograph: family picture","credit":"family picture","altText":"Reg Drury, former head brewer at Fuller's","cleanCaption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters Photograph: family picture"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T15:30:18Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T15:33:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[{"name":"Roger Protz","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/roger-protz"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Beer","Food & drink","Life and style","Food & drink industry","London","Pubs"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/beer","webTitle":"Beer"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"business/fooddrinks","webTitle":"Food & drink industry"},{"id":"uk/london","webTitle":"London"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/pubs","webTitle":"Pubs"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Roger Protz","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/roger-protz"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/18/reg-drury","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4av64","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/18/reg-drury","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/18/reg-drury"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434635307503/Reg-Drury-former-head-bre-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters ","credit":"Family picture","altText":"Reg Drury, former head brewer at Fuller's","cleanCaption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters "}},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434635307503/Reg-Drury-former-head-bre-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters Photograph: family picture","credit":"family picture","altText":"Reg Drury, former head brewer at Fuller's","cleanCaption":"Reg Drury proved that real ale could be brewed in modern fermenters Photograph: family picture"}}]},{"title":"The Hunter Valley wine region's cellar doors: eight of the best","rawTitle":"The Hunter Valley wine region's cellar doors: eight of the best","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/jun/17/the-hunter-valley-wine-regions-cellar-doors-eight-of-the-best","title":"The Hunter Valley wine region's cellar doors: eight of the best","trailText":"Just two hours north of Sydney, this popular region has scores of wineries to visit.

Ask to taste the Viognier and U &amp; I Shiraz.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"723983d67a0ad502a32aa8c5035cb2c80eefd6df\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434501617082/55ed903d-1274-48c3-ba6f-abcbaeec7365-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rural New South Wales\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You’re spoilt for choice in the picturesque wine regions of NSW.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bon Appetit/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Gundog Estate - 101 McDonald’s Road, Pokolbin NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Gundog Estate’s cellar door used to be the old Pokolbin schoolhouse, where local students would learn how to read and write and practice their times tables. Today, the schoolhouse has been transformed into a cellar door, where staff won’t give you detention if you’ve failed to learn the difference between a primary and secondary fermentation. <br /></p> \n<p>The cellar door is always busy on weekends with people tasting classic Hunter Valley wines with a contemporary twist. You will probably learn something about wine too, especially if winemaker Matt Burton and his offsider Nick are around. Ask to taste the Wild Semillon and new Indomitus range.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Bimbadgen Estate – 790 McDonalds Road, Pokolbin, NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Bimbadgen is an Indigenous word that means ‘many great views’, and that’s exactly what you’ll get when you visit this cellar door. Grab a glass of their viognier or shiraz and look out over panoramic views of the Brokenback range to the south and Barrington Tops to the north. Ask to taste the Estate Chardonnay and Estate Viognier.</p> \n<p><strong>Hart &amp; Hunter – 463 Deaseys Road, Pokolbin NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Tucked away on Deaseys road, you’ll find one of the Hunter’s newest wine labels. Hart &amp; Hunter don’t only have a great taste for wine, but music as well. Their sole focus is on Hunter Valley fruit, so you won’t find a sauvignon blanc here – just tremendous semillon, chardonnay and shiraz, native to the region. Ask to taste all of them!</p> \n<p><strong>Macquariedale –170 Sweetwater Road, Belford NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Biodynamic duo Ross and Derice McDonald were one of the first Hunter Valley winegrowers to be certified organic. They also grow and produce delicious garlic and olive oil on their Rothbury property, but it’s the wines that will give you a reason to stay. You can taste whites and reds in their gorgeous cellar door at the top of the hill while you watch the sun set over the Brokenback on a crisp, wintry afternoon. Ask to taste the verdelho and Thomas Shiraz.</p> \n<p><strong>Oakvale – 1596 Broke Road, Pokolbin NSW</strong></p> \n<p>The Oakvale label has been growing grapes and making wine in the Hunter Valley since the 1890s. second-generation winemaker Bob Elliot used to sell wine to Maurice O’Shea from up the road at Mount Pleasant. Today, the Becker family name is above the cellar door and their respect for Oakvale’s rich past is more evident than ever. Son James Becker recently took over the winemaking reins full time. He has a not-so-secret love for Hunter chardonnay, which is deliciously revealed in every glass. Ask to taste the Ablington Chardonnay and shiraz.</p> \n<p><br /><strong>Krinklewood – 712 Wollombi Road, Broke NSW</strong></p> \n<p>Krinklewood is one of the most peaceful destinations for wine in the whole Hunter Valley. Their cellar door is nestled beneath the foothills of the Brokenback range, in the sub-region of Broke, one of the region’s most charming places to visit. Echoing somewhere in France, Krinklewood’s vineyard has more than just grapevines. The sheep eat the weeds, the worms turn the soil, and Minty the dog stands watchful over all of it. Ask to taste the Francesca Ros&eacute; and Spiders Run White.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/8/14/1376464639582/A-vineyard-in-the-Hunter--011.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"TOURISM AUSTRALIA/PR IMAGE","altText":"A vineyard in the Hunter Valley ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: TOURISM AUSTRALIA/PR IMAGE"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a2985c4261f839df33f76c3af0b78f0997ea4515/0_0_2958_1777/2958.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1777,"width":2958,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There are more than 120 vineyards in the Hunter Valley region.

But there are some dishes that as a nation we recognise as quintessentially Australian – and they’ve started to pop up on menus from Brixton to Brooklyn.</p> \n<p>Tori Haschka, author of A Suitcase and a Spatula: Recipes and Stories from Around the World, says Australia’s spreading culinary influence can be put down to Australians’ love of travel.</p> \n<p>Wherever we go, she says, we like to share what’s best about our country. “That includes our fresh and sometimes laconic approach to food,” she says. “There’s a great focus on texture in Australian food; from the silkiness of the cap of milk in a flat white, the plushness of smashed avocado on crunchy toast or the bristle of coconut on a lamington.”</p> \n<p>Ken Burgin, restaurant consultant at Profitable Hospitality, says looking closely at other countries highlights what makes Australian dishes special. </p> \n<p>“I’ve just been in Italy for a month and it seems nothing there ever changes – good in some ways, and quite dull after a while,” he says. “Maybe our careful experiments with honest ingredients are what’s defining a distinctive Australian cuisine?”</p> \n<p>Here are five Aussie dishes and beverages now taking the world by storm:<br /></p> \n<h2>1. Flat white</h2> \n<p>Australia’s favourite coffee is fast usurping the cappuccino and latte as the drink of choice at cafes around the world. You can now order a flat white at Fondation Cafe in Paris and Little Collins in New York. The abundance of flat whites is such that <a href=\"http://www.fastcompany.com/3042927/why-starbuckss-new-drink-the-flat-white-is-made-of-hot-marketing-and-foam\">FastCompany</a> has dubbed the flat white “the latest must-sip beverage”. </p> \n<p> Now even Starbucks in the US is on the bandwagon, serving flat whites to millions of bewildered Americans who are not even sure what a flat white is (read <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/06/starbucks-flat-white-australia-coffee\">David Marr’s review</a> of the Starbuck’s flat white). Its popularity is such that some outlets are reported to have taken cappuccinos off the menu. In an act of community service Australia’s Hugh Jackman tried to explain the flat white as “like a latte with a little less milk and more espresso”. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33a3d539aca98dcb80979d3d3e8e362dcd519c0a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/33a3d539aca98dcb80979d3d3e8e362dcd519c0a/0_0_5100_3523/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The classic flat white – started in Australia, and has taken over the world\" width=\"1000\" height=\"691\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The classic flat white.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Cavalier/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>2. Smashed avocado on toast<br /></h2> \n<p>It’s rare these days to find a cafe in Australia that doesn’t serve smashed avocado (usually with chunky salt, pepper, lemon and perhaps feta). Now the rest of the world has woken up to the joys of “nature’s butter”. You can order “smashed avocado with streaky bacon” at Lantana in London or avocado smash with poached eggs, ricotta and radishes at the Cupping Room in Hong Kong. </p> \n<p>Diners love avocado for its health benefits and creamy taste while the appeal to chefs and cafe owners everywhere is immediately obvious: avocado smash is low on labour and high on profit margins. All you need is a fork and a squeeze of lemon – and a perfect avocado – and you’re in business.</p> \n<p>The smashing refers to mashing it up roughly with a fork, as opposed to slicing it or puree-ing it.</p> \n<h2>3. Sticky date pudding<br /></h2> \n<p>Sticky toffee pudding is a traditional British dessert beloved of gastropubs around the UK, but the Australian twist – sticky date pudding – is becoming an increasingly popular variation. </p> \n<p>It’s worth noting that some British sticky toffee puddings actually contain dates but they are finely diced, disguising their presence, whereas in Australia the date is loud and proud. It’s irrelevant, anyway, as everyone knows sticky date pudding isn’t really about the dates at all but the lashings of caramel sauce it comes smothered in. </p> \n<p>The Corner House in Bali serves up sticky date pudding with caramel and salty butter ice cream while Five Leaves in New York offers sticky date more traditionally, with the sole accompaniment of vanilla ice cream. </p> \n<p>Hashka says Australia’s reinvention of the dish has eclipsed the original’s popularity. “Sticky date is a much more practical moniker,” she says. “Of course it’s going to be sticky if it’s got toffee in it it. </p> \n<p>“But if there are dates in there, best let us know about them up front. It’s a straight down the line approach to food that makes sense.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b39eda5f1816a5de76a2ee4a35a94cce7877655f\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b39eda5f1816a5de76a2ee4a35a94cce7877655f/0_0_4064_2438/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sticky date pudding with icecream.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sticky date pudding with ice cream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>4. Corn fritters</h2> \n<p>Bill Granger has built an international empire on the back of his sweet corn breakfast fritters and other cafe owners have taken note.</p> \n<p>Granger’s version is made with flour, eggs, milk, fresh corn, herbs and a pinch of paprika, delivering a savoury dish with pops of sweetness from the corn. But you can find any number of interpretations of the corn fritter on cafe menus from Lantana in London to <a href=\"http://www.bluestonelaneny.com/\">Blue Stone Lane in New York</a>.</p> \n<p>For Nicholas Stone, Bluestone Lane’s owner, the corn fritter is a “quintessentially Aussie” dish. Bluestone Lane serves its fritters with with avo smash, smoked salmon, poached egg, beetroot relish and rocket. He says there’s no “exact science” behind New Yorker’s sudden insatiable desire for the corn fritter but thinks it coincides with an appreciation for more sophisticated cafe menu items among New Yorkers.</p> \n<p>“This is quite a non-traditional brunch dish that they are quite curious about,” he says. “It’s very aesthetically pleasing and delicious.” In the Instagram age that does count.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"787f80618495a03d2ef46db874d0aafd0c3218e5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433897430767/a88bc2a9-ce8c-4182-a57f-473b43daaf5a-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Corn fritters – good with eggs or as a snack later in the day.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Corn fritters – good with eggs or as a snack later in the day.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><p>5. Lamingtons</p></h2> \n<p>The delights of fluffy sponge cake, jammy filling, chocolate coating and dessicated coconut are going global. Now lamingtons are on offer at the Two Blur Guys cafe in Singapore while in London it’s hard to avoid Australia’s favourite cake. It’s a must-order item at Ozone Espresso in Shoreditch, east London, and Kaffeine in Fitzrovia in central London, doesn’t just sell lamingtons – it sells “pimped-up cushions of sponge”. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-828515c8-f9bb-4c24-bba5-d34932842a80\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434326775981/9dcb6989-b75f-4742-a0a8-be1dc05fae8d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chocolate lamingtons – delicious cushions of sponge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chocolate lamingtons – delicious cushions of sponge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kate Whitaker for Observer Food Monthly</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><br /></h2>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b1976999ced1910e697400b515710a19303cf085/0_38_720_432/720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":432,"width":720,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"bonappetit.com","altText":"Avocado on toast.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: bonappetit.com"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/33a3d539aca98dcb80979d3d3e8e362dcd519c0a/0_0_5100_3523/5100.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3523,"width":5100,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The classic flat white.

Here are three wines that show off some of its more daring and interesting selections</p>","byline":"David Williams","body":"<p><strong>Caruso &amp; Minini Perricone, Sicily, Italy 2013 (&pound;8, </strong><a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/c/food-and-wine/wine-shop\" title=\"\"><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Last time I had a look in the M&amp;S men’s fashion department it was reassuringly fusty, stocked with slacks and sensible jumpers of the kind that Alan Partridge would be happy to wear with his driving gloves. I’m reliably informed that things are a bit different on the women’s floor, where the retailer recently had a high-fashion hit with a certain &pound;200 suede skirt. When it comes to confounding M&amp;S’s safe and sensible reputation, however, it’s the wine department that seems to be closest to the cutting edge. It’s certainly way ahead of the other supermarkets when it comes to stocking grape varieties, regions and styles outside the mainstream, this brilliantly vivid, herby, dark cherry-scented Sicilian red being a particularly delicious example.</p> \n<p><strong>Domaine de la Pinte Arbois Chardonnay, Jura, France 2011 (&pound;16, </strong><a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/c/food-and-wine/wine-shop\" title=\"\"><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Things get most interesting – and divisive – with the whites, where M&amp;S has been keeping up with the hipsters in Hackney wine bars and Peckham pop-up restaurants by bringing in wines made in clay pots, or amphorae. There were two on the list at its most recent press tasting: Tbilvino Qvevris 2012 (&pound;9), a Georgian wine with a distinctly orange tinge, red wine-like tannin, orange citrus pith, and cherry-pit bite; and the sherry-like, nutty-savoury, Fresquito Vino Nuevo de Tinaja, Montilla-Moriles, Spain 2014 (&pound;9). Both are well worth a look if you’re prepared for something a bit unusual, as is the funky, slightly feral, ripe orchard fruit of the Domaine de la Pinte chardonnay from none-more-trendy eastern French region, the Jura.</p> \n<p><strong>Litmus White Pinot, Surrey, England 2011 (&pound;22, </strong><a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/c/food-and-wine/wine-shop\" title=\"\"><strong>Marks &amp; Spencer</strong></a><strong>) </strong>If the two amphora wines are challenging, and potentially confusing, in being categorised as white wines but including some of the flavours and textures of either red wines or sherry, Litmus White Pinot bends genders by making a white wine from a red grape, pinot noir. Like blanc de noirs champagne, a white fizz that is also made from pinot noir (and pinot meunier), the juice is removed from the skins before it has a chance to take on any colour (or tannin). It’s then aged in oak barrels to create one of the most successful still English wines I’ve come across, a wine where the spice and plump fruit of an Alsace white pinot gris combines with typically exhilarating English acidity.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433937586549/m-and-s-wines-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Top Marks: two great whites and a vibrant red from the high street retailer.","credit":"/PR","altText":"m and s wines","cleanCaption":"Top Marks: two great whites and a vibrant red from the high street retailer."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-14T04:59:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-14T04:59:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[{"name":"David Williams","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/david-williams"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Wine","Food & drink","Life and style","Marks & Spencer"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"business/marksspencer","webTitle":"Marks & Spencer"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"David Williams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/david-williams"}}],"series":{"title":"David Williams's wines of the week","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/david-williams-wines-of-the-week"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/14/wines-from-marks-and-spencer-david-williams","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kdx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/14/wines-from-marks-and-spencer-david-williams","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/14/wines-from-marks-and-spencer-david-williams"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433937586549/m-and-s-wines-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Top Marks: two great whites and a vibrant red from the high street retailer.","credit":"/PR","altText":"m and s wines","cleanCaption":"Top Marks: two great whites and a vibrant red from the high street retailer."}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Review"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433937586549/m-and-s-wines-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Top Marks: two great whites and a vibrant red from the high street retailer.","credit":"/PR","altText":"m and s wines","cleanCaption":"Top Marks: two great whites and a vibrant red from the high street retailer."}}]},{"title":"Readers’ Recipe Swap: summer cocktails","rawTitle":"Readers’ Recipe Swap: summer cocktails","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/summer-cocktail-recipes-gin-fizz-pomsecco-vodka","title":"Readers’ Recipe Swap: summer cocktails","trailText":"<strong>This week’s summer cocktails recipes</strong> have been keeping us cool – if not clear – on what we hope will be the start of many long summer evenings...","standFirst":"<p>This week’s summer cocktail recipes have been keeping us cool – if not clear – on what we hope will be the start of many long summer evenings...<br /><br />...and next time we would like to see your recipes for <strong>dressings.</strong>.. <br />For your chance to be crowned Guardian home cook of the year, send us your recipes for dressings.

There’s rarely a better way to spend a sunny evening than outdoors, drink in hand, with friends and family; however grateful they were on the night, though, the blame for fuzzy heads laid firmly at my door the next day. All more than worth it, of course, to test these stellar cocktail recipes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/07/cocktails-recipe-swap-felicity-cloake\">Readers' recipe swap: Cocktails | Felicity Cloake</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Proceedings began with Angela Dawson’s rhubarb and custard; the sweet syrup and heady vanilla vodka was perfectly balanced by the bitterness of tonic water; aromatic and delicate, it dispelled any preconceptions of it being as sweet as the name suggests. Next came withmustard’s vodka thyme lemonade; I failed to track down the citric acid, so rimmed the glass with the sugar and thyme mix instead. The result was an impressively sophisticated drink with minimal fuss - definitely one for the recipe scrapbook for all year round. The masala chai and mint rum infusion from binnyshah made for something deliciously complex, worth trying for the wonderful smell of the infused rum alone. Fadime Tiskaya’s pomsecco took a little longer to prepare, but would be a great welcome drink for any guests you might have this summer, the sharpness of the lime and tonic offsetting the sweet peaches, pomegranate and prosecco, something altogether more interesting than the usual bellini. A grapefruit tea with whiskey from TwinnyDip, filled with bitter and smoky notes, was super-refreshing on a warm day, as was Paddy MacLachlan’s take on the Mexican michelada. Tomato juice, beer and soy sauce may not be to everyone’s taste, but personally, I could drink it by the gallon.</p> \n<p>As hard as it was to pick a winner, once my powers of reasoning were restored, Clairetweet’s ruby gin fizz ticked all the boxes. Using seasonal fruits with a refreshing zip of lime and a few generous splashes of gin, it’s an unmistakable taste of summer that’s as easy to make as it is to drink.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/10/henry-dimbleby-drinks-peach-slushie\">Make your own peach slushie </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>The winning recipe: ruby gin fizz</strong></h2> \n<p>Really, nothing could be easier than a gin fizz.

I’ve been making it regularly ever since, as rhubarb cordial has a wonderful flavour, a brilliant colour and keeps well for a week or so in the fridge; we’ve mixed it with gin and cava before now, but this is our favourite creation.<br /><em>Angela Dawson, Taunton</em></p> \n<p><strong>Makes enough cordial for 8 drinks<br /></strong><strong>For the cordial<br /></strong>400-450g rhubarb, chopped<br />250g sugar<br />Juice of &frac12; a lemon<br />500ml water</p> \n<p><strong>For the cocktails<br /></strong>1 part vanilla vodka (which you can buy, or make by steeping a vanilla pod in good quality vodka for a couple of months)<br />2 parts rhubarb cordial<br />3 parts tonic water</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Put the rhubarb, sugar, lemon and water in a pan, bring to a boil, then simmer until the rhubarb has disintegrated. Cool, strain through muslin into a jug for a few hours and chill.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> To make the cocktail, mix 1 part vanilla vodka to 2 parts cordial and 3 parts tonic water, pour into glasses with or without ice, then serve.</p> \n<h2><strong>Pomsecco</strong></h2> \n<p>This cocktail is inspired by two of my favourite fruits: I love pomegranate in every possible way; peach on the other hand was my favourite fruit as a child (and still is). The combination of the two with the prosecco makes a wonderful grown-up drink.
