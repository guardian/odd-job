That’s why we drink coffee out. But classes are springing up in Melbourne and Sydney, teaching mere mortals how to be baristas at home.<br /></p> \n<p>Nolan Hirte, owner of inner-city Melbourne cafes <a href=\"http://www.proudmarycoffee.com.au/\">Proud Mary</a>, <a href=\"http://staggerlees.com.au/\">Stagger Lees</a> and <a href=\"http://www.broadsheet.com.au/melbourne/food-and-drink/directory/cafe/aunty-pegs-coffee-proud-mary\">Aunty Peg’</a>s, admits not everyone wants to do all that, but if people knew how easy it was to make it properly at home, “your coffee would be so much better.”</p> \n<p>In his most recently opened cafe, Aunty Peg’s in Collingwood, Hirte has set up what he calls the <a href=\"mailto:auntypegs@proudmarycoffee.com.au\"> Genius Bar</a>. </p> \n<p>Four different machines – French Press, AeroPress, Clever Dripper and V60 – are set up along a long wooden bench, allowing customers to come in and be trained by Hirte or one of his staff. “It’s free advice,” says Hirte. “There are many factors to making a good coffee but, once you know them, it’s easy to do it.” </p> \n<p>So here I am, a coffee drinker and a lazy one at that. I don’t weigh the water and I don’t always grind my beans at home, so I’m here to learn how. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ea68c4794ee2ab5c28c3542a8d75c3d0992c294\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8ea68c4794ee2ab5c28c3542a8d75c3d0992c294/0_160_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"There’s more than one way to skin a cat: the pour-over, chemex, aeropress, and vacuum pot. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There’s more than one way to skin a cat: the pour-over, Chemex, AeroPress and vacuum pot. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Edmund D. Fountain/ZUMA Press/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>French press</h2> \n<p>We start with the French press, aka the coffee plunger. The grind size is vital, according to Hirte. We are making two cups, and as it’s 15-18g of beans for one cup of coffee (one cup being 250 ml), I weigh out 30g of beans into a silver cup on a highly sensitive digital scale. The bean we use is Ethiopian Yirgacheffe and we use the same bean for each extraction method.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/apr/02/expensive-specialty-coffee-how-much-would-you-be-prepared-to-pay\">Expensive specialty coffee: how much would you be prepared to pay?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Before we go any further we preheat the plunger, just as you would warm a teapot in anticipation of a good brew, with a pour of hot water. The glass takes on the heat and we put the vessel aside.<br /></p> \n<p>Hirte puts the beans that will become our coffee on a grind that is coarser than table salt. <br /></p> \n<p>I place the plunger on the digital scales, then put in the ground coffee and bring the scales back to zero. I weigh the just-boiled water – 500g equals 500ml – pouring it into the plunger and ensuring all the grounds are saturated. We give the mix a stir. </p> \n<p>Hirte puts the timer on for three and a half minutes. “Leave it for longer if you want a stronger brew,” he says. Time’s up and we have a delicious cup of black coffee. It’s fruity, a little nutty and delicate. Not adding milk only emphasises this flavour profile. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"410da25c0d6dbff08dfdb8e25924dab76f8b483e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/410da25c0d6dbff08dfdb8e25924dab76f8b483e/0_0_2848_4276/666.jpg\" alt=\"An old favourite – French press coffee.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An old favourite – French press coffee.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Drip coffee</h2> \n<p>“This got my mum to stop drinking Moccona,” says Hirte. “It’s really clever.” </p> \n<p>The Clever Coffee Dripper is a device that makes a single cup of filtered coffee. With the filter paper, coffee and water poured into the dripper, the extraction happens when the dripper is placed on top of the cup and the coffee is released via a weight-controlled valve. It’s like a filter coffee maker for a single cup rather than a large jug. “This allows us to brew quicker – with the press we had to wait four minutes with this – you just press it when you’re ready and get on with it,” says Hirte.</p> \n<p>This time, I weigh out 14g of coffee, we grind it a little finer than we did for the French press and put the ground coffee into wet filter paper in the dripper. Hirte wets the filter paper, “as we don’t want to taste paper in the coffee”. We put the device on the scale and weigh the water again directly over the ground coffee in the filter paper. <br /></p> \n<p>We only need 250g of water for the one cup and cover the top of the dripper to let the flavours mingle. After two and a half minutes, or however long you want it, place it on the cup and the valve will release the brew. The flavour is denser than you get with the plunger.</p> \n<p>This device is available in any specialty coffee shop that sells equipment, and retails at $20-$35 or <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Coffee-Shrub-Clever-Dripper-C70777/dp/B00EOM5RN0\">on Amazon</a>. </p> \n<h2>AeroPress</h2> \n<p>The AeroPress has garnered its own loyal following in the last few years and I can’t help but wonder what the fuss is about. Hirte says it’s a quick and efficient method of extraction that gets good results.</p> \n<p>This time I measure out 12g of beans for one cup of coffee. I hit 12.1g and Hirte says it’s fine to be slightly over. He preheats the AeroPress and the vessel that will hold the finished coffee and we weigh out the coffee. It is a fine grind. We put the AeroPress and ground coffee on the scales. As we measure out 200ml of water, he says, “Spot on, and then we give it a good stir.” </p> \n<p>After one and a half minutes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQ8wvUKa35E \">we flip the device</a>, “like flipping a cake” Hirte says, and we push down gently on the AeroPress. The extraction is through pressure and it brings out a slightly different aroma again. There’s more depth to the smell and it’s a little richer on the palate. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"341044f34e75c4f58449f70739594280abc63444\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/341044f34e75c4f58449f70739594280abc63444/0_0_2000_3000/667.jpg\" alt=\"The AeroPress method of brewing coffee.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The AeroPress method of brewing coffee.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>V60 (pour-over method)<br /></h2> \n<p>The name is reminiscent of a rev-head’s souped-up engine but it simply refers to the angle of the cone that filters the coffee. This is 21st-century filter coffee, also known as the pour-over method. </p> \n<p>This is Hirte’s favourite method. He makes himself coffee using this method every morning because “the quality and clarity in the cup are really good”.</p> \n<p>I’ve found my rhythm now. I know I will be heating vessels first, weighing beans and weighing water. Hirte says this method is a “bit more involved and you can get this wrong”, although I feel confident we can do it. </p> \n<p>We weigh out the coffee again and we need 28g for two cups. We go 29g – why? “I want more strength in the flavour,” he says. Half a gram can change the strength markedly. “You can weigh out 32g if you want to but it will make it very strong, a tiny change can make a big difference.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eff43284270725e00652ebf01995c5494750229\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0eff43284270725e00652ebf01995c5494750229/0_2940_3456_2074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A barista preparing coffee using the V60 in Kuala Lumpur. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A barista preparing coffee using the V60 in Kuala Lumpur. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sam Ruslan/Demotix/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hirte pours 80ml of water over the ground coffee. He’s using a kettle with a long thin spout. “The way you pour is very important, you can’t do this with a normal kettle,” he says. He explains that pouring a large amount of water quickly over the grounds can cause “dry patches in the coffee, and it won’t filter properly. Begin in the centre and work the water out to the edges in a circular motion.” <br /></p> \n<p>I pour the next amount, about 100ml, and Hirte finishes off. We stir the coffee and water and it takes about two minutes to filter through. It has the best flavour of all the brews, rich and rounded. I can see why this is his preferred method. </p> \n<p>I have come to the conclusion that Hirte’s right. I am lazy. I don’t know if I will change my ways or just keep coming to places like this to have my coffee weighed and made for me. I’m considering a Clever Drip for home but may find that hard to move away from my stovetop. The new methods I’ve learned are fascinating but old habits are hard to beat. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e1191ab2e509cd850d47c7feb3b9337aaf073d25/0_78_5472_3284/5472.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3284,"width":5472,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Nan Palmero/Flickr","altText":"Pour Over Coffee with a Hario V60 at Fourteen Eighteen Cafe in USA.

It’s not the sort of place you’d go looking for a natural wine from a tiny producer, just as you wouldn’t go to a chain of butcher’s calling itself Cheap Chicken to pick up an organic free-range bird. But if you have a brand you’re fond of, it’s worth at least checking in at one of BB’s 618 stores – the price of Ravenswood’s consistently sumptuous red, for example, stacks up very well against retailing rivals great and small.</p> \n<p><strong>Otra Vida Malbec, Mendoza, Argentina 2014 (&pound;4.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bargainbooze.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bargain Booze</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Having tasted a small sample of wines on offer at a recent tasting put on by Bargain Booze’s owners, Conviviality Retail, and then nosed around the BB website, I’ve found you have to do a fair bit of digging through some very ordinary stuff to get to the odd gem. The BB range leans heavily on the noxiously sweet and industrial, inexplicably bestselling stuff like Yellowtail, Barefoot and Apothic, or lesser-known names such as the aptly named Crimes Red, Australia 2014 (&pound;7.99), the jarring jammy sweetness of which left my palate feeling violated. The hunt is worthwhile, though: the fragrant, juicy raspberry and cherry of Otra Vida Malbec, from the Argentine operation of Chilean producer Concha y Toro, is, at less than a fiver, a superb barbecue bottle.</p> \n<p><strong>Kosi Bay Sauvignon Blanc, Western Cape, South Africa 2014 (&pound;5.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bargainbooze.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bargain Booze</strong></a><strong>) </strong>A quid more than the Malbec, but equally good value, is this terrific Cape Sauvignon, which has all the leafy verve, passion fruit and lime I look for in this grape variety in a dry, racy style: highly recommended if you’re having a party over the summer. Even better in terms of quality is the wonderfully relaxed mature Baron de Ley Rioja Gran Reserva 2008. At &pound;19.99, I wouldn’t rush out to buy it, however. Especially when the decidedly more upmarket London merchant Roberson is offering the silkily smooth and savoury joys of Bodegas Las Orcas Decenio Rioja Reserva 2002 at just &pound;12.95. Now that really is some bargain booze.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352108660/wines-of-the-week-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for.","credit":"/PR","altText":"wines of the week","cleanCaption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T05:00:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T05:00:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":9,"contributors":[{"name":"David Williams","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/david-williams"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Wine","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"David Williams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/david-williams"}}],"series":{"title":"David Williams's wines of the week","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/david-williams-wines-of-the-week"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","navigationButtonColour":"#333333","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","quoteColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/good-wine-at-rock-bottom-prices-david-williams","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4af8q","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/good-wine-at-rock-bottom-prices-david-williams","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/good-wine-at-rock-bottom-prices-david-williams"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352108660/wines-of-the-week-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for.","credit":"/PR","altText":"wines of the week","cleanCaption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for."}},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"Review"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352108660/wines-of-the-week-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for.","credit":"/PR","altText":"wines of the week","cleanCaption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for."}}]},{"title":"A pub date with Lance, who describes himself as short, fat and bald","rawTitle":"A pub date with Lance, who describes himself as short, fat and bald","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/11/pub-date-short-plain-bald-man","title":"A pub date with Lance, who describes himself as short, fat and bald","trailText":"He’d bought a bottle of wine and was dressed as if about to go down a ravine with Bear Grylls","standFirst":"He’d bought a bottle of wine and was dressed as if about to go down a ravine with Bear Grylls","byline":"Stella Grey","body":"<p>Miles’s smiling face popped up on another dating site this week, one he’d freshly joined, and so I sent him a message via their system, just saying hello. He’d said he wanted to be friends. He didn’t, though.</p> \n<p>Back came the reply: “I’m sorry again that I disappeared on you. I felt overwhelmed. To be honest, all that stuff about wanting to be stitched into someone else’s life was kind of claustrophobic.”</p> \n<p>It wasn’t that, Miles. It was my body – tell the truth, I said aloud to the screen, but didn’t write. So it wasn’t really my not conforming to his type. It was my neediness that damned me.</p> \n<p>I asked what was wrong with wanting to be stitched into someone else’s life, if the stitching was mutual and contented. He said that living alone had taught him that he needs to be fundamentally independent. Shared meals, evenings, nights, should be a matter of choice: surely that was a truly liberated way of life? When I argued with this, he interpreted my scepticism as a proposition.</p> \n<p>“I can’t offer what you want,” he wrote. “And nice though it is to hear from you, I can’t offer you a date either.”</p> \n<p>I wasn’t looking for a date. “I’m not looking for a date, but thanks. Just saw your face pop up here and thought I’d say hello. All the best. Good luck.”</p> \n<p>When I logged into another website that I’m registered on, there was a message from him. He’d joined the day before, found me and written to say he thought we should have that lunch at his house and see what happens. But that was before we’d had the conversation we’d just had. “I don’t imagine this invitation still stands,” I replied. He did not answer.</p> \n<p>Then, there was an email from Lee, the Austrian, saying that he regretted we hadn’t met, in the end, and that we should have had the conversation about femininity face to face as it might have turned out differently. We would have smiled while we argued. We would have enjoyed the debate. Good relationships need friction, after all, he said. How about a drink? OK, I said. A drink. Why not. When, where? He didn’t reply. I wrote again. “Just name the day. Name the date.” Then I laughed a lot at my own joke.</p> \n<p>The culmination of this series of blasts from the past was a dating site message from Peter. It was as if I’d conjured him up by thinking about him, my long-distance disappointment of February. Peter has my email address and mobile number, but opted for the formality of the site email system.</p> \n<p>“Hello again. How’s it going for you?” he asked blandly. I told him it was going fine. He launched in to an account of his life since he’d kissed my head and got on a train and dumped me. He’d had a few short-term&nbsp;relationships. He’d thought he’d found “the one”, and then it turned out she wasn’t. They’d got on each other’s nerves. He’d realised that he needed to stop chasing the pretty girls and think about the intellectual fit. “And so – why are you contacting me again, Peter?” I asked him. “Have I been held in reserve until the wind changed?” There was no answer to&nbsp;that.</p> \n<p>I put on some lipstick and a red frock and went to the pub to meet Lance. Lance is short and plain and bald; he’d written a funny message admitting to these failings and listing his good points. (One was that he couldn’t make up his mind about Marmite, and thus was an original thinker, which made me smile.)</p> \n<p>At the pub, Lance was already ensconced in a corner and had bought a bottle of wine. We drank it. He was dressed as if he was about to go down into a ravine with Bear Grylls. We didn’t have much to talk about. Eventually he looked at his watch for the fourth time and said he had an early start, and should go home.</p> \n<p>Outside, he kissed me on the cheek, and said, “Look, I’m not sure, I have to be honest.”</p> \n<p>I said that was fine, and off we went in our different directions. That’s what most internet dates are like. That’s what most of mine are like. They are just not very interesting to read about.</p> \n<p><em>Stella Grey is a pseudonym</em></p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/greystellagrey\" title=\"\">@GreyStellaGrey</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436180452360/Jar-of-marmite-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lance argued that as he couldn't make up his mind about Marmite, he was an original thinker.

Pour over the wine and drinking vinegar, add a few cubes of ice and a twist of orange, stir and drink.</p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </strong>Ruth Spivey is wine buyer at <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk\">Craft London</a> and founder, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/winecarboot\">Wine Car Boot</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/1/1435759930966/Good-mixer-summer-cherry--008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Photograph: Dan Matthews for the Guardian","credit":"/Dan Matthews for the Guardian","altText":"Good mixer: summer cherry punch","cleanCaption":"  Photograph: Dan Matthews for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T17:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T16:27:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Life and style","Food & drink","Cocktails","Wine","Fruit"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/cocktails","webTitle":"Cocktails"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fruit","webTitle":"Fruit"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"The good mixer","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/the-good-mixer"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","quoteColour":"#fdadba","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/summer-cherry-punch-recipe-ruth-spivey","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3pa","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/summer-cherry-punch-recipe-ruth-spivey","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/summer-cherry-punch-recipe-ruth-spivey"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/1/1435759930966/Good-mixer-summer-cherry--008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Photograph: Dan Matthews for the Guardian","credit":"/Dan Matthews for the Guardian","altText":"Good mixer: summer cherry punch","cleanCaption":"  Photograph: Dan Matthews for the Guardian"}},"importance":4,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/1/1435759930966/Good-mixer-summer-cherry--008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Photograph: Dan Matthews for the Guardian","credit":"/Dan Matthews for the Guardian","altText":"Good mixer: summer cherry punch","cleanCaption":"  Photograph: Dan Matthews for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"The French fortified wine factory that got away\r\n","rawTitle":"The French fortified wine factory that got away","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/noilly-prat-vermouth-fortified-wine-factory-marseillan","title":"The French fortified wine factory that got away","trailText":"<strong>Empire of Drinks: </strong>The sad tale of how a trip to the home of Noilly Prat vermouth was thwarted, thanks to a spouse’s less-than-fortified stomach","standFirst":"<p>The sad tale of how a trip to the home of Noilly Prat vermouth was thwarted, thanks to a spouse’s less-than-fortified stomach</p>","byline":"Henry Jeffreys","body":"<p>The southern French port of Marseillan’s premier tourist attraction is the <a href=\"http://www.noillyprat.com/\">Noilly Prat</a> factory, where the world’s second most famous vermouth is made. I’ve been to Marseillan, and I love Noilly Prat, but I didn’t visit the premises because my wife was suffering from galloping morning sickness when we were there. One day I’d love to see where the magic happens – not least for the art nouveau spiral staircase designed by someone called Gustave Eiffel. I wonder what happened to him ...</p> \n<p>Instead, we stayed my aunt’s house in nearby Pom&eacute;rols. It wasn’t a bad way to spend a holiday – for me at least. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/19/vermouth-revival-masterclass-fortified-wine\">Vermouth revival: a masterclass in fortified wine</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>All around us were hectares of piquepoul vines (it’s wonderfully French that the grape is spelt differently to the wine). These grapes were originally planted to go into Noilly Prat, but declining vermouth sales meant that local farmers had to find a different outlet for them. Happily, they make an extremely good, piquant white wine. The word “piquepoul” means something like “lip sting” in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occitan_language\">Occitan</a>. </p> \n<p>The process of turning the piquepoul grapes into Noilly Prat is a complex one. Wine made from Clairette grapes is used as well – both are fortified and then left outside in barrels to bake and oxidise in the sun, where they take on that distinctive nutty, sherried taste. This unusual ageing process is shared with the fortified wines of Rivesaltes, Maury and Banyuls a bit further up the coast. The aged wines are then blended and steeped with herbs, spices and fruit peel and sweetened with a special flavoured mixture of alcohol and grape juice. <br /></p> \n<p>There’s a British link, too. The firm was founded in 1855 by Louis Noilly and his son-in-law Claudius Prat, who was from England. Therefore the T in Prat is pronounced. Noilly should be pronounced in the French way, though I just say “Noi Lee”, and nobody seems to mind. The ordinary dry Noilly Prat is superb in a martini, and great to cook with instead of sherry. They also make a rarer, red vermouth: it’s sweeter and more orangey, and it makes a good long drink with tonic and lemon. There’s also an ambre version, but I’ve never met anyone who has seen, let alone tried it.</p> \n<p>After a few days in Pom&eacute;rols, my wife and I were taken on a tour of the vineyards up in the hills around Faug&egrave;res by a couple who ran a tailored holiday business. Despite telling them about my wife’s fragile state, they insisted on taking us on long scenic routes involving hairpin bends. There was much vomiting. When we finally got to the B&amp;B, they had provided a meal consisting largely of raw meats, shellfish and unpasteurised cheeses. A trip to Noilly Prat would have been a picnic in comparison.<br /><em><br /></em></p> \n<ul> \n <li><em><em>Henry Jeffreys’ first book, Empire of Booze, will be published by Unbound in 2016. @henrygjeffreys</em><br /></em></li> \n</ul>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/56196c87d095141c94283c690bf8c73a11fbcb89/0_339_5120_3070/5120.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3070,"width":5120,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Owen Franken/Corbis","altText":"Harvester picking grapes in Pomérols, France","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Owen Franken/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T11:00:10Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T23:01:48Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Henry Jeffreys","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/henry-jeffreys"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Wine","Alcohol","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"},{"id":"society/alcohol","webTitle":"Alcohol"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Henry Jeffreys","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/henry-jeffreys"}}],"series":{"title":"Empire of drinks","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/empire-of-drinks"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","quoteColour":"#fdadba","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/noilly-prat-vermouth-fortified-wine-factory-marseillan","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agbz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/noilly-prat-vermouth-fortified-wine-factory-marseillan","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/10/noilly-prat-vermouth-fortified-wine-factory-marseillan"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/56196c87d095141c94283c690bf8c73a11fbcb89/0_339_5120_3070/5120.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3070,"width":5120,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The process from harvesting the grapes to making Noilly Prat is a long and complex one … and destined to remain mysterious to Henry.
