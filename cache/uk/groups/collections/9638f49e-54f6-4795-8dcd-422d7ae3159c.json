I’m thinking of salmon, as well as grilled meat. But with their distinctive mix of red fruit, graphite, floral fragrance, acidity and chalky tannic bite, and their generally low alcohol, the wines take well to being chilled and served with cold meats and cheese, too. Those closest to my personal ideal of cab franc are both from the Saumur-Champigny appellation: the raspberry-scented Domaine Filliatreau Classique 2013 and the perfectly modulated cherries of Ch&acirc;teau du Hureau’s 2012.</p> \n<p><strong>Charles Joguet Cuvee Terroir, Chinon France 2012 (&pound;13.80, </strong><a href=\"http://www.tanners-wines.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Tanners Wines</strong></a><strong>)</strong> Working at the northern limit of red-wine production, the Loire’s cabernet franc growers have in the past struggled to get sufficiently ripe grapes, leading to an aggressive tang of green pepper and lack of substance. But while the wines are never going to be big blockbusters, I found little evidence of those herbaceous qualities in those I tasted. And even in difficult vintages, such as 2012 and 2013, the better growers, such as Charles Joguet, are capable of making complex, elegant wines such as Clos de la Dioterie 2012 as well as vibrant, limpid reds like Cuv&eacute;e Terroir.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540948987/FRANCE-LOIRE-VALLEY-CHATE-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reflected glory: Chateau Chambord, one of the many grand buildings dotted along the Loire.

While it is unlikely that any actual billionaires are in attendance (few of the moneyed elite would deign to take direction in such a public forum on matters as important as wine) avid gourmets and oenophiles patiently waited with budding anticipation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68172eff3c739fa493d9a727955865e3d4560cdc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434812297547/b17357a8-06a6-4cf2-abc9-194e75704e4d-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"wine aspen\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Oldman with the expensive stuff.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Oldman</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As the crowd filtered in, there was a buzz in the room. Each guest took a seat behind a series of six unmarked wines, two white and four red. </p> \n<p>After a few minutes, Oldman burst upon the stage, dressed in a rakish purple smoking jacket, with a wooden pipe hanging from his mouth. “If you went out and bought bottles of the wines that are in these glasses it would cost you at least $2,000,” he said. “I would venture to guess that these may be the most expensive wines ever poured at a consumer tasting.” With that, the crowd sat up a little taller and stared at the bounty, and beauty, in the glasses before them. </p> \n<p>Oldman began leading the assembled through a tasting of exceptional wines, beginning with the 2005 Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs.<strong> </strong>“This wine is made from the best grapes in only the very best vintages,” he explained<strong tabindex=\"-1\">.</strong>“One hundred percent chardonnay in a Blanc de Blancs, no pinot noir, just pure Chard.” The crowd sipped their bubbles and nodded in approval. “When is the best time to drink champagne?” he asked the audience. “Always!” the audience shouted in response.</p> \n<p>Next up was the 2005 Cos d’Estournel, a young bordeaux. “This is a Super Second,” he says as he briefly explains the Classification of 1855 pecking order. “What do you taste?” “Bong water!” screamed a man in the crowd. Oldman chuckled. “Only in Colorado,” he said in reference to the state’s recently relaxed cannabis regulations.</p> \n<p>The tasting continued through epic wines from Italy, Australia and California’s Napa Valley. As the vibe loosened further, thanks to the 7,900ft elevation, the early hour and the high-octane red wines, Oldman unsheathed a saber. “What’s the best time for champagne?” he bellowed again. “Always!” his audience replied, and a massive three-litre bottle of NV Champagne Barons de Rothschild Brut appeared onstage. </p> \n<p>Begin with bubbles and close with bubbles. That’s how the billionaires do it.</p> \n<p><strong>The wines (as stated by the presenter)</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1aa5b18671590ca580e82853c8dd5d24dda1102e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434812173319/028355b4-d3c6-4517-a398-a5ee699d4919-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"wine aspen\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wines.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Oldman</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>2005 Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs, $180/bottle: </strong>A defining Blanc de Blancs from a house that was founded in 1743<strong> </strong></p> \n<p><strong>2005 Ch&acirc;teau Cos d’Estournel, $360: </strong>Any self-respecting billionaire requires bordeaux in the cellar.
