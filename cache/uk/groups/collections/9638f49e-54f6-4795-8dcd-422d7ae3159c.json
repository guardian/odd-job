Much of the work involved in this summery menu can be done in advance. All you have to do when your guests turn up is chuck a couple of ingredients on the barbecue and toss together a salad. That leaves you plenty of time to enjoy being outside as much as possible. Have fun.</p> \n<h2><strong>Grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7431b8da468f23e6cbdd701b01b8b697042df51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435682683820/a9176f92-f820-4d11-bbbe-7c605c8a9775-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds: ‘A perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Halloumi is a wonder ingredient, and at its best when introduced to some heat, ideally flame. Here, slices of halloumi are whipped straight from the barbecue to the platter (it doesn’t do sitting around very well), then tossed with juicy peaches, wafer-thin ribbons of courgette and almonds fried in butter. It’s a perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors. Serves six to eight.</p> \n<p><strong>6 small courgettes<br />4 peaches, peeled, stoned and cut into thickish wedges<br />1 big handful mint leaves, roughly chopped<br />Juice of 1 large lemon<br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />20g butter<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />50g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped<br />&frac14; tsp paprika <br />500g halloumi, cut into 1cm-thick slices</strong></p> \n<p>Light the barbecue an hour before you want to eat (failing that, use a griddle pan). Peel the courgettes into long, thin strips with a vegetable peeler, rotating them as you do so and stopping before you get to the seedy centre (keep the middles for stewing in olive oil for a soup or side dish the next day). Put the ribbons in a salad bowl with the peach wedges, mint, lemon juice and three tablespoons of oil, toss gently but thoroughly and set aside.</p> \n<p>Put a small frying pan on a medium heat, add the butter and season generously. Swirling the pan constantly, melt the butter and cook for two to three minutes, until it starts darkening. Add the chopped almonds and paprika, cook for another minute or two, until the butter is a dark, biscuity colour and the almonds are golden, then scatter over the salad.</p> \n<p>Rub the slices of halloumi in the remaining tablespoon of oil, then lay on the hottest part of the barbecue (or on a heated griddle pan). Grill for 30-60 seconds on each side, until char marks appear and the cheese softens. Cut each halloumi slice in half, toss into the salad and taste: you may want a scrunch of black pepper, a sprinkling of sea salt, a squeeze more lemon or a touch more olive oil. Adjust accordingly and serve at once.</p> \n<p><strong>Barbecued rabbit (or chicken) with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f5933327bd4f4f84001da3641c975c1790570dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683145236/ea3b7813-2416-484d-a2aa-b7db15f5dcfc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli: ‘Sensational.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve used free-range farmed rabbit here, which is really tender and tasty, but skin-on chicken thighs or even a whole spatchcocked chicken will work just as well. The combination of the black, herby rub, sweet tomatoes and garlicky mayonnaise is sensational. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>3 bunches fresh thyme, 1 bunch picked and finely chopped<br />1 bunch fresh mint<br />5 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped <br />Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 farmed rabbits, jointed into 8 pieces (or chicken thighs)<br />80ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 punnets cherry tomatoes, halved<br />A few splashes red-wine vinegar </strong></p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli<br /><strong>2 egg yolks<br />1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed to a paste with a little salt<br />1 tsp Dijon mustard<br />750ml mild olive oil <br />Juice of &frac12; lemon</strong></p> \n<p>Put the barbecue on about an hour before you want to eat. Put two dry frying pans on a medium-high heat and divide between them two of the bunches of thyme and the mint. Dry-toast the herbs, shaking the pan every so often, until they have blackened and the room is smelling fragrant – about 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Put two-thirds of the garlic, the chopped thyme and a big pinch of salt in a mortar and bash with a pestle until you have a green paste (or use a food mixer). Pull the leaves from the burnt herbs, add these to the mortar and bash again until broken down and thoroughly mixed in. You should now have a blackish rub. Season generously, transfer to a large bowl and mix in the lemon zest. Add the rabbit pieces and rub them all over with the marinade.</p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli, put the egg yolks, garlic, mustard and a generous pinch of salt into a food processor and blitz briefly. With the motor running, very slowly drip the oil through the funnel of the processor, until the mayonnaise starts to thicken and emulsify, then pour in the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream. Loosen with lemon juice and a few tablespoons of water, season to taste and transfer to a bowl.</p> \n<p>Put the oil and the rest of the garlic in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Once the garlic begins to bubble in the oil, cook for a minute or two to soften, then stir in the tomatoes and season generously. Cover with a lid, turn the heat right down and poach gently for 10 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened. Season with the vinegar to taste, and set aside.</p> \n<p>Once the barbecue is ready (ie, when you can hold your hand over the coals for only about five seconds before it gets too hot for comfort), put the rabbit legs and shoulders on the grill. After five minutes, add the belly pieces and, five minutes later, the ribs and saddle. Turn the pieces frequently until charred all over, brushing them with any leftover marinade as they cook – it should take 15-20 minutes from start to finish. (To check that the meat is done, cut into a thick piece.) Pile the cooked rabbit on to a large plate, squeeze over some lemon juice, then spoon on the juicy tomatoes, followed by the a&iuml;oli. Serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26d235d0cb1ebf1d305499af9aa58c0efbe7239d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435744594796/393c318f-2ca4-4d4d-9391-486a1afcee3f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: 'Low in gluten.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: ‘Low in gluten.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This delicious cocoa-rye pastry comes from <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tartine-2.html\">Chad Robertson’s amazing book Tartine 3</a> (&pound;24.99, Chronicle Books). It gives the sweet cardamom custard a crisp, grown-up, dark chocolate edge. It’s also very low in gluten. Serve with a bowl of fresh raspberries alongside. You’ll need a 26cm tart tin. Serves 12-16.</p> \n<p>For the cocoa-rye pastry<strong><br />500g unsalted butter<br />200g caster sugar<br />1 large egg plus 1 yolk, at room temperature<br />&frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />280g rye flour, sifted<br />170g cocoa powder, sifted, plus extra for dusting</strong></p> \n<p>For the cardamom custard<strong><br />350ml whole milk<br />350ml double cream<br />6 cardamom pods, seeds crushed<br />Seeds from 1 vanilla pod<br />10 egg yolks<br />120g caster sugar</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. To make the pastry, beat the butter and sugar with a paddle mixer until soft and a pale cream colour – this will take a few minutes. Beat in the whole egg, then the yolk, and stop the mixer. Scrape down the sides and beat in the vanilla, followed by the flour and cocoa, until thoroughly combined. Transfer the pastry to a large piece of clingfilm, pat into a rectangle and refrigerate for at least an hour, until firm.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the custard. Put the milk, cream, cardamom, vanilla seeds and pod into a saucepan and bring to simmering point. Simmer gently for three minutes, then set aside for 10 minutes to infuse. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, until light and pale. Discard the vanilla pod, then whisk the warm milk into the eggs and pour into a jug.</p> \n<p>Divide the dough in two and freeze half for another day. Dust both sides of the remaining dough lightly with cocoa powder and roll out between two large pieces of baking paper or clingflim, rotating as you do, until it’s an even thickness of about 4mm. Carefully roll the pastry on to the rolling pin and transfer to a 26cm tart tin. Press firmly into all the corners of the tin, leaving an overhang of roughly 0.5cm. Trim off any excess dough.</p> \n<p>Freeze the pastry case for 15 minutes, then line with baking paper, fill with baking beans and blind bake for 20 minutes, until slightly puffed up. Remove the paper and beans, and bake for 10-15 minutes longer, until the case is completely cooked (take care not to burn it, so check after 10 minutes).</p> \n<p>Turn down the oven to 140C/285F/gas mark 1. Run a sharp knife along the edges of the tart shell to neaten it, then pour in the custard, filling it up right to the brim. Bake in the centre of the oven for about 50 minutes, until just set – it shouldn’t wobble in the centre when you gently shake the tin. Leave the tart to cool completely, and serve with fresh raspberries.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of

For instance, did you know that the Bee Gees have sold more than 200m records? That nearly 10 million people watched <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jan/02/tv-ratings-mrs-browns-boys-dethrones-queen\">the Mrs Brown’s Boys Christmas special</a>? Or that <a href=\"https://www.npdgroup.co.uk/wps/portal/npd/uk/news/press-releases/pubs-continue-to-build-on-food-success/\">less than one-in-10 visits to the pub</a> are now solely for the purpose of having a drink?</p> \n<p>“Sorry, come again?” you may ask of that last factoid, and you would be right to question it. Despite <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Trends-Reports/Dining-trends-Fewer-than-one-in-10-pub-visits-now-solely-drink-occasions\">the headlines that greeted this latest research</a> from market analysts NPD, its central thrust – that British pubs are now primarily places to eat rather than drink – is not quite<em> </em>as dramatic as it first appears. NPD reported that 92 out of every 100 pub visits now involve the consumption of food. But when I asked NPD to clarify this, it transpires that it counts crisps and nuts. “If the panellist considers a pint and crisps as their dinner, they can declare them as such,” said a spokesperson.</p> \n<p>That is a less resounding death knell for the quick pint than was <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/358129/pub-food-on-the-up-as-operators-diversify\">reported at the time</a>, but it does not soften NPD’s wider message. For those who bemoan the march of the gastropub and the way that many pubs now marginalise drinkers, this report makes grim reading. There are now 100m breakfasts sold in pubs annually, up 128% since 2008. The number of servings of alcohol in pubs has dropped by more than a quarter over the same period, while consumption of tea and coffee has risen by more than 11%. It appears to confirm what analysts and the huge pub companies have been saying for years: that the pint and the traditional boozer is in decline and, to survive, your local must become a family-friendly, food-led pub.</p> \n<p>You can see that happening all around you. Twenty-nine pubs shut each week, and those that survive are, increasingly, places to dine not drink. They are effectively restaurants in former pub spaces. I have nothing against that per se. However, no one could argue that the character of a pub is not hugely altered (that something special is lost, even), in that shift of focus from booze to food. Moreover, while this broad generational change is irrefutable, the propaganda around food-led pubs as the only viable business model has shut out discussion of potential alternatives. There are, although you might not know it, purist drinking dens bucking this rush to food.</p> \n<p>The last few years has seen a surge in pubs where you might get a bowl of wasabi peas (the most illogical pub snack ever) or, at most, a cheese barm, but whose offer is very much based around fantastic drinks, not food. The craft beer movement has been a game-changer in that respect, with – to name but a few – Manchester’s Port Street Beer House, Cask Tavern and Smithfield Tavern; Conwy’s Albion; the Black Dove in Brighton; the Wellington and Craven Arms in Birmingham; or the York, Euston and Harrogate Taps all thriving while doing at most the bare minimum of food. </p> \n<p>In some ways, the fast-growing <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/09/community-fixers-mighty-rise-micropub\">micropub movement</a> (small, no-frills pubs) is an implicit kick-back against the rise of shiny, barnlike family food pubs. In Manchester, there has been a remarkable recent growth in suburban bars that exclusively specialise in great beer. Many of these – Heaton Hops in Stockport, <a href=\"http://prairie-schooner-taphouse.co.uk/\">the Prairie Schooner in Urmston</a>, BarBeerian in Whitefield – double-up as bottle shops, too, a formula replicated at, for instance, Cardiff’s Gravity Station or Tall Boys in Leeds. The message? Stock high-quality, unusual drinks and that, in itself, can turn a pub into a destination. </p> \n<p>That specialism and sense of occasion is something cocktail bars have exploited for years, without feeling the need to serve food. At the same time, a new wave of informal London wine bars, such as Vindinista and <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/bars-pubs/sager-wilde\">Sager + Wilde</a>, while serving food, don’t trouble themselves much beyond short menus comprising small plates, sandwiches, cheeses and charcuterie. Fundamentally, these are places to drink exciting wine. The food is almost incidental.</p> \n<p>I love restaurants, but they have a completely different dynamic to pubs and bars. Pubs are democratic, communal, potentially raucous adult spaces in a way that restaurants (almost) never are. And that is something precious. Let us raise a glass, therefore, to those landlords fighting the good fight for the pure appreciation of fine alcohol, the ennobling effects of a boozy atmosphere and a world where you can walk into a pub and not find all the tables reserved for dinner.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435080905098/756df9f1-89f9-4e6c-b445-a34051ffeb78-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Oli Scarff/Getty Images","altText":"Food for thought ... can pubs get by without going gastro?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T10:41:15Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T10:44:46Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":690,"contributors":[{"name":"Tony Naylor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tonynaylor"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Pubs","Food & drink","Restaurants","Life and style","Alcohol","Society","Beer","Wine"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/pubs","webTitle":"Pubs"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/restaurants","webTitle":"Restaurants"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/alcohol","webTitle":"Alcohol"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/beer","webTitle":"Beer"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tony Naylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/tonynaylor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/must-pubs-serve-food-to-survive","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3mq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/must-pubs-serve-food-to-survive","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/must-pubs-serve-food-to-survive"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435080905098/756df9f1-89f9-4e6c-b445-a34051ffeb78-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Food for thought ... can pubs get by without going gastro?

In his case, it’s not a matter of national security. Though the bioengineer works at a site best known as the birthplace of the atomic bomb, he is spending much of this summer analyzing something less hazardous – a special hybrid beer. </p> \n<p>The fermented beverage under his microscope might have probiotic and other health benefits not normally associated with one of the world’s oldest intoxicants.</p> \n<p>“I can talk in lay terms about what I’m doing, but not the nitty-gritty involving volumes and temperatures and time,” Fox warns me from his office in the New Mexico consortium biological laboratory. </p> \n<p>His silence is sealed by a nondisclosure agreement with the drink’s developer. This isn’t an industry titan like Heineken or Anheuser-Busch, but a 29-year-old home brewer living in rural northern New Mexico.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2aa281c94d35e48953a6be18af6829d30b12fcd7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435591404270/35d7f438-9079-4a0b-a6f5-fbe21c8a7f44-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kombucha maker Ayla Bystrom-Williams, right, with business associate Rena Glasscock and scientist David Fox.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kombucha maker Ayla Bystrom-Williams, right, with business associate Rena Glasscock and scientist David Fox.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Minesh Bacrania</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ayla Bystrom-Williams has spent much of the past several years experimenting with kombucha, an ancient fermented tea that has surged in popularity over the past decade among the health-conscious. The tart-flavored drink relies on a symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast (Scoby) that can survive in an alcoholic solution. This means its probiotic benefits are maintained after fermentation, whereas when exclusively yeast-based drinks like beer are brewed, the culture usually dies. </p> \n<p>Under the auspices of her fledgling micro-business, <a href=\"http://www.honeymoonbrewery.com/\">HoneyMoon Brewing</a>, Bystrom-Williams has recently crafted a crossover beverage that combines the hardiness and health properties of the kombucha Scoby with the flavor profile and raised alcohol content more typical of beer.</p> \n<p>Other brewers have experimented with the same idea, including established brands like Beyond Kombucha and Unity Vibration. Last September, Craft Beer &amp; Brewing magazine predicted that kombucha-beer hybrids <a href=\"http://beerandbrewing.com/VJnD0CsAAE8933PP/article/craft-beer-kombucha-hybrids\">would become a new trend</a>. That trend has yet to fully emerge, however, and Bystrom-Williams’s product remains unusual for catching the attention of one of the largest research institutions in the world. This spring Los Alamos pledged $25,000 in technical assistance to her business. </p> \n<p>The funds come from an <a href=\"http://www.nmsbaprogram.org/\">initiative</a> that allows New Mexico entrepreneurs to benefit from the lab’s sophisticated equipment if they can attract interest from a participating scientist like Fox. “We definitely feel validated to have [Los Alamos] involved in a very precise microbiological role,” Bystrom-Williams said. </p> \n<p>The collaboration is significant given the contentious debate over the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2002/nov/30/shopping1\">health benefits of kombucha</a>. Western medicine has generally approached the 2,000-year-old “immortal health elixir” (as it was called in ancient China) with skepticism. Bystrom-Williams hopes Fox’s research will help verify the potential health benefits of her product.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60930c26e8f1557dbb31bc46a0f8684dc2f25115\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435591491540/20550823-ffdb-40be-b07e-c7fb57b961f8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"David Fox at Los Alamos national laboratory\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Suds up: Fox said he cannot reveal the full details of his research.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Minesh Bacrania</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Fox said he was not familiar enough with existing scientific research to confirm any of the specific claims made about kombucha, but that there is “anecdotal evidence to say a kombucha process or kombucha tea have beneficial properties. From a probiotic standpoint, the microbes have been shown to be good for your intestinal flora. I’ve never heard anyone have some deleterious effect from drinking a kombucha tea due to introduction of a nefarious organism. You’re not sucking down E coli or salmonella.” He also expects the drink to be rich in B vitamins, adding: “There are other antioxidants it sounds like are produced in the process that would prove if not beneficial, at least neutral.”</p> \n<p>Halfway between Santa Fe and the old mining town of Madrid, the remote plot of land where Bystrom-Williams lives and works is baked a burnt umber by summer’s drought, except where stands of chamisa bloom yellow. Bystrom-Williams is in tune with the high desert environment: during the day, she works for what she terms a “feminist landscaping company”. </p> \n<p>At nights and weekends, Bystrom-Williams brews in a rudimentary studio that brings to mind Los Alamos circa the 1940s-era Manhattan Project, when the lab was hardly more than a series of secluded adobe shacks (albeit harboring electrostatic generators and enriched uranium). There, Bystrom-Williams is working toward two primary goals: finalizing a crossover yeast culture entirely unique to her company, and fine-tuning an equally specialized process for its fermentation. “We are pursuing patents for both,” she attested to her progress so far.<br /></p> \n<p>Her patent attorney has advised her not to reveal any trade secrets, but Bystrom-Williams willingly divulged that she is influenced by the fermentation process for Belgian lambics. “They just put these copper trays outside the brewery and let dirt and bugs and everything get into them. They have identified what yeasts are in the air, so they give them exactly the kind of nutrient solution they want.”</p> \n<p>This open-air technique caters to wild yeasts indigenous to a location, so the result is highly regional. Toward a similar end, Bystrom-Williams is working to take advantage of other semi-local resources. Some exist in stark contrast to the high-tech world of Los Alamos, like a self-sufficient <a href=\"http://christdesert.org/\">monastery in the desert</a> where Benedictine monks grow a native strain of hops (neomexicanus) for their own brewing purposes that she hopes to acquire.</p> \n<p>Her main priority remains crafting a probiotic drink as high in flavor (and alcohol content) as it is low in indulgence-triggered guilt. Reconciling the positive and negative impacts of alcohol is a pursuit as old as drinking itself. In many ancient cultures, alcoholic fermentation was first developed as <a href=\"http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/Issues/1996/December/pintaday.asp\">an antiseptic and preservation technique</a>. More recently, modern researchers have linked the moderate consumption of wine with decreased rates of cardiovascular disease and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2013/sep/01/wine-benefits-mental-health-spanish-study\">depression</a>.</p> \n<p>“Give me the summer and come back to me,” Fox responded to whether a glass of kombucha beer a day might keep the doctor away. Though bound by silence elsewhere, he finds the large-scale potential of the project exciting to discuss. “The beautiful thing about being a scientist is sometimes opportunities come along that pique your interest enough that you have to run with them, even if they’re a bit counter to the mainstream. You can’t let that influence what could potentially be a pretty amazing bit of science in its end product.”<br /></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435591339746/9c1774be-3a3d-4d9a-b83c-c53245b666e4-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Minesh Bacrania","altText":"Kombucha in a jar","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Minesh Bacrania"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435591404999/480c21f7-8fd2-497b-8006-403515c799d5-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kombucha maker Ayla Bystrom-Williams, right, with business associate Rena Glasscock and scientist David Fox.

I understood that it was supposed to be sharper, more incisive, more seafood-ready than other styles of chardonnay. But too often that was taken to extremes. They were tart, wincingly so, rather than refreshing, and the flavour was restrained to the point of minimalism. I changed my mind after realizing that 1, I wasn’t drinking the right bottles, and 2, chablis is as much about the feeling as the taste. It’s not that they lack in flavour, it’s just that the flavour (green apple, lemon, cr&egrave;me fraiche, minerals) is carried by (and seems to reflect off) the swish of glinting, steely acidity. Which is exactly what happens in this delightful pure, unoaked example from Samuel Billaud.</p> \n<p><strong> </strong></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.tesco.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Tesco</strong></a><strong> Finest Premier Cru Chablis , France 2011 (&pound;13.99)</strong> Like most people, I came to chablis via the supermarkets. And while I know there are plenty of wine lovers who will say that I shouldn’t have been surprised that the earth failed to move – that the supermarkets are incapable of doing really interesting wine – these days chablis is in fact something that many of the bigger retailers do quite well. Two producers are behind most of the best supermarket chablis. The refined premier cru wines of Jean-Marc Brocard are worth seeking out at Asda and M&amp;S, while the well-run local co-operative does an excellent job with the straight Chablis at Morrisons, M&amp;S and Tesco, the cheaper (&pound;9) Petit-Chablis at Sainsbury’s, and, the pick of the bunch, the racy but tangy and slightly nutty Tesco Premier Cru.</p> \n<p><strong>Isabelle et Denis Pommier Chablis 1er Cru Fourchaume 2012 (&pound;33.50, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bbr.com/?gclid=CP-s8v-QqMYCFYvHtAod5kEB-g\" title=\"\"><strong>Berry Bros &amp; Rudd</strong></a><strong>) </strong>As with the rest of Burgundy (Chablis is out on a limb at the northerly reaches of the great eastern French wine region), the very best wines in Chablis are made by small producers working in the best premier cru- or grand cru-rated vineyards. Also like the rest of Burgundy, the quicksilver beauty of the top wines from cult producers such as Dauvissat and Raveneau tend to start north or &pound;100 a bottle. There is magic in the premier cru wines of the superb 2012 chablis vintage at slightly more human prices, however, not least in the Pommiers’ exquisite wine from the Fourchaume vineyard, which has a rippling richness of stone fruit to go with the electric acidity and minerals.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435142798202/chablis-wine-growing-in-t-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Not too shabby: sunset over the vineyards of Chablis.

Some growers are harvesting five or six weeks earlier than they used to, even at the end of August.”</p> \n<p>The rise in temperatures in the country has been roughly twice the global average change since the late 1800s, leading to summer heatwaves and winters milder by almost 2C, according to Sweden’s <a href=\"http://www.smhi.se/en/research/research-departments/climate-research-rossby-centre2-552\">Rossby Centre</a> for climate research. The change is helping to turn Nordic viniculture from a retirement hobby into a small but resilient commercial reality – there are more than a dozen vineyards selling to the country’s alcohol stores, while many more have created businesses around their wine. </p> \n<p>Few Swedes themselves have even heard of Swedish wine and, for those who have, it has been something of a joke – a poor imitation of the New World and Mediterranean wines that have transformed the country’s drinking tastes. But a Michelin-starred restaurant in Gothenburg has just started to take Hansson’s wine, and he has ambitious expansion plans. What started as a mid-life crisis after a career in finance has become a dream of placing Sweden on the map as a wine-producing nation.</p> \n<p>“Sweden is like England 15 years ago,” says Hansson’s sommelier, Karl Sj&ouml;strom, 32, who is inspired by the story of how Kent and Sussex vineyards learned to make fine sparkling wines. “We have the potential to develop the reputation that English wine has built.”</p> \n<p>But the obstacles are formidable. As a wine region, the county of Sk&aring;ne in southern Sweden, where most of the vineyards are based, is barely two decades old and still has much to learn, says Jannie Vestergaard of the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools-databases/regional-innovation-monitor/organisation/sydsverige/sk%C3%A5ne-food-innovation-network\">Sk&aring;ne Food Innovation Network</a>.</p> \n<p>“People came into wine with passion, but not with knowledge, so in the early years lots of mistakes were made – middle-aged men who had tasted good French wines wanting the same to happen in their backyard,” Vestergaard says. </p> \n<p>Many growers are pulling up their red-grape vines, she says, after concluding that the soil and climate aren’t suitable. Swedish vineyards are still searching for a grape variety that perfectly suits the specific Nordic <em>terroir</em>, where the short growing season produces fruit with high acidity. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/sweden_vineyards/giv-21277xK50f5Beu7se/\" data-alt=\"Swedish wine country\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/sweden_vineyards/giv-21277xK50f5Beu7se/\">Swedish wine country</a> \n</figure> \n<p>While the past two summers have been scorching hot, May and June this year have been the coldest since 1962. “The northern latitude makes it possible that even with climate change the average temperatures will be low, with the risk of frost in the autumn,” says J&ouml;rgen Bogren of the department of earth sciences at Gothenburg University. “So it is very uncertain to be making investments in the wine industry in Sweden, which is likely to remain marginal.”</p> \n<p>Sweden’s strict alcohol laws mean vineyards are not allowed to sell bottles of their wine on site, but instead have to supply the national alcohol retail monopoly, or <a href=\"http://www.concealedwines.com/business-opportunities-scandinavia-wine-producers/systembolaget-one-of-the-worlds-greatest-retailers/\">Systembolaget</a>. This means visitors to a vineyard who have tasted the wine in the depths of the Swedish countryside can’t take a bottle home with them, depriving growers of valuable income.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"df534b06629d844e2b1c2381bb483b2fcbb24fa1\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/df534b06629d844e2b1c2381bb483b2fcbb24fa1/0_0_3646_5472/666.jpg\" alt=\"Sommelier Karl Sj&ouml;strom, left, and owner H&aring;kan Hansson in the wine cellar at H&auml;ll&aring;kra vineyard.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sommelier Karl Sj&ouml;strom, left, and owner H&aring;kan Hansson in the wine cellar at H&auml;ll&aring;kra vineyard.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Crouch</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Swedish winegrowers are like a small ant delivering a grain of sand to enormous alcohol supermarkets, so the transaction costs are high,” says Paulina Rytk&ouml;nen, a researcher at S&ouml;dert&ouml;rn University outside Stockholm. Small volumes, low yields and high costs mean that Swedish wines retail at three times the price of French or Italian.</p> \n<p>The country has a strong and institutionalised temperance movement, Rytk&ouml;nen says, making politicians wary of loosening the rules governing alcohol sales. A parliamentary inquiry five years ago concluded that the rules could be relaxed to allow wine sales at vineyards without threatening the overall monopoly, but it was quietly shelved. </p> \n<p>But Murat Sofrakis, whose <a href=\"http://vingardeniklagshamn.se/\">Klagshamn vineyard</a> lies within sight of the famous bridge linking Sweden to Denmark, is undeterred. The cold spring has meant he has had to thin 30,000 grape clusters from his vines, which usually flower in time for Wimbledon, but are three weeks behind. </p> \n<p>“I like to compare Sweden to <a href=\"http://www.centralotagonz.com/\">Central Otago</a> on South Island in New Zealand – the world’s most southerly wine region,” he says. “It now has some of the best pinot noirs, but for years they said it was impossible because it was too cold.”</p> \n<p>Sofrakis turned to wine in 2001 after running a pet shop in Malm&ouml; – he and his partner, Lena J&ouml;rgensen, both 47, took over a small farm, replacing cabbages with vines. They visit scores of vineyards in Europe every year in their quest to improve the quality of their wines. Swedish wine writer <a href=\"http://www.alftumble.com/\">Alf Tumble</a> named Klagshamn’s Terra Scania 2014 as one of his top 10 wines in May, with a “roundness and sweetness in flavour balancing the crisp acid”.</p> \n<p>Solfrakis embraces the acidity of his grapes. “Fruit has more flavour grown in a cold climate because of the acidity,” he says. “When you taste the wine here, you realise what you have lost.”</p> \n<p>At 1.5 hectares, Klagshamn is small, Sofrakis admits, but the average size of vineyards in the German wine region of Mosel is only two hectares. The English experience shows it takes 25 years to learn to produce good wine, he says, but once a vineyard succeeds, suddenly the wine world takes an interest.</p> \n<p>Swedish winegrowers have found innovative ways to make up for the trade they lose to the retail monopoly. One vineyard in <a href=\"http://www.visitahus.com/\">&Aring;hus</a> allows people to sponsor a row of vines and to spend time tending it; there are also bicycle tours of local vineyards that end in tastings. Others encourage culinary tourism by opening restaurants at their vineyards. </p> \n<p>Staffan Lake, chair of Sweden’s winegrowers’ association, is focused on supplying restaurants in Stockholm, based on establishing an emotional relationship with the wine. “We are selling a story and an experience, showing that our cold climate can produce wonderful wine,” he says. “This is a craft, locally made by hand. This is why people will pay higher prices.”</p> \n<p>At H&auml;ll&aring;kra vineyard, Hansson is confident about the future, so much so that he is persisting with an aromatic, fruity red and planning to nearly double his vines by 2018.</p> \n<p>“Winegrowers from hot southern countries say they would die to have the acidity of Swedish grapes, it’s what makes our wine distinctive,” he says. “We knew the problems when we started – we just have to prove we can produce top-quality wines.”</p> \n<p>Wine critic Tumble remains sceptical. “Swedish wine production may have a future if the climate continues to gets warmer,” he says. Balance is a problem thanks to high acidity and lack of fruit, while many growers are enthusiasts rather than professionals. “We’ll just have to wait and see – and taste along the way.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> The standfirst of this article was amended on 27 June 2015 to state “Milder winters” rather than summers<br /></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435331178473/3f1d3984-6a2b-47ff-abcd-00fa7dfc6a76-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David Crouch","altText":"Murat Sofrakis and Lena Jörgensen in the Klagshamn vineyard.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Crouch"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c33d7e55965f7ad8f82f1c7fdb0f41c13ca5ff4f/0_153_1391_835/1391.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":835,"width":1391,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A south-facing filed of vines at Hällåkra vineyard in southern Sweden.
