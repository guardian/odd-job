Drinking early in the day doesn’t usually come with such official approbation. We tend to think of morning drinks in extremes – a bloody mary or swift half to provide a much-needed quick fix after a long night, or perhaps bubbles for special occasion breakfasts. However, in many parts of the world, booze at breakfast is seen as a perfectly normal way to start the day. </p> \n<p>The weisswurst fr&uuml;hst&uuml;ck Obama was enjoying is a beery Bavarian stalwart: boiled sausages with mustard, freshly baked pretzels and a cold weissbier, the operative word here being cold. Alcohol in the morning must be fresh and zippy. A bit of fizz, something dry, a hint of sweetness, a sharp kick – as drinks writer <a href=\"https://worldofbooze.wordpress.com/\">Henry Jeffreys</a> puts it, “it’s the pick-me-up that makes you mellow”. Beer or ale for breakfast is not uncommon in the rest of northern Europe, particularly in Belgium – and even, until as late as the 1980s, in England, where breweries would give free drinks to their workers. While this was probably to counter pilfering, it also continued a long tradition of brewers enjoying a hearty brew to start the day, harking back to the “liquid bread” of 16th-century friars. It would seem there is more to an early-morning pint than just hair of the dog.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/may/02/how-to-make-perfect-bloody-mary\">How to make the perfect bloody mary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Around the Mediterranean, you’ll often see older patrons having a <em>caff&egrave; corretto</em>, the espresso quite literally “corrected” with a shot of something stronger: grappa, sambuca or brandy. It is a habit Mitch Tonks and Mat Prowse adopted at a fish market in Spain 15 years ago; they call it their morning fire. The grappa is sometimes substituted with armagnac, Fernet-Branca or whatever other local spirit the two chefs encounter on their travels. “It takes the body by surprise,” writes Tonks in his new cookbook, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/296071/\">The Seahorse</a>. “We have found that in this moment of lightness and clarity we have made our best decisions.” Which makes <a href=\"http://www.seahorserestaurant.co.uk/\">the Seahorse restaurant</a> staff living proof that drinking in the day might not actually render working minds as useless as you’d think. It’s all about being restrained: “The trick is to have just one glass,” says Tonks, “otherwise the surprise is spoiled.”</p> \n<p>London wine bar Vinoteca has just opened <a href=\"http://www.vinoteca.co.uk/kingscross/\">a Kings Cross branch</a>, the first to serve breakfast. “You don’t have to not drink wine early in the day,” counsels co-owner Brett Woonton. Woonton and his partner, Charlie Young, focused on bottles that would work best with breakfast, plumping for lightness and freshness over full-bodied heft; drinks that would be accessible and approachable. So they have got a pink moscato, the sweet, fruity fizz of which sits handsomely with a plate of pancakes; a slightly frizzante, dry red bonarda that cuts judiciously through the richness of a meaty breakfast; and a German riesling to pair with fresh fruit or muesli.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef460f8300fa256902c808d156f0c0a9ff52dbdb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433841844221/1ca0baaa-cd7b-47fa-9815-e6370aab6346-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Vinoteca in Kings Cross, London, advertises its breakfast wines\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vinoteca in King’s Cross, London, advertises its breakfast wines.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For Woonton, a good breakfast wine should be the oenological equivalent of an early-morning swim: invigorating and enlivening.

Food writer <a href=\"https://racheleats.wordpress.com/\">Rachel Roddy</a>, the author of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/290678/\">Five Quarters</a>, says her partner’s grandfather, a Sicilian farmer, “drank a litre of white with his breakfast of bread and caponata every single morning at six”. That would be followed by a whole lemon, eaten like an apple, before he left the house. “He also drank a litre for lunch,” she continues “and never drank water. He was tiny, without fat, as strong as a horse and he lived until 95.”</p> \n<p>The thought of all that wine, particularly without water, is a terrifying prospect, but there may well be something in it in moderation.

The UK wine trade’s version – the London Wine Fair – took place at Olympia at the end of May. And after years during which it had taken a depressingly corporate turn with very few interesting wines to taste, I have surprised myself in the past couple of years by coming away with a notebook bulging with new discoveries. This superb Tuscan red is one: a blend of two vintages from a noted producer of Brunello di Montalcino, it has all the deep cherry, herbs and savoury power of the best sangiovese from the area at an unusually good price.</p> \n<p><strong>Weingut Claus Schneider Sp&auml;tburgunder Weiler Schlipf CS, Baden, Germany 2012 (&pound;19.95, </strong><a href=\"http://www.swig.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>Swig</strong></a><strong>) </strong>The most notable change at the London Wine Fair is the way it has finally caught up with the wine trade itself. Though it is still filled with purveyors of big brands and bulk wine brokers, the organisers have made a concerted effort to woo the more interesting small-scale suppliers – the kind of people that do brisk business with the burgeoning scene of small independent wine merchants, wine bars and restaurants rather than the supermarkets. Swig, a supplier that doubles up as one of the UK’s most imaginative online retailers, is one example, and among its array of exciting emerging producers –Edoardo Miroglio in Bulgaria, Blank Bottle in South Africa, BK Wines in Australia – I was most taken with this delicate, silky and pure German pinot noir.</p> \n<p><strong>Domaine Jean-Maurice Raffault, Chinon Blanc, Loire, France 2014 (&pound;13.50, </strong><a href=\"http://www.yapp.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>Yapp Bros</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Another small supplier-cum-retailer at the fair was Yapp Bros, the family-run Wiltshire merchant that has been going since the 1970s. An early champion of what used to be called, somewhat patronisingly, “regional France”, Yapp is still arguably the best places in the UK to buy wines from the Loire, the Rh&ocirc;ne and across the south. It had several fine examples on show: from classics such as Le Vieux Donjon’s top-flight Ch&acirc;teauneuf-du-Pape or Domaine Filiatreau’s delectable Loire cabernet franc; to curiosities such as this delightful spring fresh but super-tangy Loire chenin, a rare but delicious example of a white wine from the red wine territory of Chinon.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433325921473/International-Wine-Challe-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A glass apart: tasting at the The London Wine Fair.

Through the food of Japan, the west discovered a new frontier of taste: light and healthy, respect for texture and flavour, refined presentation. Little wonder, then, that today some of the most accomplished and multi-talented chefs are Japanese.</p> \n<p>What tends to get overlooked in any discussion of Japanese cuisine, however, are its two basic elements: rice and sake. For Japanese palates, each is essential to the success of a meal. Sake has a strong reputation and even a certain prestige abroad. But rice? Isn’t it just, well, rice?</p> \n<p>Not for the Japanese. The only rice people eat there is made in Japan, for two reasons. Foreign producers are locked out of the market by prohibitive taxes – taxes that protect domestic producers allied with the country’s conservative base. And domestic rice has a specific taste; the best, as far as the Japanese are concerned, is koshihikari rice, a shiny, short-grained variety. Once only grown in the coastal Niigata prefecture of Honshu, it’s now cultivated on other islands and has even been copied by the Chinese.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If “rice is the metaphor of Japanese identity, sake is its accomplishment”</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>For centuries, rice has shaped the Japanese landscape and symbolised nature’s bounty and farmers’ hard work. In the eighth century, in the Man’yoshu poetry anthology, the plant was lauded for its “radiant ears”. For years, eating white rice was a privilege of the rich; the lower classes mixed it with “poor” grains like millet and barley. To the Japanese, rice isn’t just an accompaniment to a meal; it’s its central element, so much so that, cooked, it is synonymous with the meal itself. In Japanese, <em>gohan</em> means both a bowl of rice and the entire meal.</p> \n<p>Sake, for its part, is considered uniquely Japanese, just like the rice it’s made from. But Japan’s signature beverage is a bit misunderstood abroad. In Japanese, sake is a generic term for all alcoholic beverages. The rice wine we call sake actually has a different name in Japan: <em>nihonshu</em>.</p> \n<p>These days, however, rice and sake, those two quintessential emblems of Japan, have hit a rough patch on native soil. Under globalisation, homegrown tastes have to compete either with standardised ones or ones that try to mimic the real thing. The agricultural lobby, too, has seen its power dwindle, and international free-trade deals under negotiation could make things worse. Rice and sake also fell victim to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/fukushima\" title=\"\">the nuclear catastrophe of Fukushima in March 2011</a>; the region was a big producer of both. And although the rice fields there have now been largely decontaminated of radioactive fallout, producers of sake continue to suffer; the purity of the water needed to make it has been compromised.</p> \n<p>Slowly but surely, rice and sake are losing ground in Japan. Bread consumption has risen to compete with rice, while beer and wine are outpacing sake. Only by concentrating on the singularity of its terroir can sake – and by extension the best varieties of rice – salvage its future, believes French geographer Nicolas Baumert, author of <a href=\"http://www.reseau-asie.com/article-en/months-articles-archive/reseau-asie-s-editorial/sake-japanese-exception-nicolas-baumert/\" title=\"\">Sake: A Japanese Exception</a>. Japan has a plethora of cookbooks and wine guides that tend to be as elitist as the advertising that shapes the trends that consumers follow, but today it’s still old-fashioned word-of-mouth that makes or breaks a product’s reputation, especially among amateurs of sake.</p> \n<p>If “rice is the metaphor of Japanese identity, sake is its accomplishment” writes Baumert, an associate professor at Nagoya University. But while sake is without question “the most accomplished” of all rice wines, the Japanese didn’t invent it, he points out; it exists elsewhere in Asia, notably in China and South Korea. Still, so successfully has Japan appropriated the drink, it’s now considered an authentic Japanese product. “Other rice wines seem mere distant cousins,” the author notes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"19aedc2b3964fc18b64aa3dbc7eb826222727f6f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433429189175/0b8e1984-af94-4c59-974e-49909938ab66-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"rice and sake on a table\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sake and rice production was damaged by the 2011 Fukushima disaster.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bruno Ehrs/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Sake is anchored in the collective imagination of the Japanese.

A blend of rice and water, sake was made through fermentation and so was a metaphor for life; it also had a major religious role, especially in Shinto, Japan’s indigenous faith. According to historian Hidetoshi Miyachi, sake was long a drink of the aristocracy before military conscription during the Meiji period (1868-1912) transformed it into a popular beverage nationwide. Western dining habits, which allow wine to be drunk at table, changed consumption patterns yet again; sake started to be served in Japan with meals.</p> \n<p>Rice and sake have been at the heart of Japanese cooking and winemaking for centuries. And the importance they held at feasts is no more evident than in The Merits of Sake and Rice Compared, a scroll painted at the end of the 15th or start of the 16th century that was widely reproduced up until the 19th. A copy made in the 17th century and preserved at the Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale de France is the subject of a <a href=\"http://www.editionsdianedeselliers.com/book-des-merites-compares-du-sake-et-du-riz-illustrated-by-a-japanese-scroll\" title=\"\">wonderful new book published</a> by &Eacute;ditions Diane de Selliers.</p> \n<p>Rich in illustrations and intellectually rigorous in its commentary, the scroll is a parody of disputation, a literary genre of medieval Japan that employed controversy to impart an edifying message.</p> \n<p>There are three protagonists in the story: a nobleman who’s an amateur of sake, a monk who craves rice, and a warrior who favours moderation in all things. The three men debate the fundamental question: “Should one get drunk or stay sober?”</p> \n<p>The amusing discussion echoes the verbal wit of Rabelais, notes Claire-Akiko Brisset, a Japan expert who supervised the translation of this “poetic work on the art of cooking”, as co-editors Estelle Leggeri-Bauer and V&eacute;ronique B&eacute;ranger call it. Diving deep into the sources of Japanese culinary art, the scroll has “an exceptional documentary value”, says their colleague, ethnologist Jane Cobbi.</p> \n<p>It provides the keys to understand dining habits and cooking techniques that are still with us today: the cutting up of fish and fowl, the preparation and presentation of meals, and detailed descriptions of utensils such as mortars, wooden pestles and sieves. “What this beautiful document allows us to see is how a formal meal was arranged according to clearly defined norms,” writes Cobbi. It also signals “the appearance of an ‘art of good living’ that began with products chosen according to season and place”, she says. Whereas before the 15th century the culinary arts seem to have been only a secondary theme in Japanese literature and iconography, the scroll marks “the birth of gastronomie” in the archipelago.</p> \n<p>It also illustrates the pros and cons of drinking. Japan was always a tolerant place for drunks. The tipsy wage-earner taking the last train home is a recurring image in modern Japan. Even several centuries ago, drunkenness was not seen in a bad light – on the contrary. “Ghosts and light drinkers don’t exist,” went the adage. “A banquet was considered a success when the guests started losing all control ... and even those who didn’t like to drink pretended they were drunk in order to please their host,” historian Isao Kumakura writes in an afterword to the book.</p> \n<p>Proper drinking also had its rituals, such as the passing around of goblets as a seal of friendship. In those days, there was little drinking during meals, Kumakura notes. But after the meal was over, it was a veritable free-for-all of binge-drinking, buffoonery and bad behaviour.</p> \n<p><em>This article appeared in </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/weekly\" title=\"\">Guardian Weekly</a><em>, which incorporates material from Le Monde</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432209174147/Sake-bottles-in-a-sake-br-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sake bottles in a sake brewery, Takayama, Gifu Prefecture, Japan.

So how does this affect the wines you buy?</p> \n<p>Asda and Morrisons currently appear to have more of a “we try harder” attitude, making sure they have plenty to offer in their basic lines but also seeking to demonstrate that they have a much broader range than the German-owned parvenus.</p> \n<p>Asda, for instance, has introduced a new Wine Atlas range, targeted at younger, more adventurous drinkers, which ticks all the boxes: great value, appealingly colourful labels, intriguing off-the-beaten-track drinking. Two of the best are the <strong>Wine Atlas Cigales Tempranillo 2011</strong> (&pound;5.97; 14% abv), a deliciously vibrant, youthful, Rioja-style red from north-west Spain, and the even more sharply priced <a href=\"http://groceries.asda.com/asda-webstore/landing/home.shtml?cmpid=ahc-_-ghs-sna1-_-asdacom-dsk-_-hp%C2%A3/product/910001813567#/product/910001813567\"><strong>Grillo 2014</strong></a> (&pound;4.97; 12.5% abv), an attractively smooth white from Sicilian cooperative Cantine Settesoli which tastes a bit like an unoaked chardonnay (though don’t let that put you off, chardonnay-phobes). They’re available in only around 260 stores, though.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"55b773730d9ba23c8392e35afb3054467d341d71\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432644746407/a6d13c18-ae79-4531-88f3-2e8fa42ddbf8-111x420.jpeg\" alt=\"WIne: Villa Maria\" width=\"111\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Morrisons hasn’t come up with anything quite as clever but still has a much wider selection of wines than either Aldi or Lidl, ranging from its upmarket Signature range (try the crisp <a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/M-Signature-Verdicchio/243049011\">Verdicchio</a>, at just &pound;5.49; 12.5% abv) to more esoteric listings such as Villa Maria’s fragrant<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/product/Villa-Maria-Private-Bin-Arneis/266545011\"><strong>Private Bin Arneis</strong></a><strong> 2013</strong> (&pound;9.99 online from morrisons.com; 13% abv), from New Zealand, which bears favourable comparison to those from the grape’s original home of Piedmont.</p> \n<p>Morrisons has also done a good job of picking up on trends such as the current malbec craze, stocking not only wines from Argentina but malbecs from the south of France, Australia and South Africa. I’d personally go for one of the Argentinians, the <a href=\"https://groceries.morrisons.com/webshop/getSearchProducts.do?clearTabs=yes&amp;isFreshSearch=true&amp;entry=alzar+malbec\"><strong>Alzar Malbec</strong></a><strong> 2014 </strong>(&pound;7.49; 13% abv), which is not as high in alcohol as some but still has plenty of grunt, as the Aussies nicely put it.</p> \n<p>Sainsbury’s, meanwhile, is sticking to the knitting – concentrating on the classic wines it tends to do well. As one of the buyers admitted to me the other day, “We don’t want to lose customers by changing things too much.” With the odd exception, their Taste the Difference range is pretty hard to fault on quality or price – witness the 2014 <a href=\"http://www.sainsburys.co.uk/shop/gb/groceries/white-wine/sainsburys-sancerre--taste-the-difference-75cl\"><strong>Taste the Difference Sancerre</strong></a> (&pound;13; 12.5% abv) which is as good a supermarket Sancerre as I’ve tasted: elegant and precise, with lovely delicate, summery gooseberry fruit.

And it’s not just the type of ice that’s important, but the way it’s cut. </p> \n<p>Among specialty cocktail makers, there is a growing acceptance that the type of ice is as crucial as the base spirit.

Several smaller cubes of ice float in a well-made old-fashioned.</p> \n<p>Jerry Thomas, the first barman to publish a book on mixing, recognised the importance of ice. Working in bars in California and New York in the late 19th century, Thomas published The Bartender’s Guide, also know as How to Mix Drinks or A Bon Vivant’s Companion.</p> \n<p>According to a 2007 piece in the<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/dining/31cock.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0\"> New York Times</a>, “He [Thomas] laid down the principles for formulating mixed drinks of all categories and established the image of the bartender as a creative professional.”</p> \n<p>Thomas’ rules on ice are <a href=\"http://cocktails.about.com/od/mixology/p/important_ice.htm\">still relevant today</a>. He says: “As a general rule, shaved ice should be used when spirits form the principal ingredient of the drink, and no water is employed. When eggs, mild, wine, vermouth, seltzer or other mineral waters are used ... it is better to use small lumps of ice ... ” </p> \n<p>Geoff Fewell, the head barman of <a href=\"http://www.vuedemonde.com.au/the-lui-bar\">Lui bar at Vue de Monde,</a> met with Guardian Australia (unfortunately over coffee not cocktails) to discuss the importance of ice in making cocktails.</p> \n<p>Lui bar bring their ice in from Tullamarine in Melbourne’s west. </p> \n<p>Says Fewell: “We use <a href=\"http://www.donohoeice.com.au/\">Donohoe Ice</a> in Tullamarine. The purity is incredible. We get 40kg blocks which come in insulated bubble wrap.”</p> \n<p>The product is also popular among ice sculptors. </p> \n<p>“Each day we take a block upstairs and we use many tools, Japanese ice saws and pick as well as meat cleavers for making cubes. We also have three ice picks. Sawing is the hardest part – we have a large ice saw that does require strength,” says Fewell. </p> \n<p>Fewell makes the “classic negroni” at the Lui bar (one part gin, one part vermouth rosso and one part Campari, garnished with orange peel). “It’s a combination of strong, bitter and herbal. Bartenders and chefs love them because of the flavour,” he says.</p> \n<p>I wonder if it’s too early for a negroni. </p> \n<p>“A negroni is a very relaxing drink,” says Fewell. “After a hard day I say, have a beer and a shot, or have a negroni.”</p> \n<p>The shape of ice used by Lui bar for negronis is the sphere. “We use Japanese ice moulds. This speeds up the sphere – which is a round globe of ice. It has the same volume as a cube and it has a less surface area. This minimises dilution of the finished drink.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab2864104f88892281edff0d060ffaf97c14bcaf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433123608785/2adb8ac6-11c6-4eaf-a6ca-f17c98733c75-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Special Japanese mould for negronis ice at the Lui Bar. \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The special Japanese mould for negronis ice at the Lui bar.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Supplied.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The sphere is moulded accordingly so there’s “a perfect dilution”. The shape of ice for each drink is carefully chosen. “In some cocktails, mainly old-fashioneds, we want it to dilute,” says Fewell.</p> \n<p>“All our rocks cocktails (sours, Collins’, jungle birds) have some form of hand-cut ice. Old fashioneds we’ll use several little cubes – you want to dilute it and change the flavour.”</p> \n<p>If a cocktail is juice-based, bartenders will “use the larger cube so that it will melt slower; because of the juice the drink is already diluted”.</p> \n<p>“For negronis and old-fashioneds we’ll use the sphere – though just one – as they are quite large.”</p> \n<p>While the large cube has been “popular in good bars for a little while”, the focus on ice is not a new thing. </p> \n<p>“Back in the 1900s they were using this type of ice because it’s all they had. Ice was originally shipped from the US to bars around the world. Melbourne was one of the first cities to have the imported ice. All ice came from lakes and glaciers before compression refrigeration,” says Fewell.</p> \n<p>The ice with the best reputation that all the bartenders wanted a piece of was from Wenham Lake in Massachusetts – it was reported to be Queen Victoria’s favourite place to source ice.</p> \n<p>After my interview with Geoff Fewell, he went upstairs to prepare for his shift and presumably start sharpening one of his many saws to hack into the massive block of ice that would be delivered that day. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, I headed to the nearest bar – my thirst primed for a negroni with a large block of ice. </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wenham_Lake\"><br /></a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433131986172/5a6177a2-7b41-483d-9e2c-28a85f251ab5-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Supplied.","altText":"The ice at the Lui Bar is bought in large blocks from Tullamarine.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Supplied."}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/6/1412597255758/Two-glasses-of-negroni-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Any time is a good time for negronis.

But for all its popularity in tapas bars, small-plate restaurants and new-wave wine bars, it’s still very niche. Sales are tiny compared to sherry’s 1970s heyday when it was found in every suburban drinks cabinet. As a result, it’s also cheap: it’s hard to think of a table wine to match the salty, nutty finesse offered by Sainsbury’s new Winemakers’ Selection Pale Dry Fino at &pound;5.50, while the amontillado from the same retailer and producer (Lustau) is superbly tangy and savoury.</p> \n<p><strong>Fernando de Castilla Antique Fino Sherry NV (from &pound;16.89, </strong><a href=\"http://rannochscott.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Rannoch Scott</strong></a><strong>; </strong><a href=\"http://www.henningswine.co.uk/index.php\" title=\"\"><strong>Hennings Wine</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Most supermarkets are pretty good at sherry: the M&amp;S, Waitrose, Morrisons and Tesco own-label versions of the popular lighter dry styles, fino and manzanilla, which get their character from ageing under a layer of yeast known as flor, are each among the best-value wines in their respective ranges. And big-name brands such as T&iacute;o Pepe Fino and La Gitana Manzanilla are also reliably good at providing the brisk, salty-umami hit that feels like a savoury snack and refreshing drink combined in a single glass. That’s not to say that spending a few more quid from time to time won’t get you something even more special, however, such as Fernando de Castilla’s long, complex, multi-layered take on fino.</p> \n<p><strong>Gonzalez Byass Leonor Sherry NV (&pound;13.75, </strong><a href=\"http://www.oddbins.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Oddbins</strong></a><strong>) </strong>While winemakers tend to talk up the vineyardsas the most important factor in shaping their product’s character, producers in Jerez are more concerned with what goes on in the cellar. The great sherry blenders combine scientific know-how, logistical precision and a chef’s understanding of flavour in juggling the many thousands of barrels in their bodegas. But there’s mystery and magic, too: will a wine develop the flor yeast become a fino or amontillado? Or will it age without it as an oloroso? Or it could be a very rare palo cortado, where the flor disappears, leading to a halfway-house style such as Leonor’s, where the Marmite-like yeastiness is joined by the smoothness of creamy toffee and nuts.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432720725209/Barrels-outside-a-sherry--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Roll out the barrels: a sherry bodega near Jerez.
