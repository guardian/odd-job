Her father, a cobbler, was considered a “businessman” by the Soviet regime, which was fairly new at the time, and was promptly and unceremoniously executed by the Red Army. The family’s modest house and only cow was confiscated “for the people”.</p> \n<p>My grandmother was an infinitely curious and knowledge-thirsty little girl and was so determined to educate herself that she would plough her way to school in heavy snow every day. The journey took two hours each way, and on one occasion the weather was so severe that she nearly froze to death. She was rescued by a passing man riding his horse-drawn <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britzka\"><em>brichka</em></a>.</p> \n<p>Some years later, to escape from an unfortunate marriage to a broken alcoholic, she picked up her little daughter Valyushka, jumped on a train and headed to Tashkent, in Uzbekistan. I think I have definitely inherited her adventurous gene.</p> \n<p>Vera, a dark-haired, almond-eyed Siberian beauty – met my Ukrainian grandfather Aleksey – a broad-shouldered, charismatic soldier from Vinnitsa, in central Ukraine, on the train to Tashkent. They fell in love there and then and settled in Uzbekistan’s capital, where my father was born a year later.</p> \n<p>Tashkent, 2,000km away from where Vera had grown up, was a desirable destination for Russians from the north. Even during times of bitter hunger and destitution, people tried their luck and shifted to Tashkent to bring some wheat back for their families. It was famous for its abundance and became known as The City of Bread – there was even a book written by Alexander Neverov, and later a film, of the same name.</p> \n<p>In 1958, when my dad was born, Tashkent’s markets were brimming with rice, wheat, mountains of fruit, nuts, chickpeas and lentils. But despite the city’s riches, things didn’t go well for my grandparents in Tashkent and eventually they decided to leave. They moved to Voznesensk in Ukraine, but my <em>babushka</em> brought with her all the incredible recipes she had learned from her Tajik and Uzbek neighbours while she had lived there.</p> \n<p>My grandmother never stopped cooking Siberian <em>pelmeni</em> and delicious Ukrainian <em>vareniki</em> (both dumplings) and curd cheese pancakes. It was she who taught my mother to make <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Be%C5%9Fbarmaq\"><em>beshparmak</em></a> and the Uzbek <em>plov</em> (pilaf) recipe below.</p> \n<p>When she moved from Tashkent she found she had to adapt her recipes to suit Ukrainian ingredients. <em>Beshparmak</em> is a traditional central Asian lamb dish vaguely comparable to lasagna – silky sheets of pasta, poached, pulled meat and onions cooked in <em>kurdiuk</em> (fat-rumped sheep) lamb fat. However, lamb wasn’t available in the south of Ukraine, so the fattest chicken she could find the market went into the pot, and the onions were cooked in chicken fat instead.</p> \n<p>The <em>plov </em>recipe below has gone through several transformations of its own. My grandmother would cook it with Ukraine’s staple meat, pork – which her Uzbek friends would have been horrified by, as most Uzbeks are Muslim. Then my mother started rearing ducks 10 years ago and grew a barberry bush. She started making the <em>plov</em> with duck. Now I am in London, and duck is expensive, so I collect giblets in my freezer when I buy duck, using them only when I have collected enough.</p> \n<p>A traditional <em>plov</em> uses an equal amount of meat, carrots and onions, and I am sticking to this magical formula. <em>Kurdiuk</em> – fat-rumped lamb fat –is traditionally used, but I love duck fat and use that! Feel free to use lamb if you want a more authentic dish, otherwise try my version – I think the sweet, richness of the duck fat and giblets really works well.</p> \n<p>The daikon and pomegranate salad recipe has also been adapted to suit my tastes. The original is a lot simpler, without pomegranate molasses or honey, and normally served to complement Uzbeki kebabs. But I love sweet and sour flavours, and the duck <em>plov</em> is so rich that my version of this salad is not at all out of place when they are put together.</p> \n<h2><strong>Duck plov</strong></h2> \n<p>Feel free to use chunks of lamb – just make sure to slow-cook them over a low heat in water or stock before adding the rice. Use plenty of fat, onions and carrots.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"016bff6b6d20b56e746947d001926c7f003c5f7e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435229888326/5135b1fe-f724-42cd-9bc0-ab6841d09c42-460x258.jpeg\" alt=\"Plov: an Uzbeki version of pilaf.

Cover with the lid again.</p> \n<p><strong>5</strong> Serve with some pickles or a sharp, crunchy fresh salad.</p> \n<h2><strong>Daikon, pomegranate and herb salad</strong></h2> \n<p>The traditional version of this dish is much simpler, more sour, and is traditionally served with kebabs.

Slice a head of fennel in half from stem to root, then slice each half thinly.</p> \n<p>Cut a large courgette into rounds. Toss the carrots, courgette and fennel in four tablespoons of olive oil and transfer to a roasting tin. Set the oven at 200C/gas mark 6.</p> \n<p>Pull the leaves from three or four stems of thyme and toss them with the vegetables. Season with salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Place a medium-sized sea bass on top of the vegetables, trickle with olive oil and season inside and out. Stuff a further three or four sprigs of thyme inside the fish’s belly.</p> \n<p>Bake for 30 minutes, until the flesh will part easily from the bones. Serves 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>It is very easy to overcook a whole fish. Start testing if it’s done after 20 minutes. Pull away a small piece of the skin, then pull at one of the larger flakes of flesh. It should slide from the bone with only the gentlest of persuasion. To serve, peel the skin away first – it should come away easily – then gently slide the fish from its bones in as large sections as possible with the help of a palette knife.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>Whole small fish can be used instead of the sea bass. Allow one per person. Use thinly sliced potatoes instead of the courgettes, green beans and carrots as the vegetables. Make a herb sauce to serve on the side, stirring lemon juice, chopped fennel fronds and capers into a thick, olive oil-enriched mayonnaise.</p> \n<p><em>Email Nigel at </em><em><a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a> </em><em>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/36be6cda4bb829c8788279714a0fb216d4a5b734/740_772_3765_2258/3765.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2258,"width":3765,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin","altText":"Baked sea bass with summer vegetables Observer Magazine OM Nigel Slater Nigel's Midweek Dinner 21/6/2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T11:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T11:00:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Nigel Slater","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/4/17/1397762419839/NigelSlater.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nigelslater"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style","Fish"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fish","webTitle":"Fish"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nigel Slater","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nigelslater"}}],"series":{"title":"Nigel Slater's midweek dinner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/nigel-slater-midweek-dinner"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/nigel-slater-baked-sea-bass-recipe","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49q2t","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/nigel-slater-baked-sea-bass-recipe","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/23/nigel-slater-baked-sea-bass-recipe"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/36be6cda4bb829c8788279714a0fb216d4a5b734/740_772_3765_2258/3765.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2258,"width":3765,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A light supper for a warm evening: baked sea bass with summer vegetables  Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","altText":"baked sea bass with summer vegetables","cleanCaption":"A light supper for a warm evening: baked sea bass with summer vegetables ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer"}},"importance":5,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/36be6cda4bb829c8788279714a0fb216d4a5b734/740_772_3765_2258/3765.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2258,"width":3765,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin","altText":"Baked sea bass with summer vegetables Observer Magazine OM Nigel Slater Nigel's Midweek Dinner 21/6/2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Jonathan Lovekin"}}]},{"title":"Nigel Slater’s apricot recipes","rawTitle":"Nigel Slater’s apricot recipes","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/nigel-slater-apricot-recipes","title":"Nigel Slater’s apricot recipes","trailText":"This once hit-and-miss fruit is now more reliable so it’s time to enjoy its versatility.

Add apricots to sweet-tasting duck or to crumble and cream for pudding</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>A perfect apricot is the most elusive of fruits. As with a peach or a plum, ripeness is all, and a good one can be tricky to track down. When you do finally find a glowingly ripe apricot, honey sweet with a pleasing pinch of acidity, and almost jelly-like flesh, it is worth eating on its own, perhaps at breakfast. Pity then, that most of the apricots we find in the shops are pretty hit and miss.</p> \n<p>At least that is how it used to be. I can’t be the only person to notice that things are looking up and over the past couple of years a decent apricot is less rare, even in supermarkets. After writing them off as a lost cause, I am buying this fruit again.</p> \n<p>If your apricots are not at the point of perfection you have two choices: one is to leave them a day or two and hope they will get there; the other is to cook with them. Even the toughest refuse-to-ripen fruit can be seduced into a decent jam with enough sugar and a bit of slow cooking. But those fruits that are on the verge will work in a pie or tart, deepening in flavour as they soften in the heat. The ripest of mine ended up adding a little tartness to a saut&eacute;ed duck breast this week, while the rest went into a loose-crusted crumbly pie. Only the perfect ones, flushed with pink and freckled with scarlet, made it to the breakfast table.</p> \n<p>The lighter, less cloying dairy produce will flatter a dish of stewed apricots (add a few verbena leaves to the syrup) without smothering. Fromage frais, young, soft goat’s cheeses, faisselle, or an unstrained yogurt are my choice. Don’t waste your time making fools and ices: the flavour will be drowned by the cream. That said, I wouldn’t say no to a trickle of unpasteurised double cream over a warm apricot pie or the crumble tart below.</p> \n<h2>Duck with apricots<br /></h2> \n<p>The duck breast is a neat, lean cut of meat that cooks quickly – qualities that can be negative or positive depending on your outlook. The meat and crisped skin of the duck works nicely with ripe apricots.</p> \n<p>I have added a few radishes for heat and crunch, and green peas as the classic duck accompaniment. Serves 2.</p> \n<p><strong>duck breasts </strong>2, boned, skin on<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>peas </strong>80g<br /><strong>radishes </strong>10<strong> </strong><br /><strong>apricots </strong>6<br /><strong>red-wine vinegar </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>butter </strong>a thin slice</p> \n<p>Put the duck breasts, skin side up, on a chopping board and slash in three or four places, going through the skin and about half way down through the meat. Season with salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Place a nonstick shallow pan over a moderate heat, pour in the oil, then place the duck, skin side down, in the pan and let the skin brown lightly. Turn the duck over, then cover the pan with a lid and let the breasts cook over a moderate heat for 7 or 8 minutes until they are brown outside and nicely pink within.</p> \n<p>Cook the peas for 4 or 5 minutes in boiling water until tender, then drain them in a colander. Trim the radishes and cut them in half. Halve the apricots and discard their stones.</p> \n<p>Remove the duck breasts to warm plates to rest. Add the radishes, apricots and drained peas to the pan, together with a little more oil if necessary. As soon as they are hot, add the red wine vinegar and butter and toss the apricots and radishes around in the butter and vinegar till all is glossy.</p> \n<p>Spoon the peas, apricots, radishes and pan juices over the duck breasts and serve.</p> \n<h2>Apricot crumble tart<br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a68ff6934fda5b68effc7894495d2f3120a94d6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540275066/d8f10d5f-c28c-4e81-9839-790d49f5fec8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'A jug of double cream or a pot of cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che might be in order here': apricot crumble tart.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It will firm up as it cools’: apricot crumble tart.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A jug of double cream or a pot of cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che might be in order here. It is essential to use ripe apricots for this, so keep them in a warm place for a day or two if you have bought them under-ripe. This is a deliberately crumbly tart which will firm up as it cools. Serves 6.</p> \n<p>For the crumble crust:<br /><strong>plain flour </strong>200g<br /><strong>sugar </strong>90g, soft, brown<br /><strong>almonds </strong>75g, ground<br /><strong>butter </strong>180g, fridge cold<br /><strong>pine kernels </strong>50g</p> \n<p>For the filling:<br /><strong>apricots </strong>350g, ripe</p> \n<p>You will also need a classic, sloping-sided tart tin measuring approximately 20cm across the base.</p> \n<p>Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4.</p> \n<p>Put the plain flour into the bowl of a food processor, add the soft brown sugar and the ground almonds. Cut the butter into small pieces, add to the bowl, then process for a few seconds, until the texture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Stir the pine kernels into the crumb mixture.</p> \n<p>Tip two-thirds of the crumble mixture into a mixing bowl and add two tablespoons of water to it. Stir the mixture so it resembles damp, slightly sticky crumbs. Press the mixture into the base and sloping sides of the tart tin. Take it slowly, pushing down firmly with a large floured spoon or your floured hand. Don’t worry if it looks rough – you want an open, crumbly texture and it will be covered with fruit later.</p> \n<p>Bake the tart case for 15 minutes, until it is pale brown in colour and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven. Halve the apricots and discard the stones. Place the apricot halves, cut side down, on the pastry crust.

The sort of food we can eat without using plates and cutlery. This month I’ve assembled a few recipes for good things we can eat with our hands, from a crisp salad in a coconut pancake to harissa flatbreads for scooping up an aubergine curry. My favourite are warm potato pancakes that I pile with smoked salmon and soured cream and I’ve included those too. So for those of you who, like me, prefer fingers to forks, this month’s recipes are for you.</p> \n<h2>Harissa flatbreads, creamed feta and onions</h2> \n<p> Makes 10-12 round flatbreads<br /><strong>strong white bread flour</strong> 500g<br /><strong>salt</strong> 10g<br /><strong>instant yeast</strong> 10g<br /><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 30g<br /><strong>warm water</strong> about 300ml<br /><strong>harissa paste</strong> 4 tsp<br /><strong>nigella seeds</strong> 1 tbsp</p> \n<p>For the filling<br /><strong>red onions</strong> 3 small<br /><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 100ml<br /><strong>chilli</strong> 1 medium<br /><strong>cucumber</strong> 1 large<br /><strong>feta</strong> 300g<br /><strong>yogurt</strong> 300ml<br /><strong>black pepper<br /></strong><strong>spring onions</strong> 3</p> \n<p>Put the flour in a large, warm mixing bowl and add the salt and the dried instant yeast. Add the butter and most of the water, then mix with your hands to bring the mixture together. Gradually add the remaining water until all the flour is mixed in.</p> \n<p>Put the dough on a lightly floured board and knead for 5-10 minutes. When the dough feels smooth and silky, place it back in the mixing bowl, cover it with a warm tea towel and leave it in a warm place to rise for at least an hour until doubled in size.</p> \n<p>Tip the dough on to a floured surface, then knead in the harissa paste and nigella seeds. Fold repeatedly until all the air is knocked out of it, then tear it into 10-12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball then into rounds about 10-12cm in diameter.</p> \n<p>Peel and finely slice the onions and put them in a small mixing bowl. Add the white wine vinegar and leave for 20 minutes, during which time they will soften.</p> \n<p>Seed and finely chop the chilli. Halve and coarsely grate the cucumber, discarding the seeds and pulp at the core. Put the cucumber and chilli in a bowl then add the crumbled feta and yogurt. Season with black pepper, and the spring onions, finely chopped.</p> \n<p>You can bake the breads if you wish (220C/gas mark 7 for 10 minutes), but I prefer to cook them on a dry, heavy, thick-based frying pan, turning them over, and letting them blister here and there.</p> \n<p>Remove them as they cook, then split each flatbread in half horizontally, gently pulling the two halves almost apart. Stuff with the onions, drained of their vinegar and the creamed feta and cucumber.</p> \n<h2>Coconut milk pancakes</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cd1faa64e4d873c997137b756c80100a9d8a5d6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434452153346/d270d0d2-4006-4b9d-8734-a50125e2343d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Vietnamese Pancake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Fine, super-thin coconut milk pancakes stuffed with crisp salad.</p> \n<p>Makes 8-10 pancakes (serves 4-5)<br /><strong>rice flour</strong> 220g<br /><strong>cornflour</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>salt</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>ground turmeric</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>coconut milk</strong> 400ml<br /><strong>cold water</strong> 300ml<br /><strong>olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>For the dipping sauce<br /><strong>limes</strong> juice of 2<br /><strong>fish sauce</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 1 clove, peeled and crushed<br /><strong>red chilli</strong> 1 small hot, halved</p> \n<p>For the filling<br /><strong>beanshoots</strong> 200g<br /><strong>a crisp lettuce<br /></strong><strong>spring onions</strong> 6<br /><strong>mint leaves</strong> from 4 sprigs<br /><strong>watercress</strong> 250g<br /><strong>shelled cooked prawns</strong> 350g</p> \n<p>Tip the rice flour into a mixing bowl, add the cornflour, salt and turmeric, then beat in the coconut milk and water with a whisk or wooden spoon.

Slice the aubergines in half lengthways, then cut each half into thin slices, about 1cm thick. Pour over the olive oil, season lightly, then toss the vegetables to coat them evenly in the oil. Bake the onions and aubergines for 45 minutes, letting them soften, turning them occasionally.</p> \n<p>Peel the ginger. In a blender or food processor, reduce the chillies, mint, coriander, lime leaves and ginger to a coarse paste, then add the coconut milk and turmeric. Scrape into a medium to large saucepan then add the roasted onions and aubergine and leave to simmer over a moderate heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>Put the flours into a large wide mixing bowl. Add the salt and most of the water and mix to a soft dough with a wooden spoon or your hands. Add the remaining water if the dough seems a little dry. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured board and knead for a good five to six minutes. It should not stick to the board, but should feel pliable and soft to the touch. Cover it with a slightly damp cloth.</p> \n<p>Pull bits of dough from the main piece and pat them into flat discs (you should get about 15). Using a floured rolling pin or pasta pin, roll them into discs about 9-10cm in diameter. Continue with the rest of the dough.</p> \n<p>Cook each flatbread in a non-stick pan for a minute or two till they have risen and lightly puffed up, then turn and cook the other side. Remove them as they cook and keep warm under a clean tea towel.

Place a pan over a low to moderate heat.

For rice-based packed lunches, an office microwave is ideal. If your office is unadorned with such technological riches, refrigerate your lunch, but take it out a little while before you eat, so it has time to come to a more palatable temperature. Food safety is key, so as soon as you have cooked your rice dish at home, refrigerate it as quickly as possible.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Make a batch of simple, veggie paella the night before. Sweat some chopped onion, red and yellow pepper, and pierced cherry tomatoes in olive oil, then add paella rice along with a glug of sherry, a pinch of saffron soaked in warm water, turmeric, smoked paprika and hot veggie stock. Put a lid on and simmer until cooked. Pack along with a lemon wedge and some parsley.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Kedgeree is delicious, but there is a time and a place for it. Fishy rice is best kept away from colleagues for the sake of your career prospects. Eggeree, however, is acceptable (probably): soak rinsed basmati rice in warm water for 30 minutes while you slowly fry a thinly sliced onion with a cinnamon stick and green cardamom seeds in lots of butter or ghee. Add the rice, followed by chilli powder and turmeric, then cover with chicken stock. Put a lid on and leave to simmer until the rice is cooked. Chill, then pack with a couple of chopped boiled eggs and parsley.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Though a founder-member of the yellow/beige food group (see also jacket potatoes and pies), egg fried rice can easily be given a fresh twist with the addition of spring veg. For one portion, finely chop one garlic clove and three spring onions. Wash and dry a small bunch of watercress, ripping off leaves, and chopping thick stems into small bits. Slice half a bunch of asparagus into small, bitesize pieces. Add &frac12; tbsp olive oil to a wok or large pan on a medium-high heat. Add garlic and spring onion and fry for a minute, until just starting to colour, then add the watercress stalks and asparagus. Cook for another couple of minutes, stirring occasionally. When just about cooked and bright green, add the watercress leaves, one tbsp of tamari, &frac12; tsp grated ginger, and 70g cooked brown rice. Cook until heated all the way through, then crack in an egg and stir furiously, scrambling, until completely cooked.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> For a super-speedy, fiery takeaway, go Korean and add 75g kimchi to your rice. Buy it from Asian supermarkets, online from websites such as <a href=\"http://www.souschef.co.uk/\">souschef.co.uk</a>, or make your own. Squeeze out as much juice from the kimchi as you can into a bowl, then roughly chop the cabbage. Add a glug of soy sauce and a teeny bit of chilli and sesame oil to the juice.

This recipe has been tweaked to just a liquid soup, which works to whet the appetite and isn’t too filling. We add a stick of celery for scooping and crunching.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>onions</strong> 2<br /><strong>carrot</strong> 1, large<br /><strong>celery</strong> 4 sticks<br /><strong>groundnut oil</strong> 3 tbsp<br /><strong>white pepper</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>Scotch bonnet pepper</strong> 1<br /><strong>tomato puree</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>smooth peanut butter </strong>2 level tbsp<br /><strong>hot vegetable or chicken stock</strong> 1l<br /><strong>sea salt flakes</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>black pepper</strong> a pinch</p> \n<p>Finely dice the onions, carrot and 2 of the celery sticks.</p> \n<p>Heat the groundnut oil in a large non-stick heavy-bottomed pan. Add the onion, carrot, celery and white pepper and cook over a medium heat with the Scotch bonnet (pierced with a sharp knife to ensure that the flavours seep out steadily) for 15 minutes, stirring at least every 5 minutes.</p> \n<p>Add the tomato puree and cook for a further minute. Stir in the peanut butter and leave to cook for another minute.</p> \n<p>Now add the stock – it’s important to add it gradually, stirring all the time. This helps the elements in the soup to meld well. Once all the stock has been added, cover with a lid and cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>Remove the Scotch bonnet pepper before blending with a hand blender for 2-3 minutes. Aim not to blend too heavily, as the soup can become too creamy (for our liking…).</p> \n<p>Top and tail the remaining 2 celery sticks, then, using a vegetable peeler, nick the ends and pull out any thick fibres. Pour the soup into bowls, then halve the celery sticks and place one in each bowl, resting on the edge. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve hot.</p> \n<h2>Pan-fried okra</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d327d288de7613dcac2725d71b14642a1b297a7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434463560940/1dc89e7d-ff97-4340-9d25-c9697b89d18d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pan fried okra\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pan fried okra</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jacob: This is a truly fantastic and simple way to cook okra. It doesn’t get slimy in the way that puts many people off, but you get a real sense of the flavour of okra enhanced by lime and honey.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>okra</strong> 400g<br /><strong>chilli oil</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>salt</strong> &frac14; tsp<br /><strong>lime</strong> &frac12;<br /><strong>runny honey</strong> 1 heaped tsp</p> \n<p>Wash the okra, trim the top of the stalks and the very tips (although not the entire end) and dry with kitchen paper. Halve each okra lengthways.<br /></p> \n<p>Heat the chilli oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the okra and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until it has softened slightly with some dark patches and begins to wilt slightly.</p> \n<p>Remove from the heat, add the salt, squeeze over the lime juice and drizzle with honey. Toss and serve hot.</p> \n<h2>Jollof sauce</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a25e7df222b04b724b811596826d25de7d873a21\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464411822/4a6ce4fb-84fc-4c33-adc4-e97308b69875-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jollof sauce\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Duval: People make jollof in different ways, incorporating preferred cooking techniques and local ingredients to their personal recipes, similar to how a paella or biryani might adapt to different regions or local traditions. Something that distinguishes the jollof that I am most familiar with is the delicious meat sauce that accompanies it. The sauce ingredients echo those in a traditional jollof rice, and it’s banging with chicken.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>onions</strong> 4<br /><strong>red peppers</strong> 3<br /><strong>small whole chicken</strong> 1 (about 1kg)<br /><strong>salt</strong> 2 tsp<br /><strong>black pepper</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>fresh thyme leaves</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>50ml<br /><strong>Scotch bonnet pepper</strong> 1<br /><strong>fresh tomatoes</strong> 2<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves<br /><strong>tomato puree</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>vegetable stock</strong> 200ml</p> \n<p>Finely slice the onions and red peppers. Chop the chicken into 12 pieces, skin them and trim off any fat. Using your hands, mix the chicken with the salt, pepper and thyme.</p> \n<p>Fry the chicken pieces in the oil with a whole Scotch bonnet pepper on a medium heat for 15 minutes, turning them every 4 minutes. Ensure each piece has room to move. Once the chicken is nicely browned, remove from the pan and put to one side.</p> \n<p>Add the onions and red peppers to the pan and fry them for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, bring a small pan of water to the boil. Gently slit the skins of the tomatoes and drop them into the boiling water. When the skin begins to come away from the flesh, take them out and peel away the skin with your hands.</p> \n<p>Crush the garlic and finely chop the skinned tomatoes. Stir the garlic, tomatoes and tomato puree into the pan of sauce, then turn the heat down to low and cook for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Return the chicken to the pan, pour in the stock and cook for a further 15 minutes. Taste and season with salt if necessary. Serve hot.</p> \n<h2>Pork in tamarind</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17ecdf94b86ca1a6571a979d41857a5ea444475f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434461686511/0b7f14e6-7833-4c97-ac20-419e906f4f27-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"PORK IN TARAMIND\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Folayemi: Tamarind is usually sold in three forms – pods, blocks and concentrate. I strongly suggest that you use the concentrate for this marinade. It’s much easier to use than pods and blocks, and it keeps for a long time too.<br /></p> \n<p>If you do have fresh tamarind pods, crack the shells and remove the case and the fibrous veins that surround the sticky pulp. Refrigerating makes them easy to peel. You can use pork loin chops for this recipe, but the shoulder is better because of the marbling of fat that run through it.</p> \n<p>This tamarind marinade can also be used to coat cubed butternut squash before roasting it until sticky and caramelised.</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>pork shoulder chops</strong> 800g<br /><strong>spring onions</strong> 6<br /><strong>carrots</strong> 2, large</p> \n<p>For the marinade<br />(Makes about 400ml)<br /><strong>tamarind concentrate </strong>4 tbsp<br /><strong>clear honey</strong> 100g<br /><strong>fresh blueberries </strong>500g, mashed<br /><strong>garlic granules</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>salt</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>smoked paprika</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>sumac</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>coarse black pepper</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>balsamic vinegar</strong> 1 tbsp</p> \n<p>Put all the marinade ingredients into a large bowl and stir well. Add the chops and cover with the marinade. Refrigerate for 2 hours.<br /></p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and roast the pork on the middle shelf for 30 minutes, then turn the oven to a medium grill setting.</p> \n<p>Remove the meat from the oven and slice it into long 1cm wide strips. Return the strips to the roasting tray with their juices, and finish them under the grill for a final 10 minutes. The marinade will concentrate and it will become even darker and stickier.</p> \n<p>While the meat is grilling, finely slice the spring onions and finely grate the carrots. Garnish the pork and serve with noodles.</p> \n<h2>Chicory and date with mustard tahini dressing</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762f1136b4a4e50b2c8027a1b05b3f2de13f6515\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464492475/a355c70e-2cf0-46e2-ac4c-d688767ad3ff-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chicory\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jacob: I became fond of chicory, or endive as it’s called in France, while living in Paris. They were alluring in the markets and I loved how crunchy and bitter they were. The dates make for a bittersweet salad and the dressing marries the two perfectly.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>chicory</strong> 2 heads<br /><strong>dates</strong> 4, stones removed<br /><strong>English mustard</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>tahini</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>clear runny honey</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>lemon</strong> juice of 1<br /><strong>fine sea salt</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>4 tbsp</p> \n<p>Wash and halve the chicory, removing any blemished areas. Remove the core at the base and separate the leaves.<br /></p> \n<p>Chop the stoned dates into small cubes by halving, cutting into strips and dicing. Working with wet hands prevents the dates from sticking.</p> \n<p>Mix the mustard, tahini, honey, lemon juice and salt in a small bowl. Gradually add the olive oil, stirring as you go until it is well combined.</p> \n<p>Add more oil or a little water if a thinner dressing is desired. Toss the dates and chicory with 3 or 4 tablespoons of dressing, and serve.</p> \n<h2>Mango kohlrabi salad</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b99a57a9d9ae5945753e29d0501eb6b830b65528\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464536332/f55c1e49-f94c-4c44-a5dd-28bde403ee33-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"mango\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Duval: This simple salad is light, fresh and tactile. It goes very well with fish. Kohlrabi can be visually intimidating but it is an easy ingredient to use. If you can’t get hold of it, you can use broccoli stalks or turnips as a substitute. It’s important to search for a very hard, green, unripe mango to achieve a crunchy salad.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>kohlrabi</strong> 1 (400g)<br /><strong>green mango</strong> 1 (400g)</p> \n<p>Trim the stalks of the kohlrabi and peel off the skin. Make sure to remove enough skin so that you are left with just the flesh of the vegetable. The area just underneath the skin is quite tough.</p> \n<p>Cut the kohlrabi into thin slices roughly 3mm wide. Take a few slices at a time, turn them on their side, and cut them into long strips. Put to one side.</p> \n<p>Peel the mango. Cut off the sides of the mango and remove as much flesh from the stone as possible. Cut the flesh into long thin slices the same width as the kohlrabi. Turn a few slices on their side at a time and cut into long strips.</p> \n<p>Toss the mango and kohlrabi together and serve.</p> \n<p><em>Extract from The Groundnut Cookbook by Duval Timothy, Folayemi Brown and Jacob Fodio Todd (Michael Joseph, &pound;20). <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/294077/s/the-groundnut-cookbook/\">Click here to order a copy for &pound;16 from the Guardian Bookshop</a></em><br /></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434461732703/888eafe0-88fe-4e75-b8a5-306f8b08d5f0-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"groundnut soup","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434463562643/1dc89e7d-ff97-4340-9d25-c9697b89d18d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Pan fried okra","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"Pan fried okra","cleanCaption":"Pan fried okra"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464413282/4a6ce4fb-84fc-4c33-adc4-e97308b69875-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"Jollof sauce","cleanCaption":" "},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434461687192/0b7f14e6-7833-4c97-ac20-419e906f4f27-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"PORK IN TARAMIND","cleanCaption":" "},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464492958/a355c70e-2cf0-46e2-ac4c-d688767ad3ff-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"Chicory","cleanCaption":" "},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464537771/f55c1e49-f94c-4c44-a5dd-28bde403ee33-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"mango","cleanCaption":" "}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T07:00:05Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T11:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":8,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["African food and drink","Books","Culture","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/african","webTitle":"African food and drink"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/six-recipes-from-the-groundnut-cookbook","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ye4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/six-recipes-from-the-groundnut-cookbook","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/six-recipes-from-the-groundnut-cookbook"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434461732703/888eafe0-88fe-4e75-b8a5-306f8b08d5f0-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Groundnut soup.
