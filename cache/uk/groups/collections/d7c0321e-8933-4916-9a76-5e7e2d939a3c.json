It is most closely associated with Liguria, in the north-west of the country, where it bears little resemblance to the soft, finely textured stuff sold in many British supermarkets. Fortunately for fans of the authentic product’s rich, chewy texture and crisp, salty crust, it’s very easy to make at home.</p> \n<h2>The flour</h2> \n<p>Your choice of flour depends very much on what kind of focaccia you’re after. Using plain flour, as in <a href=\"http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/focaccia-with-onions-genoese-style\">Marcella Hazan’s Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking</a>, or even finer “tipo 00” flour as in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/River-Cafe-Classic-Italian-Cookbook/dp/0718153499\">The River Cafe Classic Italian Cookbook</a>, will give you a softer, more tender crumb; while <a href=\"http://lovinghomemade.com/2013/04/25/homemade-focaccia-great-for-sharing/\">Richard Bertinet’s mixture</a> of strong bread flour and coarse semolina in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dough-Richard-Bertinet/dp/1856267628\">his book Dough</a> creates a more robust, chewy texture.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d8ac8676de9148b327d62dcf87d26d2aace0523\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543585407/cd870eee-fd35-4c74-b613-4aceaec86670-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Marcella Hazan's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcella Hazan’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://kitcheninthesand.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/basic-focaccia-locatellis-foolproof.html\">Giorgio Locatelli</a>’s book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Made-Italy-Stories-Giorgio-Locatelli/dp/1841157023\">Made in Italy explains</a> that, in his restaurant, they use “Italian extra-strong flour, which has a good elasticity and the power to absorb water well”. As it isn’t widely available in this country, he recommends using equal parts strong bread flour and 00 for a similar result, and I agree – his loaf does have a pleasingly springy texture without being quite as stiff as those that use strong flour alone.</p> \n<p>Angela Hartnett* is among that number, but her recipe begins with a <em>biga</em>, or starter, which requires a 24-hour fermentation before use. Her bread has a wonderful chewiness and excellent flavour – almost more like a ciabatta than the focaccia I’m used to – but I’m looking for a loaf that can be made fairly quickly and easily, which rules this step out. If you’re intrigued, however, the recipe from her book Cucina <a href=\"https://suite.io/rebecca-ford/acv2ar\">can be found here</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"700c98da26d0b5f0f52bbf452ed8e72e5e9727ec\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543639835/50ea4806-5888-46c0-b263-ddf248bf5bae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Richard Bertinet's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Bertinet’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Though I’m not going to put semolina flour in the bread itself, I do like the crunch it lends Bertinet’s version, so I will be dusting the baking tray with it, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/sep/08/how-to-cook-perfect-pizza\">as I do when making pizza</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>*</strong><em>Those surprised by the impressively browned crust on Angela’s focaccia should note that it had an accidental second baking after I left it in a cooling oven overnight, and then forgot to take it out when heating the oven the next day.

If you’d like to use fresh yeast instead of the fast-acting variety that I use, substitute 25g, or 12g of ordinary dried yeast, made up as per packet instructions.</p> \n<h2>The liquid</h2> \n<p>All focaccia contains olive oil, from a mere 2 tbsp in Hazan’s recipe to 150ml in the River Cafe version. As well as keeping the dough moist, the oil gives the bread its rich flavour, but I suspect the large quantity is also responsible for the slightly soft crust of the River Cafe loaf, so I’m going to reduce the amount slightly.</p> \n<p>The principal liquid, however – as in any bread – is water, and lots of it; Hartnett warns the novice baker not to be afraid of adding too much: “It can never be too wet – just trust me on this – it will come together. Too much flour and you end up with something resembling a doorstop.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84c867fbcf82fa4cc4a4ec431613e47da2bd57a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543485352/3205d26b-b56a-43ce-baa6-0f94c0bb365f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The River Cafe's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The River Cafe’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She’s right. The drier doughs are indeed denser and heavier, and it’s almost safest – given the difficulties of precision when it comes to hydration, which depends on any number of things from the flour you use to the humidity of the day you bake – to be as vague as the River Cafe, which simply instructs one to add enough water to make a “very soft and pliable dough”. Thus the figure below should simply be taken as a guide. As in Hazan’s recipe, add the liquid in stages until you have a soft but workable dough.</p> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>Perhaps it’s the temperature of my kitchen in comparison to that of a professional one, but I don’t find the short rising time in Locatelli’s recipe sufficient to allow the dough to double in size (which is another argument for using the instructions below as a guideline only – exactly how long everything takes will depend on the circumstances in which you make it), and making sure the dough has time to rise properly will ensure a structurally satisfactory result with plenty of air pockets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d86e3f2e5d7e4ee81b71e676c3d9df5fd3f9f3dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543696856/ab2dd7f2-bafc-43e2-ac1d-3ebd199579d8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Giorgio Locatelli's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giorgio Locatelli’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s easiest to knead wet doughs like this in a food mixer, but if you don’t have one, oil your work surface rather than flouring it, so that you don’t add any more dry ingredients to the mix.</p> \n<p>That said, Locatelli’s bread boasts the best examples of those “dimples” that are such a characteristic feature of the focaccia – I think because his are made directly before baking, as opposed to before the second proof.</p> \n<h2>The baking</h2> \n<p>As with all breads, a very hot oven gives the best results – and baking it on a hot pizza stone or sheet, as Hartnett and Hazan suggest, will give your bread a pleasingly crisp bottom. Spraying a little water into the hot oven to create steam, as the former also recommends, will also help to create a decent crust.</p> \n<h2>The brine</h2> \n<p>Locatelli and others pour a mixture of oil, water and salt on top of their loaves before baking, which, as the River Cafe observes, may seem strange “but the water helps to keep the dough soft and moist in some of the grooves”. Be careful not to overdo it, though, or the loaf won’t brown on top. And don’t feel the need to overload it with salt, either: a mere teaspoon should be quite sufficient given how much there is in the dough.</p> \n<p>Do feel free to add herbs (rosemary sprigs are nice), olives, tomatoes, and so on. And, if you’re feeling really adventurous, the River Cafe even does a dessert version with black grapes and fennel seeds. Personally, I’d draw the line at <a href=\"http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/30955/salted-caramel-and-apple-focaccia\">this salted-caramel version</a>, but each to their own.</p> \n<h2>The perfect focaccia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d20f84446ee76b10f6d30fda6acca7d93c3ea95b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543810111/93d60cdd-269b-442c-a461-64fb77ae19dc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong><em>(Makes one large loaf)</em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>375g strong white bread flour</strong><br /><strong>375g “tipo 00” flour (sometimes sold as pasta flour)</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp fine sea salt</strong><br /><strong>8g active dry yeast</strong><br /><strong>130ml extra-virgin olive oil (100ml for the dough; 30ml for the topping, mixed with 30ml water and 1 tsp salt flakes)</strong><br /><strong>Water</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp coarse semolina or cornmeal (optional)</strong></p> \n<p>Put the flours in a large mixing bowl with the salt and yeast. Whisk well to combine, then make a hole in the middle and add 100ml olive oil, plus 300ml water. Stir together and add more water (I used about 100ml more) until you have a very soft, but not too sticky, dough.</p> \n<p>Knead until soft and elastic; in a food mixer (preferable) on a medium-slow speed for about 7 minutes, or by hand on a lightly oiled work surface for 10-12 minutes. Put the dough on a lightly oiled rimless baking sheet and leave to rise in a draught-free place for 60-90 minutes until roughly doubled in size.</p> \n<p>Knock back the dough, and lightly dust the baking tray with the semolina, if using. Gently press the dough out with your fingers to fit the baking tray. Brush with olive oil and leave to rise again for about another hour, or until doubled in size again. When this time has nearly elapsed, heat the oven to 220C and put a pizza stone or baking tray in there to heat up. If you have a water spray, ready it.</p> \n<p>Whisk together the remaining 30ml olive oil with 30ml water until emulsified. Transfer the dough to you pizza stone or baking tray and poke dimples into the surface of the focaccia with your fingertips. Pour the oil-and-water mixture on top and scatter with the salt flakes, then place in the oven and squirt a little water into the base of the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden on top – keep an eye on it.

New York is the sandwich capital of the world, and while many New Yorkers may not take much of a lunch break, they do know a thing or two about a lunchtime takeaway. With this in mind, here are a few NYC deli-inspired lunches.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Make yourself some speedy, healthier, pizza slices. Try chickpea-flour bases: gradually whisk an equal volume of water into gram flour. Add a pinch of salt and any herbs you wish, then leave to stand. Then fry in butter on both sides in a nonstick pan until golden. Finish with any toppings you wish – pesto, roasted or raw veg, ham and creme fraiche... and grill.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Nothing beats a good bagel and nowadays, brands like the New York Bakery Co are ubiquitous. Prepare and toast a bagel at work, ideally. Otherwise, pack it ready-to-eat tightly in Tupperware rather than foil or clingfilm. Cream cheese is a classic starting point, but needs some robust flavours to counter all that creamy sweetness: try topping with capers, thinly sliced red onion, tomato and lots of freshly ground black pepper. Or try our friend Olivia’s delicious and simple mackerel pat&eacute;: mash cream cheese with smoked mackerel, a squeeze of lemon juice and zest, chopped parsley and lots of pepper. Pack into a small Tupperware, and refrigerate when you get to work, unless you want to incur your colleagues’ wrath. Spread on your – preferably warm – bagel at lunch. A couple of slices of dill pickle would not go amiss.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> You may not have access to a store like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satriale%27s_Pork_Store\">Satriale’s</a>, but you can still make an Italian sub (or “hoagie”) that Tony Soprano wouldn’t sniff at. Whisk together 1 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp red wine vinegar, &frac12; tsp dijon mustard and a pinch of dried oregano. Split a submarine roll, discard any excess crumbs (keep for breadcrumbs) and sprinkle the dressing over both halves. Lay a couple of slices of gouda or emmental on the bottom, then top with a selection of sliced cured meat (mortadella and salami are our faves, but go wild with whatever you can find in the sliced meat aisle). Whatever you choose, be generous. Top with shredded iceberg, thinly sliced red onion, and sliced jarred sweet peppers or olives. Close and wrap in a tight bodybag of greaseproof paper secured with a couple of elastic bands.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> If you work carefully and finish the assembly at work, a luxury hotdog will make you the envy of your colleagues. Cook a baguette in a hot oven alongside your sausages. Meanwhile mix plenty of mustard and paprika into the contents of half a tin of beans, then pack in a small microwaveable container. When the baguette is cooked, take out some of the middle, spread with a layer of mayonnaise and pop in your sausages for safekeeping until lunch (wrap the whole thing in foil). Thinly slice some spring onion and red chilli. Pack in a container. Come lunchtime, place your hotdog baguette folded open on a plate, and heat the beans in a microwave until piping hot. Pour over your sandwich and finish with the spring onion and chilli.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing are authors of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/little-book-of-lunch.html\">The Little Book of Lunch</a> (Square Peg)</em><br /></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Lifeandhealth/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434023645308/NYC-deli-lunches-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"With an easy-to-prepare luxury hotdog, you can be the envy of hungry colleagues.

It’s the time for new takes on seasonal classics to be enjoyed in the garden</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>It has come to that point in the year when I want food that is light, gently flavoured and peaceful. No loud notes or vivid colours on my plate, just mild, quietly seasoned food for a summer’s day. Tempting as it is to bring out the summer classics – bowls of chilled cucumber soup, or perhaps a crab salad, a plate of cold salmon with herb mayonnaise or a pork pie – I hate the idea of food standing still. There is too much fun to be had.</p> \n<p>I made a soup this week, a broth of green peas and lettuce. Even though we ate it hot, it tasted clearly of the season. Green and light, it seemed only right to eat it in the garden. I introduced a fresh, acidic note with a rather generous amount of lemon, adding brightness to the roasted chicken broth. To make it more substantial I made toasts of ciabatta with olive oil and grated parmesan to dunk in it as we ate.</p> \n<p>The same principle, of introducing something sharp or sour to what is essentially a mild dish, included making pickled vegetables to dress a ball of creamy burrata. Courgettes and thin-skinned kohlrabi brought a crunchiness to the soft, quivering cheese, the vegetables having been given a brief pickling in vinegar, lemon and horseradish. I could have used a firmer mozzarella or even feta, but burrata is the number one summer cheese for me.</p> \n<p>Other ways I like to freshen up well-known summer classics include roasting a salmon with lemon and tarragon (tuck the herbs inside the belly of the fish with a slice of butter, squeeze the lemon over the fish and add the empty shells to the tin). I also like to add chopped radishes and even a little ripe chilli to a cold cucumber soup and let their heat liven it up.</p> \n<p>At dessert level, it can be fun to update the old summer pudding recipe with a shot of sloe gin, or by adding a layer of lemon syllabub before the cream to a fruit trifle. In our house, even strawberries and cream get a new look with a splash of raspberry pur&eacute;e and peppery basil over the berries.</p> \n<h2>Lettuce soup with parmesan toasts</h2> \n<p>The flavour will stand or fall on the quality of the stock, so it is worth making your own. I use wings rather than a whole chicken and roast them before making the stock.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br />For the chicken stock:<br /><strong>chicken wings</strong> 8<br /><strong>water</strong> 1.5 litres<br /><strong>onion </strong>1 medium-sized<br /><strong>thyme</strong> 8 sprigs<br /><strong>bay leaves</strong> 2<br /><strong>black peppercorns</strong> 6</p> \n<p>For the soup:<br /><strong>chicken stock</strong> 1 litre (see above) <br /><strong>peas</strong> 300g, frozen is fine<br /><strong>lettuce</strong> 400g<br /><strong>mint </strong>8 leaves<br /><strong>lemon </strong>half</p> \n<p>For the toasts:<br /><strong>ciabatta</strong> 4 thick slices<br /><strong>olive oil</strong><br /><strong>parmesan</strong> 3 tbsp grated</p> \n<p>Make the roast chicken stock by putting the chicken wings into a roasting tin, pour over the oil then roast for 40 minutes or until golden brown and lightly crisp-skinned.</p> \n<p>Transfer the roasted wings to a deep pot, pour some of the water into the roasting tin and stir to dislodge any juices stuck to the tin. Pour into the pot with the rest of the water, add the onion, peeled and cut in half, the thyme, bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer. Using a draining spoon remove any froth that comes to the surface and discard. If you leave it there it will make your stock cloudy. Let it simmer for an hour then strain through a fine sieve.</p> \n<p>Bring the chicken stock to the boil. Add the peas and let them cook in the stock for four or five minutes, until tender. Lower the heat to a simmer then add the shredded lettuce. Tear up the mint leaves and stir them in, together with the juice of the half lemon and a seasoning of salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Toast the bread on one side, using an overhead grill, then turn over and trickle with olive oil. Dust the surface with grated parmesan and toast until the parmesan has started to melt and turn golden. Ladle the soup into four warm bowls then float the toasts on top and serve.</p> \n<h2>Burrata with pickled vegetables</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e17164d176678067bdb22b25843658a9c805e75\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943859119/2db0bde8-8c28-4de5-b147-1d1fea528e97-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Perfect as a light main course.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>red onions</strong> 2<br /><strong>lemon </strong>juice of 1<br /><strong>kohlrabi</strong> 500g<br /><strong>fresh horseradish</strong> 20g, fresh<br /><strong>yellow courgette </strong>1<br /><strong>green courgette </strong>1<br /><strong>white-wine vinegar</strong><br /><strong>burrata </strong>2</p> \n<p>Peel the red onions and slice them thinly, to about the thickness of a 10p piece.

You don’t need to peel it if the skin itself is thin and unblemished. Push the kohlrabi through a grater or food processor fitted with a coarse blade.

My Sicilian mother-in-law had already told me more or less the same thing, but I didn’t tell Gianluca that. The first life is the beautiful, vivid green feathery fronds, which have a distinct, dill-like nature and make a good seasoning, especially stirred into pasta. The second is the first layer of the bulb, which is often thick and not quite as tender as the rest but has great flavour, so good for soup. The third life is the heart of the perfectly white bulb, sweetly crisp, which makes an excellent salad.</p> \n<p>It was nearly six years ago when Gianluca shared his fennel wisdom, but I still think about it when I buy fennel from him, which I do often, as it is a favourite vegetable. What Gianluca calls three lives another friend calls batch-thinking: shopping for things you know can provide you with more than one meal, meals you can then sketch into your mental plan for the week. I say “sketch” because it suggests plenty of flexibility. For a batch of fennel, my suggestion would be: on day one, make the soup for the following day (it is better after mellowing for a day) and have the pasta for supper. On day three, make the baked fennel (lovely with a pork chop) and one of the salads to have with fish on the fourth day.<br /></p> \n<p>If you’re especially resourceful, you can prepare the baked fennel on day one alongside the soup. Simmer the fennel for the gratin in a pan of salted water, then use the same (beautifully flavoured) water to boil your spaghetti, keeping the fennel under clingfilm in the fridge until you’re ready to use it.</p> \n<h2><strong>To prepare the fennel</strong></h2> \n<p>You will need four large or six medium-size fennel bulbs (which should weigh about 1.8kg in total). Fennel is trimmed before it reaches the shops, but there are usually a few feathery fronds at the top of each bulb, which are delicious and reminiscent of wild fennel, so look for bulbs with as many fronds as possible. Cut away the darker green fingers and fronds and set aside for the pasta. Cut the base from each bulb and then remove the first thick layer and set aside for the soup. The bulbs are for the baked fennel and the salad: keep these wrapped in a clean tea towel in the fridge.</p> \n<h2><strong>The soup</strong>: f<strong>ennel and carrot soup</strong></h2> \n<p>The slightly tougher outer layer of fennel – given a bit of help and a nice long simmer – makes a soup as delicious as it is resourceful. This is based on my no-recipe soup: a sofrito of carrot, onion and celery plus the vegetable (fennel) cooked gently in olive oil and butter, booze (vermouth), a flavour-imbuing parmesan rind, appropriate herb (bay), water or stock, reduced to a puree. Like most soups, it is infinitely better the next day.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />A small knob of butter, plus more for serving<br />1 large onion, peeled and finely diced<br />2 celery stalks, finely chopped<br />1 large carrot, peeled, finely chopped<br />1 parsnip or turnip, peeled and finely chopped<br />1 garlic clove, peeled and finely chopped<br />Salt and black pepper<br />600g fennel (outer layers only), roughly chopped <br />2 bay leaves<br />1 potato, peeled and diced<br />2 tbsp of vermouth, sherry or marsala<br />1 parmesan rind<br />1 litre water or light vegetable stock</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> In a large, heavy-based pan, warm the olive oil and butter, add the chopped onion, celery, parsnip, garlic and a pinch of salt and cook slowly until they are soft and translucent.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Add the fennel, bay leaves, potato, vermouth and another pinch of salt to the pan, stir and cook for another minute or two.</p> \n<p><strong>3 </strong>Add the parmesan rind and water or stock. Bring the soup to a simmer and cook for 20-40 minutes, depending on the size and age of the veg and the pan size. Keep tasting: you will know.</p> \n<p><strong>4 </strong>Once the soup is ready, remove the parmesan rind. Using a hand-held blender, reduce the soup to a puree. Taste and season as needed. Serve with a little olive oil poured over the top or a spoonful of soured cream.</p> \n<h2><strong>The pasta dish</strong>: s<strong>paghetti with fennel fronds, sardines, lemon zest and chilli</strong></h2> \n<p>You only need a few feathery fronds, with their distinct aniseed notes, to lend flavour to a dish. I particularly like them stirred into hot pasta, at which point they wilt accommodatingly for a tame storecupboard version of the Sicilian classic <em>pasta con le sarde</em> (pasta with wild fennel and sardines). The sardines, sharpened by zest, given heat by the chilli and lifted with a waft of aniseed, make for a delicious and quick-to-make dinner. Inspired by Rowley Leigh and a similar dish he makes with rocket, I often top this with anchovy breadcrumbs, which elevates it to brilliant.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ade58cc40d2d1ddd445dc8e446d577402eac0f3a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434013616198/c1020070-22a6-4963-8d6a-6d0bcc90bdd7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Spaghetti with fennel fronds, sardines, lemon zest and chilli\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This pasta is a simplified version of Sicilian pasta con le sarde, and can be served with optional anchovy breadcrumbs.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Yuki Sugiura/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br />450g spaghetti<br />3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br />2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped <br />A pinch of red pepper flakes<br />A few fennel fingers, finely chopped <br />100g tinned sardines, drained and broken up with a fork<br />A handful of fennel fronds, roughly chopped<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />Salt</p> \n<p><strong>1 </strong>Bring a large pan of water to a fast boil, add salt (the rule of thumb is 10g to every litre) and drop the spaghetti into the water.

Usually it is simply trimmed and quartered, and to be eaten like fruit. Alternatively, it is sliced very thinly and mixed with slices of orange and black olives, which is a surprising and exquisite combination – the citrus, crisp, faintly aniseedy fennel and meaty olives contrast brilliantly.

There’s rarely a better way to spend a sunny evening than outdoors, drink in hand, with friends and family; however grateful they were on the night, though, the blame for fuzzy heads laid firmly at my door the next day. All more than worth it, of course, to test these stellar cocktail recipes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/jun/07/cocktails-recipe-swap-felicity-cloake\">Readers' recipe swap: Cocktails | Felicity Cloake</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Proceedings began with Angela Dawson’s rhubarb and custard; the sweet syrup and heady vanilla vodka was perfectly balanced by the bitterness of tonic water; aromatic and delicate, it dispelled any preconceptions of it being as sweet as the name suggests. Next came withmustard’s vodka thyme lemonade; I failed to track down the citric acid, so rimmed the glass with the sugar and thyme mix instead. The result was an impressively sophisticated drink with minimal fuss - definitely one for the recipe scrapbook for all year round. The masala chai and mint rum infusion from binnyshah made for something deliciously complex, worth trying for the wonderful smell of the infused rum alone. Fadime Tiskaya’s pomsecco took a little longer to prepare, but would be a great welcome drink for any guests you might have this summer, the sharpness of the lime and tonic offsetting the sweet peaches, pomegranate and prosecco, something altogether more interesting than the usual bellini. A grapefruit tea with whiskey from TwinnyDip, filled with bitter and smoky notes, was super-refreshing on a warm day, as was Paddy MacLachlan’s take on the Mexican michelada. Tomato juice, beer and soy sauce may not be to everyone’s taste, but personally, I could drink it by the gallon.</p> \n<p>As hard as it was to pick a winner, once my powers of reasoning were restored, Clairetweet’s ruby gin fizz ticked all the boxes. Using seasonal fruits with a refreshing zip of lime and a few generous splashes of gin, it’s an unmistakable taste of summer that’s as easy to make as it is to drink.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/10/henry-dimbleby-drinks-peach-slushie\">Make your own peach slushie </a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>The winning recipe: ruby gin fizz</strong></h2> \n<p>Really, nothing could be easier than a gin fizz.

I’ve been making it regularly ever since, as rhubarb cordial has a wonderful flavour, a brilliant colour and keeps well for a week or so in the fridge; we’ve mixed it with gin and cava before now, but this is our favourite creation.<br /><em>Angela Dawson, Taunton</em></p> \n<p><strong>Makes enough cordial for 8 drinks<br /></strong><strong>For the cordial<br /></strong>400-450g rhubarb, chopped<br />250g sugar<br />Juice of &frac12; a lemon<br />500ml water</p> \n<p><strong>For the cocktails<br /></strong>1 part vanilla vodka (which you can buy, or make by steeping a vanilla pod in good quality vodka for a couple of months)<br />2 parts rhubarb cordial<br />3 parts tonic water</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Put the rhubarb, sugar, lemon and water in a pan, bring to a boil, then simmer until the rhubarb has disintegrated.

In fact, it’s what gives Mexican food much of its distinctive taste. I feel a peculiar sense of pride that charring is all the rage over here, too, because I’m sure the trend stems from the huge interest in real Mexican cooking the world over. Viva Mexico!</p> \n<h2><strong>Grilled cauliflower with charred tomato chilli dressing</strong></h2> \n<p>If there is one thing you cook this month, let this be it. It’s a fabulous side for grilled fish, or for barbecued chicken or pork chops, or just as it is in a meze spread. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>125g puy lentils</strong><br /><strong>1 bay leaf</strong><br /><strong>2 garlic cloves, smashed</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>2 cauliflowers, leaves removed</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>1 handful parsley leaves, roughly chopped</strong></p> \n<p>For the tomato dressing<br /><strong>1 scotch bonnet chilli</strong><br /><strong>2 plum tomatoes</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; clove garlic, peeled</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong><br /><strong>1 pinch brown sugar</strong><br /><strong>130ml olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put the lentils in a saucepan with the bay leaf and garlic. Cover with water, bring to a simmer and cook gently for 25-30 minutes, until the lentils are just tender but still holding their shape. Drain, and reserve two tablespoons of the cooking liquid; discard the rest, and the garlic and bay. Stir the oil into the lentils and season to taste.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, put your oldest, most knackered heavy-based pan on a high heat. Once hot, add the chilli and tomatoes for the dressing, and dry-roast until blackened all over, about 10 minutes: the blacker they are, the more flavour will come through in the dressing. Put the charred tomatoes in a blender. Cut open the chilli lengthways and scrape away the seeds and membrane – try not to touch either, or you will have very spicy fingers for several hours. Add the chilli and garlic to the blender, and blitz to a thick puree. Add the vinegar and sugar, season generously and, with the motor running, add the oil in a slow, steady stream until the dressing is emulsified. Season to taste – it can take quite a bit of salt.</p> \n<p>Put a griddle pan on a high heat. Cut the cauliflower vertically into 1cm-wide slabs (keep any florets that fall off for a salad, say). Rub the slices in oil and season. Grill in batches for eight to 10 minutes, turning halfway, until lightly toasted and tender in the middle; adjust the flame if they seem to be burning. Transfer to a warm place and repeat with the remaining cauliflower.</p> \n<p>Lay the cauli on plates, spoon over the lentils and drizzle on dressing. Scatter on the parsley and serve.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-74e3dbef-e266-44e9-bcb5-f5e6a95a8cbb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433947449744/5e144a13-80ff-4cc8-94e6-eec45142f12d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Warm red peppers with tarragon, caper and egg&nbsp;dressing\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ warm red peppers with tarragon, caper and egg dressing: Chargrilling gives Mexican food much of its distinctive taste.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian.

Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>4 large red peppers</strong><br /><strong>A few slices rustic bread (or sourdough)</strong><br /><strong>1 large knob butter</strong><br /><strong>1-2 garlic cloves (to taste –I like mine garlicky), peeled and chopped very fine</strong></p> \n<p>For the dressing<br /><strong>2 medium free-range eggs</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp Dijon mustard</strong><br /><strong>150ml extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp red-wine vinegar</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp cornichons (or 1 small pickled gherkin)</strong><br /><strong>1 heaped tsp capers, rinsed and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 handful tarragon leaves, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 handful parsley leaves, finely chopped</strong></p> \n<p>Turn on a gas flame (or, if using an electric hob, heat up an old frying pan instead) and roast the peppers directly over the flame – put them on a wire rack, if need be – for eight to 12 minutes (longer if roasting in a pan on an electric ring), turning regularly, until black and blistered all over. Transfer to a bowl, cover with clingfilm and leave to sweat for 10 minutes (this makes them easier to peel).</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, bring a pan of water to a boil, cook the eggs for 10 minutes, drain and plunge into cold water. Peel the eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. In a large bowl, mash the yolks with the mustard, then dribble in the oil in a thin trickle, whisking as you go, as if you’re making mayonnaise. (If you add the oil too quickly, the sauce will split, but don’t worry too much, because it may well come back together; it won’t affect the taste.) Once all the oil is combined, stir in the vinegar.</p> \n<p>Chop the egg white and cornichons into small dice, then add to the sauce with the capers. Stir in the tarragon, half the parsley and a splash of water, then add more vinegar, mustard or salt to taste, and set aside.</p> \n<p>Blitz the bread into crumbs in a food processor. Melt the butter in a frying pan, add the garlic and fry for a few minutes, until golden. Stir in the crumbs and fry until golden, about 10 minutes. Peel the peppers, discarding the stems and as many seeds as you can, and tear into quarters. Drape over a pretty plate, drizzle with the dressing, then sprinkle with the rest of the parsley and the golden crumbs.</p> \n<h2><strong>And for the rest of the week…</strong></h2> \n<p>The charred tomato dressing transforms everything from fried eggs on toast to toasted goat’s cheese salad and grilled mackerel. It’s so versatile, I might even try it with vanilla ice-cream next. The egg and caper dressing is a classic sauce gribiche, which is delicious on grilled leeks or grilled baby gems, or as a straight dip. Roast extra peppers – they keep well under a film of oil – for adding to sandwiches and wraps, or for blitzing with garlic and oil to make a mouth-watering puree that goes particularly well with fish.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433947305925/Grilled-cauliflower-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thomasina Miers' grilled cauliflower with charred tomato dressing: A fabulous side for grilled fish, barbecued chicken or pork chops, or as part of a meze spread.
