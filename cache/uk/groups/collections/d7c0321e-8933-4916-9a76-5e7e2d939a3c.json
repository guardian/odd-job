Pork belly is cheap to buy and when cooked well can be exquisite, but you can use pork loin if you prefer. Ask your butcher to score the skin of the belly, or do it yourself with a Stanley knife (the cuts should be no more than 1cm apart and be deep enough to cut through the rind to form crackling).</p> \n<p>Serves 4-6<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 2, crushed with a pinch of salt<br /><strong>ground fennel seeds</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>organic or free-range pork belly</strong> 1.5kg, in one piece, skin on and scored<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>fino sherry or white wine</strong> 150ml<br /><strong>a splash of water</strong> (optional)<br /><strong>sea salt and black pepper</strong></p> \n<p>Mix the garlic with the fennel seeds and rub over the flesh of the belly. Place on a large board, skin-side up, and dry the skin thoroughly. Generously sprinkle with fine sea salt (about 1 tbsp) all over the scored skin. Leave for half an hour, then dust off excess salt.</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 230C/gas mark 8. Transfer the pork to a large roasting tin greased with the olive oil and place in the hot oven on the top shelf. It is important that the oven is really hot to start with, as this intense heat is required to blister the skin and turn it into crackling. Roast at this high heat for a good 30 minutes until hard crackling has formed, then turn the heat down to 190C/gas mark 5 and transfer to a clean roasting tin. Continue cooking for another 2-2&frac12; hours (35 minutes if loin) until the meat is soft and tender. Remove from the oven, transfer to a chopping board and leave to rest, loosely covered with foil to keep warm, for 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the gravy. Pour off any excess oil, and place the roasting tray on the hob on a low to medium heat. Deglaze with the sherry or white wine, scraping the juices off the bottom of the pan as you go. Simmer for a couple of minutes to reduce the alcohol, then taste for seasoning. If it tastes too strong, add a splash of water. Keep hot. To serve the pork we often take it off any ribs beforehand as it is easier to slice.<br /><em>From Moro The Cookbook by Sam &amp; Sam Clark (Random House, RRP &pound;20).</em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/moro-cookbook.html\"><em> Click here to buy it from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;16</em></a></p> \n<h2>Nieves Barrag&aacute;n Mohacho’s classic tortilla</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6715d04777e5e44ca964c4f66e335371cf43dd67\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435157392129/2499a8f9-9f99-4689-8aec-9467d366fef9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Classic tortilla Barrafina\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A mandolin, if you have one, is best for slicing the potatoes.</p> \n<p>Serves 4 as a tapa or light lunch<br /><strong>vegetable oil</strong> 650ml<br /><strong>potatoes</strong> 750g, peeled and sliced into &frac12;cm rounds<br /><strong>onions</strong> 600g, peeled and sliced into very thin half-moons<br /><strong>free-range eggs</strong> 6<br /><strong>Maldon salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>olive oil </strong>1-2 tbsp</p> \n<p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan until it is just beginning to smoke.

Sprinkle some flour on a clean work surface and roll out the pastry to a 3mm thickness. Cut out discs from the pastry about 12cm in diameter and transfer onto a floured tray. Repeat the process with the leftover pastry: you should end up with 12 discs of pastry. Transfer to the fridge to chill.</p> \n<p>Prepare your filling. For the cumin and paprika-spiced chicken and spinach, heat a saut&eacute; pan over a low heat and add a lug of olive oil. Add the paprika and cumin and cook gently for 1 minute. Add the spinach, season and cook until fully wilted. Drain the spinach, cool and roughly chop. Mix with the chicken, parsley and lemon juice.</p> \n<p>For the ricotta, peas and mint, mix all the ingredients together and check the seasoning.</p> \n<p>When the pastry has chilled, remove from the fridge and place a heaped teaspoon of filling in the centre of each disc, leaving a 2cm border around the edges. Brush some egg wash on one half of the border and pull the other half over the top of the filling to meet the eggy side.</p> \n<p>Press down and seal the pastry, ensuring there are no gaps. You will have a half moon shape with a bulge of filling in the centre. The pastry is quite robust but will become warm with too much handling, so you should work fairly swiftly. Crimp the sealed edge with a fork to give the classic empanadilla finish. Brush all over with egg wash and pop in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Bake the empanadillas on a floured, non-stick oven tray for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is piping hot – a knife inserted into the centre of the empanadilla will come out hot.

Pull the needles from the rosemary and mix them with the onions and tomatoes. Pour over the oil, tossing everything together. Place the whole head of garlic, unpeeled, among the tomatoes.</p> \n<p>Bake the tomatoes and onions for an hour, with the occasional stir, until the onions are soft, sticky and lightly coloured and the tomatoes have darkened.

But fresh beets that you have cooked yourself are a world away from the dodgy pickled sort, and brighter, firmer, and more full of earthy flavour than those (admittedly convenient) ready-cooked, vacuum-packed numbers. They’re adaptable, too: as happy in wedges as they are grated or whizzed into a puree.</p> \n<p>Grappling with fresh beets can leave your kitchen looking a little bit like an episode of CSI. Luckily, baking beetroot in a steamy foil parcel (our favoured method) requires little active cooking or clearing-up time, and produces perfectly tender roots.</p> \n<p>Bake a batch at the beginning of the week and store in an airtight container in the fridge once cool. The roots tend to hog all the attention, but we like to make the most of the whole bunch by using the stalks in a salad and saving the leaves to make a thrifty pasta, so do buy the freshest, sprightliest looking bunches you can find.</p> \n<p><strong>To roast the beetroot</strong><br />1kg beetroot (about 2 small bunches)</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Set the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Rinse the beetroot. Chop off the stalks and leaves (leaving around 2cm of stalk attached) and dry these thoroughly. Store the stalks and leaves wrapped in damp kitchen paper in the fridge.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Grappling with fresh beets can leave your kitchen looking a little bit like an episode of&nbsp;CSI</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Line a high-sided roasting dish with a large piece of foil; big enough to fully enclose the beetroot – and turn the sides up to prevent leakage. Add the beetroot and 350ml water, then fold the foil over the top like a parcel. Bake until cooked. This will take around 1 hour – when a knife slides through them easily, they are ready.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Remove and leave to cool before peeling – you should be able to just push the skin off. If there are tough areas, use a peeler. You may want to pull on some rubber gloves before getting involved, though we rarely bother.</p> \n<h2><strong>The weeknight comfort dish: Beetroot and pearl barley ‘risotto’ (pictured above)</strong></h2> \n<p>In spite of the drama of its deep colour, this is a simple vegetarian dish, perfect for weeknights when you need something soothing and comforting.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br />150g pearl barley<br />2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, for frying<br />1 medium carrot, finely chopped<br />1 stick of celery, finely chopped<br />6-8 shallots, finely chopped <br />2 garlic cloves, finely sliced<br />300g roasted beetroot, grated<br />1 tsp dried thyme<br />250ml white wine<br />450ml chicken or vegetable stock<br />Juice of 1 lemon<br />Crumbled feta, to serve<br /></p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> First, cook the pearl barley. Rinse the barley under the tap, then transfer to a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 40 minutes.

Add the garlic and beetroot, then sprinkle over the thyme. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent the mix from catching. Turn the heat up and add the wine. Cook until the alcohol has reduced by half.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Using a slotted spoon, transfer the barley to the casserole dish, and add a few ladles of hot stock to cover. Season, then stir continuously with a wooden spoon, adding more stock as necessary, until the barley is tender and the liquid has been absorbed. (If you have plenty of beetroot leaves, pop a handful into the pot at this point).</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Squeeze in the juice from half the lemon, then taste to check the seasoning. Add more salt and lemon juice, to taste.</p> \n<p><strong>5</strong> Serve in bowls, with a scattering of feta and a final drizzle of olive oil on top.</p> \n<h2><strong>The summer starter: Beetroot and garlic dip</strong></h2> \n<p>This pretty pink dip is a classic way to make use of leftover cooked beetroot.

Cut the beetroot stalks into roughly 3cm pieces.

Leave it to sit for 2 hours, or overnight.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> To make the fritters, coarsely grate the beetroot into a large bowl. Add salt and pepper, cumin, egg and gram flour, and mix well. If the mixture seems too wet, add a bit more flour. Crumble in the cheese, then add the dill, and give it all another good stir.</p> \n<p><strong>5</strong> Add oil to a large pan and heat until very hot (throw in a small test piece of mixture; if it sizzles then you’re good to go). Scoop 1 tbsp of the raw fritter mixture from the bowl, form it into a ball-shaped patty in your hands and place in the pan. Repeat. (We find 3 fritters to be the optimal number to fry at a time, but it will depend on the size of your pan).</p> \n<p><strong>6</strong> Cook for 30 seconds, before pressing down on each patty with a spatula, so they squish out and become larger and thinner. Fry for around 4 minutes on each side, until crisp and golden. Remove to a plate lined with kitchen paper and keep warm while you cook the rest.</p> \n<p><strong>7</strong> Complete the salad by dividing the rocket between plates, topping with the stalk-onion mix and sprinkling over the chopped walnuts.</p> \n<p><em>Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing are the authors of The Little Book of Lunch (Square Peg) and the forthcoming The Cornershop Cookbook (Square Peg)</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435227300898/f5c86c98-0272-4d5c-a4f8-0f9fdca82cb4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian","altText":"Beetroot and pearl barley ‘risotto’ ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228425818/3a0b5602-70bf-4888-bfe1-17a2282fff76-2028x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":2028,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"You could simply serve the dip as a starter, or atop a couple of baked sweet potatoes.

Fry the veal in two batches until golden on the outside and cooked through – three to four minutes a side. Alternatively, fry the schnitzels ahead of time for a minute a side, until golden, and finish in a hot oven for 10 minutes just before you eat. Serve with the salad and perhaps quinoa or new potatoes tossed in chopped mint and butter.</p> \n<h2><strong>Peach, vanilla and basil galette</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-2bb3153a-a90a-4fc5-a60d-e4a8300558df\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140124273/0f292ad1-3686-4550-bb31-032b863da5c2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' peach, vanilla and basil galette\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ peach, vanilla and basil galette: absurdly impressive yet oh-so-simple.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian. Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This stunning pudding is deceptively easy, because the rough, hotchpotch shape hides a multitude of sins. Simply throw together the quick pastry, assemble the pie and bake – you’ll be amazed by the result. Serves six.</p> \n<p>For the pastry<br /><strong>170g self-raising flour</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp caster sugar</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp sea salt</strong><br /><strong>120g cold, unsalted butter cut into cubes</strong><br /><strong>4 tbsp ice-cold water</strong></p> \n<p>For the galette<br /><strong>8 basil leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>60g golden caster sugar, plus 1 tbsp extra</strong><br /><strong>Seeds scraped from &frac12; vanilla pod</strong><br /><strong>5 peaches, peeled, stoned and quartered</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp ground almonds</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp plain flour</strong></p> \n<p>To finish<br /><strong>1 tbsp melted butter</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp granulated sugar</strong></p> \n<p>For the pastry, put the flour, sugar and salt in a food processor, and blitz briefly. Add the butter and pulse for a few moments, until the butter is only half incorporated – for gloriously flaky pastry, you need lumps of butter the size of small chickpeas. Add the cold water a tablespoon at a time, pulsing after each addition, until the mix begins to clump, then tip out on to a clean work surface and push together into a disc. Wrap in clingfilm and refrigerate for at least an hour. Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Bash the basil in a pestle and mortar, then add the 60g caster sugar and vanilla seeds, and carry on bashing until you have what looks like green sugar. Transfer to a bowl, add the peaches, toss and set aside.</p> \n<p>Roll the pastry into a roughly 25cm circle and transfer to a baking sheet lined with baking paper. Mix the ground almonds, flour and remaining caster sugar, and sprinkle over the rolled-out dough, leaving a 3cm clear border around the edge. Pile the sugary basil and peach mix inside the borders of the pastry and bring up the sides of the pastry, crimping and folding them round the fruit. Brush the pastry with the melted butter, sprinkle over the granulated sugar and bake for 30 minutes, rotating the tart from time to time to ensure an even bake, until the pastry is golden and the fruit’s slightly coloured. Leave to cool slightly, and serve with cream or vanilla ice-cream.</p> \n<h2><strong>And for the rest of the week…</strong></h2> \n<p>Schnitzels always create a bit of a mess – the flour, egg and crumbs never go where they’re meant to – so I often make more and stash the extra schnitzels in the freezer. They’ll feel like a real gift when, tired and hungry, you remember them on a rushed Thursday night. Just defrost, and roast or fry. Tomato salad apart, schnitzel goes brilliantly with crushed new potatoes (oven-roast until crisp), or with avocado and lettuce salad, or boiled corn on the cob, or spinach puree. Make extra pastry, too, because that also freezes well. And if you have a surfeit of unripe peaches, worry not: they are really good sliced and tossed in sugar, olive oil, mint and a splash of wine vinegar.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435139992169/Thomasina-Miers-veal-schn-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thomasina Miers' veal schnitzel with rainbow tomato salad: a great summer dish.

After this selection of fruity concoctions and spicy Asian-inspired sauces, a splash of balsamic and a drizzle of olive oil will no longer cut it. And, as a result of this week’s testing, I’m also much more amenable to salad for dinner, too.</p> \n<p>The rhubarb and rosemary dressing from TwinnyDip gave a sweet and aromatic contrast to a feta, avocado and lamb’s lettuce salad, and I’m thinking any leftover rhubarb syrup would be a wise addition to a gin or vodka-based cocktail.</p> \n<p>The Mexican-inspired flavours of Zoe Guttenplan’s punchy cumin and lime dressing were the perfect match for a chicken, tomato and black bean lunchbox, while TheWholeIngredient’s peanut miso dressing turned a cold bean sprout, carrot and cucumber noodle bowl into a substantial show-off dish.</p> \n<p>Angela Kim’s green coconut dressing was also great on noodles, as she suggested, and will enliven a bowl of rice and steamed white fish or salmon for a quick after‑work dinner. Jodiehodgson’s offering was akin to a caesar or ranch dressing, only with a much more spritely edge. Lots of fresh herbs, garlic and yoghurt suit it to romaine or round lettuces, topped with soft-boiled eggs and chunky croutons.</p> \n<p>In the end though, it was a raspberry dressing from Suzanne Anderegg that got my vote. Taking less than a minute to make, this tangy, sweet and beautifully pink dressing turned everything from simple green salads to a pea, broad bean and goat’s cheese dish into something much more visually striking. It also managed to keep people guessing a little and will keep in the fridge for a week.</p> \n<h2><strong>The winning recipe: Raspberry dressing </strong></h2> \n<p>This is my favourite salad dressing for sunny days and can be used on just about everything.<br /><em>Suzanne Anderegg, Milton Keynes</em></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br />100g fresh or defrosted raspberries<br />2 tbsp balsamic vinegar<br />2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil</p> \n<p>1 Simply blend the ingredients together using a hand blender and pour over your salad.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rhubarb and rosemary dressing</strong></h2> \n<p>We love the distinctive taste of rhubarb.

When fruit is right, it’s wrong to play around with it. But with summer fruit season in full swing, I find myself (always an overzealous shopper when the fruit’s there and ripe) with a glut piled so high in the fruit bowl that every so often a peach will roll drunkenly out with a thud. At these times, there’s nothing for it but to make fruit tarts,; and put the bruised bounty to good use.</p> \n<h2><strong>Peach and black pepper frangipane tart</strong></h2> \n<p>Peach and almond are made for one another, but they can verge on cloying if a third ingredient doesn’t perk them up. Here, it’s black pepper that adds that spark – lending a little heat which, along with the brightness of the orange zest, sets the sweet frangipane and fruit into sharp relief.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br /><strong>For the pastry</strong><br />135g plain flour<br />75g butter<br />50g ground almonds<br />30g caster sugar<br />A pinch of salt<br />1 large egg<br />Mascarpone, to serve</p> \n<p><br /><strong> For the filling</strong><br />75g unsalted butter, softened<br />50g caster sugar<br />50g runny honey<br />1&frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />Zest of 1 orange<br />100g ground almonds<br />1 large egg, plus 1 large egg yolk<br />50g plain flour<br />1&frac12; tsp coarse black pepper, plus extra for sprinkling<br />&frac34; tsp baking powder<br />A generous pinch of salt<br />2-3 large peaches, skins left on, cut into slim segments</p> \n<p>1 Rub the flour and butter together in a large bowl. Keep working the ingredients using your fingertips until no visible chunks of butter remain. Stir in the ground almonds, caster sugar and salt. Whisk the egg lightly, then add half of it to the flour mixture, cutting it into the dry ingredients. Continue adding until the dough begins to form in clumps. You shouldn’t need more than &frac34; of the egg. Once all the flour has been moistened, press the dough into a ball, flatten slightly and wrap in clingfilm. Refrigerate for 20 minutes or so, during which time the dough will become less sticky.</p> \n<p>2 Roll out the chilled dough on a lightly floured work surface until it’s 26-27cm in diameter – big enough to line the base and sides of a 23cm-round tart or flan tin. You can also use a 20cm round loose-bottomed cake tin, if that’s all you have – just bake the filled tart for slightly longer to cook the slightly deeper filling. Line the tin with the pastry, prick all over the base with a fork and place in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes (this’ll reduce the risk of the pastry shrinking as it bakes). Meanwhile, set the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.</p> \n<p>3 Beat the butter and sugar together until light and creamy, then stir in the honey, vanilla extract, orange zest, ground almonds, egg and egg yolk. Combine the flour, pepper, baking powder and salt in a separate bowl before adding to the almond mixture and folding gently until smooth.</p> \n<p>4 Spoon the filling into the chilled pastry case, then arrange the peach slices neatly on top in concentric circles and grind plenty of black pepper on top. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven before reducing the temperature to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and cooking for a further 25 minutes. The pastry should be crisp, the filling slightly risen and springy, and the peaches perfectly tender. Leave the tart to cool to room temperature in its tin. Serve barely warm, with sweetened mascarpone.</p> \n<h2><strong>Strawberry vanilla custard tarts with pine nut crust</strong></h2> \n<p>The modest handful of pine nuts in this recipe round out what might otherwise have been an otherwise bland of a plain pastry case, while also making it richer, and crumblier, than ever.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 6</strong><br /><strong>For the pastry</strong><br />60g pine nuts<br />150g plain flour<br />75g unsalted butter<br />40g caster sugar<br />30ml milk</p> \n<p><br /><strong> For the filling</strong><br />175ml milk<br />2 large yolks<br />50g caster sugar<br />2&frac12; tsp cornflour<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />50ml double cream<br />250g ripe strawberries<br />2-3 tbsp strawberry jam</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, then roast the pine nuts for 7-10 minutes, checking them regularly, until they’ve darkened a shade and are beginning to look oily. Turn the oven off for the moment. Set aside 10g of the toasted nuts in a small bowl – you’ll use these to top the tarts later – and empty the bulk of the kernels into a food processor or coffee grinder. Pulse them until they’re finely ground, slightly greasy and starting to clump together.</p> \n<p>2 Put the flour in a large bowl and rub the ground pine nut mix into it with your fingers. Cube the butter and add it to the bowl, rubbing it into the dry ingredients until there are no visible chunks of butter left. Stir in the sugar, then add the milk, cutting it in until a dough forms in small clumps. If it’s too dry to hold together when you squeeze it, add a drop more milk. Gather the dough into a ball, pat it flat and wrap in clingfilm. Place in the fridge to chill for 20 minutes or so.</p> \n<p>3 Lightly dust the work surface and roll out the chilled pastry until it’s 3-5mm thick. Cut rounds out using a circular pastry cutter – one big enough to make circles of pastry to line the base and sides of the holes ofa standard muffin/cupcake tin. Gently press the pastry into the tin holes, taking care not to stretch it. Chill the lined tin in the fridge for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.</p> \n<p>4 Once the pastry cases have chilled, trim off any excess and line each with a small square of baking parchment (it can help to scrunch the parchment then smooth it out again before doing this, to help it mould to the contours of the pastry). Fill each parchment-lined tart with baking weights – whether the ceramic sort, or just makeshift ones such as dried chickpeas, rice or barley – and bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Remove the weighted parchment parcels and return to the oven to cook for a further 5 minutes uncovered, then leave to cool.</p> \n<p>5 Heat the milk for the custard until scalding. While the milk warms, whisk the egg yolks, sugar, cornflour and vanilla extract together in a mixing bowl. Slowly pour the scalding milk into this yolk mixture, whisking constantly as you go. Decant the mixture back into the pan and set over a low heat. Stir the custard over the heat for 5 minutes or so, until it’s very thick and gloopy. Cover the surface with clingfilm to stop a skin forming, then leave to cool to room temperature. Beat the cooled custard to smooth it before adding the cream and whisking for a minute. The custard should hold soft peaks.</p> \n<p>6 Hull and halve the strawberries. Fill each tart case with a generous dollop of the custard, then top with the strawberry pieces – I find four half-strawberries per tart is about the right amount, clustered together into a dome shape. Warm the strawberry jam, strain it and brush a little over each of the tarts to glaze. Chop the remaining toasted pine nuts and sprinkle them over the tarts. Serve straight away.T</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228754665/68ac0eda-a1f9-4c9b-9e5c-43427555669a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"A peach and almond tart with a twist of black pepper for piquancy, and the classic pairing of strawberry and vanilla in an extra-crumbly pine-nut tart case.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T04:59:06Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T04:59:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":7,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style","Fruit"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fruit","webTitle":"Fruit"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a5c2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/27/fruit-tart-recipes-peach-black-pepper-strawberry-vanilla-custard"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228710181/d9af8e4d-669f-4522-9723-b41d06ddad6b-2060x1247.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1247,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A peach and almond tart with a twist of black pepper for piquancy, and the classic pairing of strawberry and vanilla in an extra-crumbly pine-nut tart case.
