This recipe has been tweaked to just a liquid soup, which works to whet the appetite and isn’t too filling. We add a stick of celery for scooping and crunching.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>onions</strong> 2<br /><strong>carrot</strong> 1, large<br /><strong>celery</strong> 4 sticks<br /><strong>groundnut oil</strong> 3 tbsp<br /><strong>white pepper</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>Scotch bonnet pepper</strong> 1<br /><strong>tomato puree</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>smooth peanut butter </strong>2 level tbsp<br /><strong>hot vegetable or chicken stock</strong> 1l<br /><strong>sea salt flakes</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>black pepper</strong> a pinch</p> \n<p>Finely dice the onions, carrot and 2 of the celery sticks.</p> \n<p>Heat the groundnut oil in a large non-stick heavy-bottomed pan. Add the onion, carrot, celery and white pepper and cook over a medium heat with the Scotch bonnet (pierced with a sharp knife to ensure that the flavours seep out steadily) for 15 minutes, stirring at least every 5 minutes.</p> \n<p>Add the tomato puree and cook for a further minute. Stir in the peanut butter and leave to cook for another minute.</p> \n<p>Now add the stock – it’s important to add it gradually, stirring all the time. This helps the elements in the soup to meld well. Once all the stock has been added, cover with a lid and cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>Remove the Scotch bonnet pepper before blending with a hand blender for 2-3 minutes. Aim not to blend too heavily, as the soup can become too creamy (for our liking…).</p> \n<p>Top and tail the remaining 2 celery sticks, then, using a vegetable peeler, nick the ends and pull out any thick fibres. Pour the soup into bowls, then halve the celery sticks and place one in each bowl, resting on the edge. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve hot.</p> \n<h2>Pan-fried okra</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0d327d288de7613dcac2725d71b14642a1b297a7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434463560940/1dc89e7d-ff97-4340-9d25-c9697b89d18d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pan fried okra\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pan fried okra</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jacob: This is a truly fantastic and simple way to cook okra. It doesn’t get slimy in the way that puts many people off, but you get a real sense of the flavour of okra enhanced by lime and honey.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>okra</strong> 400g<br /><strong>chilli oil</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>salt</strong> &frac14; tsp<br /><strong>lime</strong> &frac12;<br /><strong>runny honey</strong> 1 heaped tsp</p> \n<p>Wash the okra, trim the top of the stalks and the very tips (although not the entire end) and dry with kitchen paper. Halve each okra lengthways.<br /></p> \n<p>Heat the chilli oil in a large frying pan on a medium-high heat. Add the okra and cook for 3 minutes, stirring frequently, until it has softened slightly with some dark patches and begins to wilt slightly.</p> \n<p>Remove from the heat, add the salt, squeeze over the lime juice and drizzle with honey. Toss and serve hot.</p> \n<h2>Jollof sauce</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a25e7df222b04b724b811596826d25de7d873a21\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464411822/4a6ce4fb-84fc-4c33-adc4-e97308b69875-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jollof sauce\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Duval: People make jollof in different ways, incorporating preferred cooking techniques and local ingredients to their personal recipes, similar to how a paella or biryani might adapt to different regions or local traditions. Something that distinguishes the jollof that I am most familiar with is the delicious meat sauce that accompanies it. The sauce ingredients echo those in a traditional jollof rice, and it’s banging with chicken.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>onions</strong> 4<br /><strong>red peppers</strong> 3<br /><strong>small whole chicken</strong> 1 (about 1kg)<br /><strong>salt</strong> 2 tsp<br /><strong>black pepper</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>fresh thyme leaves</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>50ml<br /><strong>Scotch bonnet pepper</strong> 1<br /><strong>fresh tomatoes</strong> 2<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves<br /><strong>tomato puree</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>vegetable stock</strong> 200ml</p> \n<p>Finely slice the onions and red peppers. Chop the chicken into 12 pieces, skin them and trim off any fat. Using your hands, mix the chicken with the salt, pepper and thyme.</p> \n<p>Fry the chicken pieces in the oil with a whole Scotch bonnet pepper on a medium heat for 15 minutes, turning them every 4 minutes. Ensure each piece has room to move. Once the chicken is nicely browned, remove from the pan and put to one side.</p> \n<p>Add the onions and red peppers to the pan and fry them for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, bring a small pan of water to the boil. Gently slit the skins of the tomatoes and drop them into the boiling water. When the skin begins to come away from the flesh, take them out and peel away the skin with your hands.</p> \n<p>Crush the garlic and finely chop the skinned tomatoes. Stir the garlic, tomatoes and tomato puree into the pan of sauce, then turn the heat down to low and cook for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Return the chicken to the pan, pour in the stock and cook for a further 15 minutes. Taste and season with salt if necessary. Serve hot.</p> \n<h2>Pork in tamarind</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"17ecdf94b86ca1a6571a979d41857a5ea444475f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434461686511/0b7f14e6-7833-4c97-ac20-419e906f4f27-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"PORK IN TARAMIND\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Folayemi: Tamarind is usually sold in three forms – pods, blocks and concentrate. I strongly suggest that you use the concentrate for this marinade. It’s much easier to use than pods and blocks, and it keeps for a long time too.<br /></p> \n<p>If you do have fresh tamarind pods, crack the shells and remove the case and the fibrous veins that surround the sticky pulp. Refrigerating makes them easy to peel. You can use pork loin chops for this recipe, but the shoulder is better because of the marbling of fat that run through it.</p> \n<p>This tamarind marinade can also be used to coat cubed butternut squash before roasting it until sticky and caramelised.</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>pork shoulder chops</strong> 800g<br /><strong>spring onions</strong> 6<br /><strong>carrots</strong> 2, large</p> \n<p>For the marinade<br />(Makes about 400ml)<br /><strong>tamarind concentrate </strong>4 tbsp<br /><strong>clear honey</strong> 100g<br /><strong>fresh blueberries </strong>500g, mashed<br /><strong>garlic granules</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>salt</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>smoked paprika</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>sumac</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>coarse black pepper</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>balsamic vinegar</strong> 1 tbsp</p> \n<p>Put all the marinade ingredients into a large bowl and stir well. Add the chops and cover with the marinade. Refrigerate for 2 hours.<br /></p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and roast the pork on the middle shelf for 30 minutes, then turn the oven to a medium grill setting.</p> \n<p>Remove the meat from the oven and slice it into long 1cm wide strips. Return the strips to the roasting tray with their juices, and finish them under the grill for a final 10 minutes. The marinade will concentrate and it will become even darker and stickier.</p> \n<p>While the meat is grilling, finely slice the spring onions and finely grate the carrots. Garnish the pork and serve with noodles.</p> \n<h2>Chicory and date with mustard tahini dressing</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762f1136b4a4e50b2c8027a1b05b3f2de13f6515\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464492475/a355c70e-2cf0-46e2-ac4c-d688767ad3ff-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chicory\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jacob: I became fond of chicory, or endive as it’s called in France, while living in Paris. They were alluring in the markets and I loved how crunchy and bitter they were. The dates make for a bittersweet salad and the dressing marries the two perfectly.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>chicory</strong> 2 heads<br /><strong>dates</strong> 4, stones removed<br /><strong>English mustard</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>tahini</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>clear runny honey</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>lemon</strong> juice of 1<br /><strong>fine sea salt</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>4 tbsp</p> \n<p>Wash and halve the chicory, removing any blemished areas. Remove the core at the base and separate the leaves.<br /></p> \n<p>Chop the stoned dates into small cubes by halving, cutting into strips and dicing. Working with wet hands prevents the dates from sticking.</p> \n<p>Mix the mustard, tahini, honey, lemon juice and salt in a small bowl. Gradually add the olive oil, stirring as you go until it is well combined.</p> \n<p>Add more oil or a little water if a thinner dressing is desired. Toss the dates and chicory with 3 or 4 tablespoons of dressing, and serve.</p> \n<h2>Mango kohlrabi salad</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b99a57a9d9ae5945753e29d0501eb6b830b65528\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464536332/f55c1e49-f94c-4c44-a5dd-28bde403ee33-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"mango\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Duval: This simple salad is light, fresh and tactile. It goes very well with fish. Kohlrabi can be visually intimidating but it is an easy ingredient to use. If you can’t get hold of it, you can use broccoli stalks or turnips as a substitute. It’s important to search for a very hard, green, unripe mango to achieve a crunchy salad.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>kohlrabi</strong> 1 (400g)<br /><strong>green mango</strong> 1 (400g)</p> \n<p>Trim the stalks of the kohlrabi and peel off the skin. Make sure to remove enough skin so that you are left with just the flesh of the vegetable. The area just underneath the skin is quite tough.</p> \n<p>Cut the kohlrabi into thin slices roughly 3mm wide. Take a few slices at a time, turn them on their side, and cut them into long strips. Put to one side.</p> \n<p>Peel the mango. Cut off the sides of the mango and remove as much flesh from the stone as possible. Cut the flesh into long thin slices the same width as the kohlrabi. Turn a few slices on their side at a time and cut into long strips.</p> \n<p>Toss the mango and kohlrabi together and serve.</p> \n<p><em>Extract from The Groundnut Cookbook by Duval Timothy, Folayemi Brown and Jacob Fodio Todd (Michael Joseph, &pound;20). <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/294077/s/the-groundnut-cookbook/\">Click here to order a copy for &pound;16 from the Guardian Bookshop</a></em><br /></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434461732703/888eafe0-88fe-4e75-b8a5-306f8b08d5f0-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"groundnut soup","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434463562643/1dc89e7d-ff97-4340-9d25-c9697b89d18d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Pan fried okra","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"Pan fried okra","cleanCaption":"Pan fried okra"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464413282/4a6ce4fb-84fc-4c33-adc4-e97308b69875-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"Jollof sauce","cleanCaption":" "},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434461687192/0b7f14e6-7833-4c97-ac20-419e906f4f27-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"PORK IN TARAMIND","cleanCaption":" "},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464492958/a355c70e-2cf0-46e2-ac4c-d688767ad3ff-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"Chicory","cleanCaption":" "},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464537771/f55c1e49-f94c-4c44-a5dd-28bde403ee33-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"Toby Glanville and Sophie Davidson","altText":"mango","cleanCaption":" "}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T07:00:05Z","lastModified":"2015-06-21T07:00:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["African food and drink","Books","Culture","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/african","webTitle":"African food and drink"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/six-recipes-from-the-groundnut-cookbook","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ye4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/six-recipes-from-the-groundnut-cookbook","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/six-recipes-from-the-groundnut-cookbook"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434461732703/888eafe0-88fe-4e75-b8a5-306f8b08d5f0-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Groundnut soup.

Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the sure signs that summer is in full swing are the boxes of Alphonso mangoes stacked up outside my local Lebanese grocer. They are so sweet and juicy that it is impossible to eat them without getting into a sticky mess – a far cry from the larger, green varieties you get in supermarkets all year round. They also make a brilliant chilled fruit salad that’s wonderful after barbecued chicken.</p> \n<h2><strong>Thai barbecued chicken with warm coconut and rice salad</strong></h2> \n<p>Spatchcock the chicken (or ask your butcher to), so as much of the surface as possible is exposed to the flame. Marinate the bird for at least two hours, preferably overnight – the extra wait is well worth it. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>1 medium chicken</strong><br /><strong>1 bunch coriander, stalks and leaves separated </strong><br /><strong>Zest and juice of 2 limes</strong><br /><strong>2 green chillies, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped </strong><br /><strong>3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 sticks lemongrass, outer layer removed, chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sunflower oil</strong><br /><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp palm sugar (or demerara, or any kind of brown sugar)</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp fish sauce</strong></p> \n<p>For the rice salad<br /><strong>250g jasmine rice, soaked for 30 minutes</strong><br /><strong>400ml coconut milk</strong><br /><strong>50g coconut flakes, toasted</strong><br /><strong>80g raisins, soaked in warm water</strong><br /><strong>3 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced</strong><br /><strong>2 carrots, peeled and cut into julienne</strong><br /><strong>Juice of 1 lime</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sesame oil</strong><br /><strong>80g roasted cashew nuts, chopped</strong></p> \n<p>Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut along the length of the chicken’s backbone on both sides, then remove and discard the bone. Put the bird breast side up on a board and press down on the breastbone until it cracks and the bird flattens out.</p> \n<p>Roughly chop the coriander stalks and put in a food processor with the lime zest and juice, chillies, ginger, garlic and lemongrass, and blitz to a paste. Cut a few slashes into the legs and breasts of the chicken and put the bird in a clean plastic bag with no holes. Add three big tablespoons of the paste, the oil and a good grind of salt and pepper, then rub the marinade into the chicken, making sure it gets into all the nooks and crannies. Wrap in a second plastic bag, so it doesn’t leak, and marinate in the fridge for two hours or overnight.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: finely shave the palm sugar with a knife and put into a bowl with the fish sauce. Mash a little with a fork, then slowly work in the excess chilli paste, which will dissolve the sugar. Roughly chop the coriander leaves and stir into the bowl. Adjust the lime, sugar and fish sauce to taste, so it’s perky and savoury.</p> \n<p>If you are using a barbecue, light it an hour before you want to eat, to give the charcoal time to get to the right temperature; otherwise, heat a griddle pan at least five minutes before cooking, so it gets good and hot. Grill the chicken, turning from time to time, until the skin is crisp and charred and the flesh cooked through – about 30 minutes (test for doneness by inserting a skewer into the thickest part of the leg: the juices should run clear; and if the bird seems to be cooking too quickly on the outside, lower the heat). Rest in a warm spot for 10 minutes before you carve.</p> \n<p>To make the salad, put the rice, coconut milk and a teaspoon of salt in a saucepan, and add cold water to cover the rice by 3cm. Bring to a boil, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook on a high heat for five minutes. Turn the flame to its lowest setting, cook for eight minutes more, then take off the heat and leave, covered, to finish steam-cooking. When the rice is tender, after about 10 minutes, run a fork through it to separate the grains. Mix in the coconut flakes, drained raisins, spring onions and carrot, and season with lime juice, sesame oil, salt and pepper. Toss, check the seasoning and transfer to a salad bowl. Scatter over the cashew nuts and serve with the chicken and dipping sauce.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chilled mango salad in anise-lime syrup</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a7007927-1cfb-4b67-9f15-ad4bad1dd2c4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434379015237/49606bc1-24ba-44a6-a58e-f69aef4f966b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' chilled mango salad in anise-lime syrup\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ chilled mango salad in anise-lime syrup: use alphonsos, if possible – they’re so much sweeter, juicier and stickier than supermarket green mangos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian.

It’s a great way to round off a meal. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>2 fat ripe mangoes</strong><br /><strong>60g agave syrup</strong><br /><strong>Zest and juice of 2 limes</strong><br /><strong>1 star anise</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp 100% agave tequila (optional)</strong><br /><strong>1 small handful fresh mint leaves</strong></p> \n<p> Peel and dice the mangoes, and put in a bowl. Put the agave syrup, lime zest and juice, star anise, chilli and tequila (if using) in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Cook gently for five minutes, then turn off the heat and leave the mixture to cool and the flavours to infuse. When the syrup is cool, pour it on the mangoes and transfer to the fridge to marinate for an hour. Serve scattered with torn mint leaves, perhaps with some vanilla or coconut ice-cream.</p> \n<h2>And for the rest of the week…</h2> \n<p>I always make at least a double batch of the chilli paste, because it freezes so well. Whip it straight out of the freezer and mix into quick, Thai-style pork or beef meatballs. Pan-fry and serve with rice, or cram into baguettes with chilli-laced mayo, or poach in a soothingly spicy Thai-scented broth. Make extra rice salad, too, and take some to work – come lunchtime, you’ll be the envy of the office; sprinkle any excess dipping sauce on stir-fries or use as a marinade for tofu. I love leftover mango salad for breakfast, though instead of ice-cream and mint, I stir in some berries and top with a dollop of thick yoghurt and some toasted coconut flakes or granola.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434378783993/Thomasina-Miers-Thai-styl-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Johanna Parkin for the Guardian.

It shows Dorothy and her younger brother (both&nbsp;to the left) walking to school in Bamburgh, Northumberland, from their home at Budle Bay with three friends. The girls clutching their wild flowers and the children in their ill-fitting hand-me-down clothes make a&nbsp;touching sight.</p> \n<p>Mum’s father was the head gardener and game keeper at the “big house” at Waren Mill; her mother cleaned there and looked after the five children. Money was in short supply and I don’t think the family had a camera. Instead, a passing motorist (rare in those days) took the photograph and sent it along with a letter to my mother, asking about her life. His name was John Heywood of Sale, Cheshire, and he wrote: “Everyone I show it to smiles back, so keep on smiling …” And she did. Mum was renowned for her smile and happy disposition. She married my&nbsp;father when he was stationed at Bamburgh during the war, and we returned there every year for our family holiday. I still go back and walk the road from Budle Bay. It hasn’t changed and I can visualise my mother and uncle walking to school with their&nbsp;friends.</p> \n<p><em>Gwen Irving</em></p> \n<h2>Playlist: How a song changed the course of my life </h2> \n<p><strong>An Angel by the Kelly Family</strong></p> \n<p><em>“I wish I had your pair of wings / Had them last night in my dreams / I was chasing butterflies / Till the sunrise broke my eyes”</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIGGVIkcyWU\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIGGVIkcyWU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>My husband and I were born and bred on different continents, with more than 11,500km between us. I lived with my mum and sister in a village of&nbsp;1,000 inhabitants in the west of Slovenia, whereas his hometown in Argentina had more than 15m people. But, in 1995,&nbsp;one song started a series of events that brought us together.</p> \n<p>The Kelly Family were becoming more and more successful in Europe, but until 3 March 1995, I had heard about them only in passing. It was the last school dance of the year and, for the final song of the evening, I – at that time, a very shy 14-year-old – gathered up the courage to ask the boy I fancied for a dance. He said “yes” and I was so nervous throughout the whole dance that I didn’t even notice which song it was that we were so awkwardly moving our feet to.</p> \n<p>It was only the following day when I&nbsp;heard the song An Angel playing on the radio that it hit me. From that moment on, the date – 3 March – and&nbsp;the song became sacred to me. I&nbsp;celebrated them both for many years to come.</p> \n<p>In no time, I had become a huge Kelly Family fan and even fantasised about marrying Paddy, one of the younger siblings in the group. When they moved from Germany to Ireland, my interest in the Emerald Isle began to bud. Knowing my mother and her protective ways, I drew up an agreement stating that, when I reached 18, she would allow me to travel to Ireland. She signed it reluctantly, hoping it was just a phase that I would soon get over and thinking I would never have enough money to pull it off, anyway. After all, the financial reality for my family had been tough since my father died 10 years earlier and everybody who knew our situation was quick to discard my dream as nothing more than wishful thinking.</p> \n<p>By the time I was 18, I had grown out of my Kelly Family fixation, but my obsession with Ireland was in full bloom. Against all the odds, I travelled to Ireland that summer and found the landscape and the people as enticing as I had imagined them to be. Even the&nbsp;weather cooperated and there wasn’t a drop of rain through out my whole stay.</p> \n<p>But it was in 2002, the third time I&nbsp;visited Ireland, that the island worked its magic on me. I attended a summer school of Irish music and dance in Limerick, and that’s where I met a South American boy who not only shared my love for Ireland, but turned out to have been born on 3 March. Only five minutes into the conversation, I&nbsp;knew he was “the one” (he, on the&nbsp;other hand, needed a few more days). On meeting him, the circle was&nbsp;complete.</p> \n<p>Three years later and many flying miles under our belts, we settled in Slovenia. My husband, a musician himself, first heard of the Kelly Family through me and never warmed to their music. But to this day, I stop as if in a&nbsp;trance, whenever I hear that special song – the song that started it&nbsp;all.</p> \n<p><em>Ksenija Yoder Batic </em></p> \n<h2>We love to eat: Tommy Mess, invented for Grandma</h2> \n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br /><em>4 meringue nests</em><br /><em>1 tub of whipping cream</em><br /><em>Bowl of blueberries, strawberries and&nbsp;raspberries</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"62607657aa206f5208cf62fe84685a15470ecf1c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434388222261/7e050a85-0126-4bae-9e45-6c39558b2c73-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom and Eva with Tommy Mess.\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom and Eva with Tommy Mess.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Whip cream and line up the meringue nests. Scoop blobs of cream into each nest and arrange the fruit on top.</p> \n<p>Having moved from “up north” (Lancashire) to “down south” (Poole), it’s always a treat for us when family come to down to sunny Dorset to visit. Our four-year-old twins, Tom and Eva, get very excited, especially in the run-up to a visit.</p> \n<p>They want to help get the guest room ready and, of course, go to meet and greet the visitors at the train station. Part of the preparation involves planning meals, and when I&nbsp;ask&nbsp;for help, it usually involves requests for fish and chips.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In preparation for my mother-in-law’s visit, a trip to the supermarket with the twins was in order, and after making the mistake of asking what pudding we should make for Grandma, bypassing suggestions of iced gems and brioche rolls, Eva spotted some meringue nests and so we decided on our own version of Eton Mess.</p> \n<p>When it was finally time to prepare the pudding, my two little helpers were eager to lick the spoons and bowls. I&nbsp;gave them free rein to assemble the dish, and they piled lashings of cream and fruit on top of the meringue. Eva&nbsp;looked at Tom’s and decided to call it Tommy Mess – as the name suggests, it wasn’t the neatest of puddings but it tasted very good.</p> \n<p>Now Tommy Mess is always on the menu when we have visitors.</p> \n<p><em>Kate Cameron</em></p> \n<h2>We’d love to hear your stories<br /></h2> \n<p>We will pay &pound;25 for every Letter to, Playlist, Snapshot or We love to eat we publish.

The heaviness of suet is certainly off-limits, as are hefty gateaux, steamed puddings and ladlefuls of hot custard. Heavy chocolate concoctions, and those rich with cream, caramel and syrup, sit uneasy in the summer heat, too. But lighten dessert up with a touch of something floral and the whole thing comes back into focus: sweet, mild camomile alongside a tart pineapple curd perhaps, or a quivering orange-blossom panna cotta with strawberries. You could play around with rose or even lavender buds if you’re brave, and watch your baking come to full bloom.</p> \n<h2><strong>Summer pineapple camomile cake</strong></h2> \n<p>This mellow camomile cake sits perfectly with the sharpness of a thick layer of bright pineapple curd.

It’s just as good on toast, through ice-cream, on your little finger as in is in this cake, so I doubt you’ll have trouble using it up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e0925e898bb8e70aace4a395bf453e76f061879\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434624197142/b073f732-08a3-4567-a334-4ad5c80a1347-460x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Summer pineapple camomile cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruby’s summery pineapple camomile cake.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You can use camomile teabags if you can’t find the loose flowers – just swap 1 teabag per tablespoon of dried camomile buds. They’re less potent, though, so give them plenty of time to steep and do source loose camomile if you can. Health food stores sometimes have it, or look online at souschef.co.uk.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 10-12</strong><br />250g unsalted butter<br />100ml milk<br />6 tbsp dried camomile buds<br />300g caster sugar<br />Zest of &frac12; lemon<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />4 large eggs<br />350g plain flour<br />3 tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp salt</p> \n<p><strong> For the curd</strong><br />2 large egg yolks<br />1&frac12; tbsp cornflour<br />40g caster sugar<br />100ml pineapple juice<br />Juice from 1 lemon<br />1 tbsp unsalted butter</p> \n<p><strong> For the icing</strong><br />225g unsalted butter<br />6 tbsp dried camomile flowers<br />300g white chocolate<br />200g icing sugar<br />Zest of &frac12; lemon<br />15-25ml milk, if needed</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Grease and line two 20cm round cake tins – preferably loose-bottomed or springform ones.</p> \n<p>2 Combine the butter, milk and camomile in a pan and set over a low heat until the butter has completely melted and the mixture has just begun to simmer. Remove from the heat and leave to cool and infuse for 5 minutes or so before straining into a large mixing bowl, leaving the camomile flowers behind while squeezing as much liquid from them as possible.</p> \n<p>3 Add the sugar, lemon zest and vanilla extract to the infused butter mixture and whisk to combine. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt before adding this dry mixture to the wet ingredients. Whisk until the batter is smooth, then divide it between the prepared tins.</p> \n<p>4 Bake for 25-30 minutes, until well-risen and golden brown. A small knife inserted into the middle of each cake should emerge clean. Leave to cool in their tins before unmoulding.</p> \n<p>5 While the cakes are cooking and cooling, make the curd. Whisk the egg yolks, cornflour and sugar together in a small pan, then slowly add the pineapple and lemon juices. Set the pan over a low heat and stir constantly for 5-10 minutes – as long as it takes for the curd to reach the consistency of very thick custard. It’ll be resolutely liquid for the first few minutes, but don’t give up on it. As soon as it’s ready and just about to start bubbling, remove it from the heat, stir in the butter and leave it to cool to room temperature.</p> \n<p>6 To prepare the icing, melt the butter with the camomile over a low heat until the butter starts to bubble. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for 10 minutes before sieving out the camomile flowers. While the butter cools a little, chop the white chocolate into small chunks and melt in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (you can also melt it carefully in the microwave in short bursts, if you’d rather). Stir the melted white chocolate into the slightly cooled, strained butter and leave to cool to room temperature.</p> \n<p>7 Once the butter and chocolate mixture has cooled, put the icing in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm to the consistency of softened, creamed butter. Stir it at 5 minute intervals to avoid lumpiness. Once it’s thick and smooth, add the icing sugar and lemon zest and gently mix. Add a dash of milk, if necessary, to give a spreadable, buttercream texture.</p> \n<p>8 Spread a few dollops of the curd on top of one cake layer, sandwich it with the other, then spread the icing evenly over the top and sides of the sandwich. Drizzle the top with a little more curd or scatter with dried camomile flowers.</p> \n<h2><strong>Orange blossom panna cotta with strawberries</strong></h2> \n<p>The simplicity of panna cotta isn’t something to be messed with, but a drop or two of orange blossom water really works to bring out the delicacy of this dessert. Make sure you leave plenty of cooling and setting time in making these for a special meal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6648d474b29c12decac8cd6b3d75fdc2cbfa8a9f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434624146740/92d56901-7c72-4db9-bdb2-e80a302c9d95-460x303.jpeg\" alt=\"Panna cotta\" width=\"460\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orange-blossom panna cotta.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Makes 4</strong><br />3 leaves gelatine, cut into large pieces<br />300ml whole milk<br />90g caster sugar<br />Zest of 1 orange, coarsely grated<br />100ml single cream<br />Orange-blossom water, to taste<br />175g strawberries<br />30g caster sugar</p> \n<p>1 Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for 5 minutes or so, until softened. Meanwhile, heat the milk, sugar and orange zest until scalding hot.</p> \n<p>2 Drain the liquid from the gelatine pieces, then add the pieces to the hot milk mixture, whisking immediately to combine. Set back over a low heat and bring to the boil. As soon as the mixture starts to simmer, take it off the heat, stir in the single cream and add orange blossom water, to taste. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve to remove the orange zest.</p> \n<p>3 Lightly grease 4 individual 150ml pudding moulds or ramekins and divide the panna cotta mixture between them. Leave to cool to room temperature before placing in the fridge for a few hours to chill and set. I find it’s best to leave them overnight, but as long as you can spare2-3 hours of fridge time, you should be fine.</p> \n<p>4 Hull and quarter the strawberries, then toss them in a bowl with the caster sugar and a few more drops of orange-blossom water, to taste. Place in the fridge to macerate while the puddings set.</p> \n<p>5 To unmould the panna cotta, carefully dip the bottoms of each basin or ramekin in hot water for a few seconds before quickly inverting the pudding on to a plate. If the panna cotta sticks stubbornly in its mould, try running a small knife around the edge toor dipping into the hot water for a few moments more. Serve with the macerated strawberries.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434623412452/9a7fb191-af47-4f0e-9b05-14614d95a2d9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"A summery pineapple and camomile cake and an elegant orange-blossom panna cotta with strawberries.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434624197558/c775ed2d-c40f-4733-9309-9760900c303c-620x405.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":405,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ruby’s summery pineapple camomile cake.

But, if you’re planning an all-nighter on the longest day of the year, the recipes that follow make fabulous fourth meals and are guaranteed to satisfy both sweet and savoury cravings as the clock strikes midnight.</p> \n<p>If it’s your sweet tooth keeping you awake, try MarmadukeScarlet’s toasted apples, served with or without smoked cheese. Caramelise over a candle for something special.</p> \n<p>A dish that also straddles sweet and savoury is Charlene F’s bacon, banana and peanut butter pancakes – best made with an accomplice. The poutine from MizPepperpot is just the ticket if you’re the type to pop down the pub for a quick drink before dinner, and end up back home after closing time. Meanwhile, Fadime Tiskaya’s midnight chorizo melt is a one-frying-pan wonder.</p> \n<p>I’d happily stay awake for the chance to tuck in to any of these again, but I was won over by Bobby Ananta’s Indonesian noodle omelette. Lots of cheese and herbs mixed with noodles and eggs, then fried as a thick omelette. It calls for ready-made crispy onions or shallots – I defy you not to eat them by the fistful while you wait for the omelette to cook.</p> \n<h2><strong>The winning recipe: </strong><strong>Martabak mie</strong></h2> \n<p>If you want to add a spicy kick to this noodle omelette, combine tomato sauce and chilli sauce, or stir a finely chopped bird’s eye chilli into the egg mix. <br /><a href=\"http://bobbyananta.com/\"><em>Bobby Ananta</em></a><em>, Leicester</em><br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 1-2</strong><br />60g noodles (any type of noodles from your cupboard – even instant)<br />3 eggs <br />3 spring onions: 2 finely chopped for the mix, 1 roughly chopped to serve<br />1 small bunch of parsley, finely chopped<br />1 small bunch of basil leaves, finely chopped<br />&frac12; tbsp crunchy fried shallots <br />30g cheddar cheese, grated <br />30g parmesan cheese, grated <br />&frac12; tsp ground white pepper<br />&frac12; tsp ground black pepper<br />A pinch of salt<br />1 tbsp vegetable oil<br />Tomato sauce, chilli sauce or creme fraiche, to serve</p> \n<p>1 In a small pan of boiling water, cook the noodles following the packet instructions, but then leave to cook for a couple of minutes longer, so the noodles have softened a bit more. Drain, then leave to cool a little, or rinse under cold water.</p> \n<p>2 Gently beat the eggs in a mixing bowl, then add the finely chopped spring onions, half the parsley and basil and half the cheeses. Add the peppers and salt, then stir in the soft noodles and crunchy fried shallots.</p> \n<p>3 Heat the oil in the a frying pan. Fry the mixture until golden brown – about 3-4 minutes. If it feels firm enough to flip, try that, but if not, flash it under a hot grill until the top of the omelette is golden-brown. Serve with the rest of the spring onions, basil leaves, parsley and cheeses, and a dollop of tomato or chilli sauce or creme fraiche on the side, to taste.</p> \n<h2><strong>Apple and cheese sticks</strong></h2> \n<p>My late father, Henry, was a magical man. He seemed to make it his life’s mission to bring glee to the lives of all the children he met. This was his midnight feast: caramelised apples on toothpicks devoured with a sliced log of smoked Austrian cheese.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/MarmadukeScarlet\"><em>MarmadukeScarlet</em></a><em>, via </em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/556f09f1e4b0a46a322a5c77\"><em>GuardianWitness</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 1-2</strong><br />2 tbsp sugar<br />&frac12; tsp cinnamon<br />1 apple or pear<br />100ml orange juice<br />50g smoked Austrian cheese, sliced</p> \n<p>1 Combine the cinnamon and sugar, put the mix in a small bowl, then pour a small amount of orange juice into another bowl.</p> \n<p>2 Chop the apple into 8 pieces and thread each piece on to a skewer, then dip them into the orange juice and roll them in the sugar mixture.</p> \n<p>3 Light a candle and hold the apple over the flame, turning continuously. When it becomes golden-brown remove from the heat. Allow them to cool slightly, then eat with the cheese.</p> \n<h2><strong>Poutine with beef gravy and stilton</strong></h2> \n<p>A melting morass of loveliness – or chips, cheese ‘n’ gravy.
