The table would be covered with a linen cloth and napkins, which she had woven from linen she had spun 35 years previously, as part of her bottom drawer. To start she would bring a steaming bowl of stracciatelle soup, the broth made from a free-range chicken. To follow, the boiled chicken would be served with extra-virgin olive oil, freshly ground black pepper and home-cured black olives, ulive strinate, a speciality of the Marche region. The freshly picked black olives are put in a sack with sea salt and hung outside for 40 days in the frosty weather. To serve they are washed, dried and quickly fried in extra-virgin olive oil with crushed garlic, chilli flakes and zest of orange.</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 3<br /><strong>pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>fine fresh white breadcrumbs</strong> 4 tbsp<br /><strong>nutmeg</strong> freshly grated, a pinch<br /><strong>parmesan</strong> 4 tbsp, freshly grated<br /><strong>chicken stock</strong> 1&frac12; litres</p> \n<p>Beat the eggs in a bowl, add the remaining ingredients.

It’s a lovely way of celebrating good-quality basil, and for me is very much a summer dish. It makes a delicious first course or a one-plate meal, especially with the addition of French beans.</p> \n<p>Making pesto properly is another good case for slow food because it should ideally be made shortly before it is eaten. It is also one of the many recipes where you need to be very flexible in terms of quantities; tasting and adjusting them during preparation is a must.</p> \n<p>To my mind there is no substitute for pounding by hand, and I recommend using a marble pestle and mortar. Pesto made in a food processor tends to require extra olive oil and in my view, the machine is too harsh on the ingredients, making both the texture and flavour somewhat insipid.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>trenette or linguine</strong> 320-400g<br /><strong>basil leaves</strong> 4<br /><strong>french beans</strong> 200g, topped and tailed (optional)<br /><strong>pesto alla Genovese</strong> 8 tbsp (see below)<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano PDO</strong> 60g</p> \n<p>For the pesto<br /><strong>fresh basil</strong> 4 bunches, ideally PDO Genoese, good Proven&ccedil;al or home-grown outdoors<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 1-2, preferably Imperia from Vessalico, or French pink or violet varieties, such as ail rose de Lautrec<br /><strong>pine nuts </strong>30g<br /><strong>coarse sea salt </strong>10g, ideally sale di Cervia<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano cheese (aged 24 months)</strong> 30-40g, grated<br /><strong>fiore sardo (pecorino sardo) cheese </strong>40-50g, grated<br /><strong>PDO extra virgin olive oil from Liguria</strong> 50-70ml</p> \n<p>To make the pesto, wash the basil leaves in cold water and dry them on a tea towel but without rubbing. The following steps must be done as quickly as possible to avoid oxidation.</p> \n<p>Put the garlic and pine nuts in a mortar and pound with the pestle until smooth.</p> \n<p>Add a few grains of the salt and some of the basil leaves, then pound the mixture, using a light circular movement of the pestle against the sides of the mortar. Repeat this process until all the basil has been pounded.</p> \n<p>When the basil drips bright green liquid, add both cheeses and mix well. Pour a thin layer of the oil over the pesto and mix very lightly.</p> \n<p>Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling, well salted water until al dente. If you plan to add beans, put them in the water at the same time as the pasta. When ready, drain the pasta, then return it to the saucepan. Add 8 tablespoons of pesto and stir well so that the pasta is fully coated.</p> \n<p>Serve in pasta plates and place a basil leaf in the centre of each portion. Grate some parmigiano on top before eating.</p> \n<p><em>From Semplice by Dino Joannides (Preface Publishing, &pound;25). <a

you pickle a bowl of cherries they add a glorious sweet-and-sour kick to ham and fish dishes</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>Aside from a soft-crusted, sugar-dusted pie, there is little reason to cook a cherry. A jam, glowing jewel-like on the breakfast table, can be a fine thing if you have bothered to remove the stones; hell if you haven’t. But, other than that, cherries are best eaten from the bag or, better still, served cold, in a bowl of ice cubes that you have crushed to a near slush-puppy texture.</p> \n<p>An exception is a pickled cherry. A snap of sweet and sour to bring out the best in a slice of ham, a fillet of oily fish such as a tuna steak or a fillet of silver-skinned mackerel. When I say pickled, I don’t mean the fruit should be kept lurking in a jar of malt vinegar and spices for six months. I mean a quick 20-minute pickle, bright as a button, with star anise, black peppercorns, mild red wine and vinegar, and just enough sugar to stop your lips smarting.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week I simmered a ham in apple juice and served the amber broth with a dose of pickled cherries. The faintly salty cooking liquor and sour cherries were a perfect balance for the sweet, thick-cut meat and fat. An initial boiling in water prevented an over-salty broth. Skimming the surface regularly kept the juices clear and bright.</p> \n<p>The next day we ate the ham cold, cut thinner this time, with a spinach salad (dressing: cider vinegar, walnut oil, grain mustard, lemon juice) with more of the cherries and their juice. Afterwards, greedy for more of the pickled fruit, we ate thick yogurt sweetened with whipped cream, a pinch of sugar and the meanest seasoning of ground cinnamon. We then tipped a tiny spoonful of the cherries over the folds of creamy, spice-flecked yogurt.</p> \n<h2>Pickled cherries</h2> \n<p>I used dark, sweet dessert cherries for this. If you are using sour fruit, then add a little more sugar. Makes 500g of pickled cherries.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>cherries </strong>500g<strong> </strong><br /><strong>red-wine vinegar </strong>125ml<br /><strong>red wine</strong> 375ml<br /><strong>sugar </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>black peppercorns </strong>1 tsp<br /><strong>star anise </strong>2 whole<strong> </strong><br /></p> \n<p>Pull the cherries from their stalks, then halve each fruit and remove the stones. Put the stoned cherries into a stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan then pour in the vinegar and red wine and bring to the boil. Stir in the sugar, the peppercorns and the star anise then lower the heat so the liquid bubbles gently for 3 or 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the mixture to cool.</p> \n<h2>Grilled mackerel, pickled cherries and samphire</h2> \n<p>The sour pickling juice of the cherries does the work of lemon juice here, balancing the oily richness of the fish. A few spoonfuls over the hot fish are as important as the cherries themselves.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>mackerel fillets </strong>4<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>samphire </strong>2 handfuls<br /><strong>pickled cherries </strong>6 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>Check the mackerel fillets for any stray bones, then place them skin-side down on a lined grill pan. Brush them lightly with olive oil, then season with a little salt. Cook under an overhead grill or over the bars of a hot grill for four minutes on each side until lightly cooked through. (The advantage of cooking over a grill is that you will have crisp skin, too, but an overhead grill works well enough.)</p> \n<p>Rinse the samphire in cold running water and trim any tough roots. Put the samphire in a bowl and add the cherries and their juices. Toss the cherries and samphire and leave for a few minutes while the mackerel cooks. Place a bed of samphire and cherries on two plates, spoon over the cherry pickling liquor, then place a couple of fillets on each. Spoon over a little more pickling liquor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dcc71522b93afbfb41333d5575e4833d8d7d40b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661454346/430168d5-e760-48e1-bd70-2e071f686d58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Slater's gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe on a round plate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: Nigel Slater’s gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe.

Do this twice if you fear your ham is on the salty side. Serves 4<br /></p> \n<p><strong>ham or gammon joint </strong>1.5kg, rolled and tied<br /><strong>water </strong>1 litre<br /><strong>apple juice </strong>1 litre<br /><strong>bay leaves </strong>2<br /><strong>peppercorns </strong>10<br /><strong>cloves </strong>4<br /></p> \n<p>To finish<br /><strong>cooking liquor </strong>from the ham <br /><strong>pickled cherries </strong>12 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>Put the piece of gammon in a large, deep pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat so the water doesn’t boil over, and leave to cook for 20 minutes.</p> \n<p>Carefully pour the water away and return the pan to the heat. Pour in the litre of water and the apple juice, then tuck in the bay leaves. Add the peppercorns and cloves and bring to the boil. If any froth comes to the surface, remove it with a draining spoon. When every bit of froth has been removed and the liquid is clear, lower the heat so it bubbles gently, then partially cover with a lid.</p> \n<p>Let the gammon cook for about 60-90 minutes, checking the liquid level from time to time and turning the meat carefully once or twice to ensure even cooking. Switch off the heat but leave the meat in the cooking liquor.</p> \n<p>Lift the meat out and place it on a carving board. Taste the cooking liquid, correct the seasoning if necessary. Carve the meat into thick slices and put two or three per person into shallow dishes or deep plates. Ladle some of the cooking broth over each then add 2 or 3 tablespoons of pickled cherries and some of their liquid over each.

Here are some combinations we’ve been enjoying recently.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Inspired by Hemsley and Hemsley’s delicious quinoa risotto in <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/art-of-eating-well.html\">The Art of Eating Well</a>, we have been making batches of our own versions to take to work the next day– quinoa seems to hold its texture well and doesn’t go sloppy. Make some chicken or veg stock, then gradually add to a pan of quinoa and onion that’s been quickly fried in olive oil. Go green by adding lots of seasonal asparagus and broad beans, with tarragon, lemon juice and a cheeky grating of pecorino; or go red with halved cherry tomatoes; peppers, and red onion with a splash of white wine and some basil.<br /></p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Make some zingy couscous salads with avocado, feta, lime, cucumber, red onion and whole almonds. Fresh herbs are obviously a great addition, but if you don’t have any to hand, just make sure to add plenty of olive oil and lemon juiceand to your salads. Sliced olives or pomegranate seeds will add plenty of contrasting zing.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Barley is a grateful recipient of leftovers and revitalised fridge lurkers. Roast some red onion, peppers and carrot with honey and garlic until caramelised, then stir into cooked barley while warm. Other great combinations are is green beans saut&eacute;ed in butter and garlic, or flaked mackerel with cherry tomatoes.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Bulgur is also an excellent and filling base, working well to soak up the lovely rich juices produced from roasting veg. Tomatoes and peppers work especially well: just roast with olive oil, salt, pepper and a little thyme until caramelised, then mixed into your cooked bulgur (cook in boiling water for around 15 minutes, or until done). Alternatively, add frozen peas to your just-cooked bulgur (the residual heat will thaw them, so no need to cook) and a dressing of grated ginger, olive oil, a tiny splash of sesame oil, a more generous splash of soy sauce and lots of lime juice.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Sometimes it can be hard to hit your five-a-day: if you want every bit of your lunch to count towards your veg quota then you can fake it to make it. It’s not a grain, but if you roughly chop a cauliflower, then whizz it up in a food processor, it will sort of resemble one (credit and thanks to the genius Felicity Cloake for this idea). Fry your cauliflower ‘grains’ in a little olive oil until softened. You could do this with broccoli, or romanesco, too. Season and add lemon zest to taste. Top with a generous portion of spinach (or other seasonal greens), saut&eacute;ed with olive oil and sliced garlic, and a dollop of yoghurt or creme fraiche. A small sprinkling of chilli flakes or a squidge of chilli sauce would give a nice little kick as a finishing touch.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435838258847/695faecf-ac8c-454d-aead-eaccc88b5272-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Hennie Haworth for the Guardian","altText":"Grains: an illustration of some, in a bowl.

Get flash with your florets and turn them into spicy patties, a substantial salad, speedy nasi goreng and warm cheesy bake</p>","byline":"Rosie Reynolds","body":"<p>Creamy cauliflower florets are the perfect vehicle for batch cooking for three good reasons. First, they can take the weight of strong, punchy flavours. As the cauliflower cooks, the florets open up ever so slightly exposing yet more surface area for spices and sauces to get into. Second, the texture of cauliflower is so variable: you can keep your florets charred and crisp in salads, or yielding and comforting when slathered in cheese sauce. And third, it helps that cauliflowers are often the size of a football, so unless you’re feeding a crowd, you will have plenty of leftovers for the week ahead. Here are are four of my favourite ways to transform said football into winning weeknight recipes.</p> \n<p><strong>To cook the batch of cauliflower</strong><br />2 medium cauliflowers (about 1300g) <br />1 Break the cauliflower into florets and discard the base of the stem. Trim away the tough outer leaves, reserving the smaller ones surrounding the head. Part boil the florets in salted water for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and allow to steam dry for a few minutes, then tip on to kitchen paper or a clean tea towel.</p> \n<h2><strong>The tangy salad</strong><strong>: Cauliflower, sultana and pine nut salad with garlic yoghurt</strong><strong> (pictured above)</strong></h2> \n<p>This has to be my favourite way to eat cauliflower: the deeply savoury florets, crisp and charred at the edges, work amazingly with the plump, sweet sultanas.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 2-4</strong><br />400g cooked cauliflower and leaves<br />2 tbsp olive oil <br />1 red onion, cut into wedges <br />&frac12; tsp chilli flakes <br />75g sultanas <br />40g pine nuts <br />100g baby spinach leaves <br /><strong> </strong></p> \n<p><strong>For the garlic yoghurt </strong><br />200g Greek yoghurt <br />1 garlic clove, crushed <br />Juice of 1 lemon <br />Salt and black pepper</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Put the cauliflower on a large baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, stir, then add the onion wedges, chilli flakes and cauliflower leaves to the tray. Roast for another 25 minutes. Five minutes from the end, add the sultanas and pine nuts and continue cooking.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Meanwhile, mix all the ingredients for the garlic yoghurt together with some seasoning and set aside.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Remove the cauliflower from the oven, allow to cool to room temperature then toss with the spinach leaves. Serve with the garlic yoghurt.</p> \n<h2><strong>The weeknight supper</strong><strong>: Cauliflower and mackerel nasi goreng</strong></h2> \n<p>The perfect weeknight food fix, this bowlful can be on the table in less than 20 minutes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad4b09d5cec7a6a3b29a2c1487d896d3c4c15759\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435833262336/5056bb7f-8bd6-43b2-93b7-c59c25d02696-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"nasi goreng\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This fried rice dish will keep you full all evening and any leftovers can be packed up for lunch. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Serves 4 </strong><br />2 eggs, lightly beaten <br />1 garlic clove, crushed <br />4cm-piece ginger, peeled and grated<br />2 tbsp vegetable oil<br />1&frac12; tbsp nasi goreng paste<br />400g cooked cauliflower and leaves, roughly chopped <br />1 red chilli, chopped <br />6 spring onions, sliced <br />400g cooked rice <br />2 smoked mackerel fillets, flaked<br />1 tbsp light soy sauce<br />A small bunch of coriander, chopped<br />Salt and black pepper <br /></p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Mix the egg, garlic and ginger with some seasoning.

And I can think of no better summer lunch dish than this, served with big bowls of summery veg. (You’ll need to start on the rabbit legs a day ahead; it’s all of five minutes’ extra work, but if you can’t face it, buy a big jar or tin of confit duck instead, though it won’t be quite the same.) There should be a gluggable red wine on the table, too, with a little chill on it. And lunch should go on – calmly – for hours. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>4 rabbit hind legs<br />Sea salt and black pepper<br />3 or 4 sprigs fresh thyme<br />Duck, goose or pork fat<br />Chicken and rabbit bones (or just chicken), with stock vegetables of your choice (leek, carrot, turnip, perhaps)<br />12 shallots, peeled but left whole<br />12 small turnips (if possible with tops, cut off but reserved)<br />12 baby carrots, green tops trimmed off</strong></p> \n<p><strong><br /></strong>For the a&iuml;oli<br /><strong>20 garlic cloves <br />Sea salt and black pepper<br />2 free-range egg yolks<br />At least 300ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />Juice of 2 lemons (you may not need it all, but it’s best to have it to hand)</strong></p> \n<p>First, confit the rabbit. In a plastic, glass or china container, scantily scatter salt, pepper and a couple of sprigs of thyme. Lay in the rabbit legs in a single layer and scatter more salt, pepper and thyme on top. Cover, then refrigerate for 24 hours.</p> \n<p>The next day, there should be a salty puddle in your container. Remove the legs and brush off any salt, pepper and thyme. Dry the legs with a clean towel, place in an oven dish or pan and add enough duck, goose or pork fat (or a combination) to submerge the legs. Cover with foil and cook in a medium oven until the flesh is giving but not falling apart – about two hours. Transfer the meat to a sealable glass, plastic or china container, then pour over the fat to cover. You can make this confit far in advance, in which case seal the container, leave it to cool, then refrigerate. Either way, make sure the legs are at room temperature before cooking them further.</p> \n<p>Make a stock with rabbit and/or chicken bones and the vegetables. Meanwhile, make the a&iuml;oli. Put the garlic in the chopping bowl of a food processor with a pinch of salt (this helps to break it up) and pepper, then whizz until finely pulped – this is important, because you do not want garlic chippings in the a&iuml;oli. With the motor running, add the egg yolks, let them meet the garlic for a moment, then slowly add the oil in a gentle stream. The emulsion should safely hold up to 300ml oil; at that point, take a view and, if you can, add a little more oil. Add lemon juice, tasting as you go, adjust the seasoning and refrigerate.</p> \n<p>Strain the stock into a pan, then bring to a boil and add the shallots. Cook for 10 minutes, then add the rest of the vegetables except the turnip tops. Cook for eight minutes, then reduce the broth to a gentle simmer. Lift the rabbit legs from their fat and use your fingers to scrape off any excess. Add the legs to the pot and let them gently heat through and soften. When they are hot and the vegetables are cooked, stir in the turnip greens and wait for them to wilt. Season to taste, then ladle into deep plates or shallow bowls, so a ladle of broth can be poured over each serving. Eat with the a&iuml;oli.</p> \n<p> <span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Fergus Henderson is chef/patron of <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com\">St John</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/spitalfields/\">St John Bread &amp; Wine</a>, both in London.</p> \n<p><strong>Fiona Beckett’s wine match </strong>Fergus is a bit of a Francophile, so I’m sticking with French wine here.

Food styling: Cara Hobday</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the kind of dish I’d make for a family lunch in Italy, particularly if we were in Sicily, where the red mullet is so good. I’d serve it with a bottle of <a href=\"http://www.planeta.it/en/schede_vino/cometa-doc-sicilia-fiano/\">Cometa</a>, from the Planeta winery, which would assist in my rejuvenating siesta afterwards. The dish is a little involved, true, but it’s worth the effort: the end result is as impressive to look at as it is to eat. If you buy whole fish and ask the fishmonger to fillet them for you, you should keep the bones for the stock (this will give the dish a more intense flavour) and the liver (to beat in right at the end, to enrich the dish); if you can get only fillets, just omit those two extra steps in the method – it’ll still be very tasty. As for the pasta, I’d use garganelli, which can be hard to come by in the UK; casarecce make a good substitute. Any self-respecting Italian would serve this as a separate pasta course, after some antipasti and before a simple whole fish; but hell, it’s summer, so there’s no harm in serving it as a main, perhaps with a green bean, roasted red onion and parmesan salad. Serves four, or six as a starter.</p> \n<p><strong>20g unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />4 small or 2 large red mullet fillets (if possible, ask your fishmonger for the head, bones and liver)<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />400g garganelli or casarecce<br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br />&frac12; glass white wine<br />4 tomatoes, blanched, skinned, deseeded and cut into eighths<br />3 tbsp good black olives, such as taggiasche, pitted<br />4 tbsp passata<br />1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, picked and finely chopped (use the stalks in the stock)</strong></p> \n<p>For the stock<br /><strong>1 tbsp olive oil<br />&frac12; carrot, peeled and cut into chunks<br />&frac12; onion, peeled and cut into chunks<br />1 celery stalk, cut into chunks<br />1 bay leaf<br />2 black peppercorns<br />Mullet heads and bones<br />&frac12; glass white wine <br />&frac12; tbsp tomato paste</strong></p> \n<p>First make the stock. Heat the oil in a pan, add the vegetables, bay leaf, peppercorns and parsley stalks, and sweat for a couple of minutes to soften, but not colour. Add the fish heads and bones and sweat until they start to stick to the base of the pan. Add the wine, leave to bubble until the alcohol has evaporated, then stir in the tomato paste and cook on a low heat for two minutes, taking care that the paste doesn’t burn. Add a little water – enough almost to cover, but not quite – bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Pass through a fine sieve.</p> \n<p>If you’ve got the mullet liver, mash it, preferably with a pestle and mortar, though the back of a knife will do, then put in a bowl with the butter and mix until a uniform pink.</p> \n<p>Cut the fish fillets into strips and bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, ready for the pasta.</p> \n<p>Heat half the oil in a large saute pan. The idea is to cook the garlic (so that it is digestible) but not burn it (or it will be bitter), so here’s a cheffy trick: tilt the pan, making the oil flow to one side, and sweat the garlic gently in that for a few minutes, until it starts to colour – it’s far less likely to burn this way. Meanwhile, put the pasta on to cook.</p> \n<p>Add the mullet to the garlic pan (you can stop tilting now) and cook for a minute or two, until it starts to stick to the pan. Scrape it away and it will flake and crumble. Add the wine and about half a ladle of stock (save the rest for another day), leave it to bubble and reduce for a minute, then stir in the fresh tomato and olives. Mix in the passata and cook gently for two to three minutes more.</p> \n<p>Drain the pasta when it’s been boiling for a minute less than the time stated on the packet (ie, after five or six minutes): it needs to be drained well, almost dry, or it won’t take up the liver butter. Reserve some of the cooking water – in Italy, this is what we use to bring pasta sauces together. Add the pasta to the mullet pan, toss in the rest of the olive oil and, just before serving, beat in the liver butter with a wooden spoon; if need be, loosen with a little reserved cooking water. Scatter the chopped parsley on top, and serve.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Giorgio Locatelli is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.locandalocatelli.com\">Locanda Locatelli</a> in London.</p> \n<p><strong>Fiona Beckett’s wine match </strong>If you want to follow Giorgio’s advice and drink Planeta’s lush <strong>Cometa</strong>, <a href=\"http://www.carluccios.com/shop-online/italian-wine-spirits/cometa-planeta\">you can buy it from Carluccio’s for &pound;19.50 </a>(go to <a href=\"http://www.wine-searcher.com/find/planeta+cometa/1/uk\">wine-searcher.com</a> for other stockists).

I love getting together with friends and family in the garden, and serving up big bowls of exciting salads that everybody can get stuck into. This is one of my favourites. The candied aubergine puree is not at all difficult, but just leave it out if it’s not your thing. Serves four.</p> \n<p>For the marinated aubergine<strong><br />2 aubergines, peeled in alternating 2cm-wide strips, so they end up with purple and white stripes (ie, a bit like zebra skin), then cut into 2cm dice<br />15ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />100ml passata<br />40ml honey<br />40ml moscatel vinegar<br />40ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 spring onions, finely sliced<br />4 sprigs coriander, chopped<br />4 sprigs mint, leaves picked finely and chopped (do this just before you need them, otherwise they’ll blacken)<br />Salt</strong></p> \n<p>For the candied aubergine puree <br /><strong>2 aubergines, peeled, cut into 2cm dice<br />1 lemon, juiced<br />30g caster sugar<br />20ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />50ml double cream</strong></p> \n<p>For the salad<br /><strong>4 chicory leaves<br />4 radicchio leaves<br />&frac12; bunch watercress<br />4 tsp Greek yoghurt<br />40g almond flakes, gently toasted (or, even better, smoked almonds, lightly crushed, to add another layer of flavour – I get mine from <a href=\"http://www.brindisa.com/store/nuts-and-olives/all-nuts-and-olives/salted-marcona-almonds-1kg/\">Brindisa</a>, but they are also available online)</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Toss the diced aubergine for the marinade in the olive oil, then lay out on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper and bake for around 15 minutes, or until cooked through with just a touch of colour. Turn down the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, ready for the puree (if making). Leave the cooked aubergine to cool, then combine with all the other ingredients and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least four hours, and preferably overnight.</p> \n<p>To make the puree, combine all the ingredients except the cream and spread over a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Bake for about 25 minutes, until completely soft and with a little colour. While the mix is still hot, tip into a blender, add the cream and blitz smooth. Season to taste and set aside.</p> \n<p>To serve, spread a spoonful of puree on each plate (or put it all on one big platter; or on individual slices of toasted sourdough, a bit like bruschetta, and serve as part of a meze). Divide the leaves and the marinated aubergine between the plates. Place a few dots of yoghurt on all of them, scatter over a sprinkling of almonds, and serve.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Selin Kiazim’s restaurant <a href=\"http://www.oklava.co.uk\">Oklava</a> opens in London this autumn.</p> \n<p><strong>Fiona Beckett’s wine matches </strong>Respecting Selin’s Turkish-Cypriot heritage, you could go for a brambly Turkish red with this exotic dish – <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/anfora-trio-case-of-6/p/p60033143?OmnitureRedirect=anfora+trio\"><strong>Anfora Trio 2013</strong></a> (&pound;8, Marks &amp; Spencer; 14% abv) would do the trick.

Whether you need a wee sip or a punch for a party, there is something here for everyone, from twists on old classics to super-trashy delights. You’ll need barely any equipment to make any of them. If you have a shaker, great, but really a pint glass will do, and a rolling pin makes a great substitute for a professional bartender’s muddler.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rum and raisin old-fashioned</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2c02c895221437fef9df775873b73e956e28142d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435672736441/111add39-df15-49bb-bc43-535c5fcbc425-311x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Rum\" width=\"311\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>No raisins were harmed in the making of this cocktail – it’s the <a href=\"http://www.harveyshalfhour.co.uk/harveys-sherry\">Harvey’s Bristol Cream</a> that brings the raisiny flavour. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml Appleton VX rum<br />25ml Harvey’s Bristol Cream<br />1 dash Angostura bitters <br />1 dash Angostura orange bitters<br />1 orange twist, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a tumbler or rocks glass with ice cubes. Add the rum, sherry and bitters, and stir. Gently squeeze the oils from the orange peel on to the surface of the drink, then drop into the glass and serve.</p> \n<h2><strong>Apricot julep</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0992f903d57d1d0078a28b813b3b8bb0adccdafd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435672845483/5ac49fa0-d340-4185-9bca-b4a53ae4086d-460x406.jpeg\" alt=\"Apricot\" width=\"460\" height=\"406\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Mint julep is the official drink of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/kentucky-derby\">the Kentucky Derby</a>, where thousands are consumed over the two-day event. Closer to home, David Gerran, bar manager of <a href=\"http://thewhipmayfair.co.uk\">The Whip in Mayfair</a>, has mixed this twist on the julep for me on many occasions, and I’ve coaxed the recipe from his chilled, minty fingers. The key to a great julep is in the careful handling of the mint. These drinks were originally served in pewter tins, but if you don’t have one, a tin camping mug works just fine (or, provided it’s got no sharp edges, the empty tin your apricots were in). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>1 tin apricots – you’ll need 25ml tinned juice for each serving<br />8 mint leaves, plus 1 extra to serve<br />50ml bourbon</strong></p> \n<p>Drain the apricots, saving the juice in a jug (eat the fruit separately – I like them with thick cream or ice-cream, which reminds me a bit of school dinners). Put the mint leaves in the empty tin, then squish into the sides and base of the tin with the back of a spoon: you want to impart a minty flavour over as much of the walls of the tin as you can. Pour in the bourbon, then fill the tin with crushed ice. Pour 25ml tinned apricot juice over the ice, and garnish with fresh mint. Sip slowly.</p> \n<h2><strong>Common or garden G&amp;T</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8fbf80f8a4c173c563efdd1d6ef50bf7aaad820\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673613123/33654967-82e7-44b5-899c-45c3a92b4358-193x420.jpeg\" alt=\"G&amp;T\" width=\"193\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Best drunk propped up on one elbow while lying on a lawn. The bay and sage should be easy to find or “forage” from a park or neighbour’s garden. Gnome optional. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>35ml gin (<a href=\"http://www.sipsmith.com\">Sipsmith’s</a>, for preference)<br />Tonic water (<a href=\"http://www.fever-tree.com\">Fever-Tree</a>, for preference)<br />1 fresh bay leaf<br />1 sage leaf<br />1 lemon wedge</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a large wine glass with ice cubes. Add the gin, top with tonic to taste, and add the bay and sage. Squeeze over the lemon wedge, then drop it into the glass, stir and sip.</p> \n<h2><strong>Vodka martinez</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"90725c112439f0ca68c1d3ffc265175596eae2c8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673023091/2722c33e-5c86-455c-a492-78cea9012b46-205x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Vodka Martinez\" width=\"205\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>The martinez is the father of the martini. Brian Silva of <a href=\"http://balthazarlondon.com\">Balthazar in Covent Garden</a> has mixed one for me more times than I care to remember (or should that be am able to remember?). He uses vodka instead of the gin, and I haven’t looked back since my first sip. The vodka isn’t as domineering, so the aromatics in the vermouth are free to play. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml sweet vermouth<br />15ml vodka <br />4 drops maraschino<br />1 lemon twist</strong></p> \n<p>Chill a sherry glass or coupe. Put the vermouth, vodka and maraschino in a shaker, add ice and stir until chilled. Strain into the glass, squeeze the lemon twist over the drink and discard the lemon. Sip away.</p> \n<h2><strong>Somerset appletini</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"05392f5fcb1bbf4182443a39879715f73298c7de\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673077346/8c0a63b6-d06f-4c50-a3a0-99a4c51b9b08-333x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Somerset appletini\" width=\"333\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A Somerset take on the martini, though it actually has very little incommon with that sweet cocktail. The apple part is purely a reference to the eau du vie made by <a href=\"http://www.ciderbrandy.co.uk\">Cider Brandy God Julian Temperley</a>. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>35ml Somerset apple eau du vie<br />15ml Noilly Pratt<br />1 lemon twist</strong></p> \n<p>Chill a coupe glass. Combine the eau du vie and vermouth in a shaker, stir until chilled, then double strain into the glass. Squeeze the lemon twist over the drink and drop into the glass.</p> \n<h2><strong>Michelada</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aea3449666079ae212cf87e0770e68cceea9eaf8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673125275/0443b2fa-87e0-4a2f-9348-4ed0d2e7c000-319x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Michelada\" width=\"319\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>West Country meets Mexico in this gorgeous summer drink. Trust me on this one: the combination of tomato, spice, salt, acidity and beer is brilliant. Also great served as a small shot alongside a healthy measure of good tequila (in Mexico, this is known as sangrita). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml tomato juice<br />25ml apple juice<br />Juice of &frac12; lime <br />1 tsp chipotle paste<br />1 dash <a href=\"http://www.cholula.com\">Cholula sauce</a><br />1 lime wedge <br />Sea salt, for the rim<br />Chapel Down’s <a href=\"http://www.chapeldown.com/curious-brew\">Curious Brew lager</a> (or any other good British lager)</strong></p> \n<p>Mix all of the ingredients except the beer. Roll the rim of a highball or half-pint glass in coarse sea salt and fill with ice. Pour in the mix, add the lime wedge and top with beer. Make more immediately.</p> \n<h2><strong>White Russian</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"705627e82a039d28bf4ae49919f2b9b0d2d22d6f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673199191/ed7bfad6-d294-4c16-9fcc-3723abd7420e-240x420.jpeg\" alt=\"White Russian\" width=\"240\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This simple cocktail gives the drinker a white moustache. Made famous by <a href=\"http://\">the Dude in The Big Lebowski</a>, white Russian has a creamy texture, obviously, and a sweet, boozy finish. I like to use <a href=\"http://www.blackcow.co.uk\">Black Cow vodka</a> here: it’s distilled from milk, so seems very fitting, plus it’s made in Dorset. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml Black Cow vodka<br />25ml Kahlua <br />25ml cream<br />Swizzle stick, to serve</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a tumbler with cubed ice. Add the vodka and Kahlua, and stir. Carefully pour on the cream – you want it to stay on top in a distinct layer – and serve with a swizzle stick.</p> \n<h2><strong>Strawberry, lemonade and mint</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"75c1b8e25d410e682e6ba8fd1c794ec8f85d9de7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673246934/c4694a0f-49ab-4a7b-b6fa-d25369b89498-202x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Strawberry cocktail\" width=\"202\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A thirst-quenching number with an almost sherbety finish for any alcohol-abstainers at your gathering (and also rather splendid dosed with a shot of vodka or gin). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>3 strawberries<br />125ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans Victorian lemonade</a> (or other cloudy lemonade)<br />1 small handful fresh mint<br />1 sprig fresh mint and 1 strawberry, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Put three strawberries in the base of a highball glass and muddle (ie, bash) until smooth. Add the handful of mint, gently muddle again, then top with lemonade and stir to mix. Top with ice and garnish with a sprig of mint and a whole strawberry.</p> \n<h2><strong>Honey sazerac</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"db6c3db5228d69d622a36e7cd6aa43edf2650ff8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673310086/deaae14e-aba0-4ae3-9f1c-567af9b10474-257x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Honey\" width=\"257\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A strong drop that makes a superb closer to an evening. I’ve used honey rather than the more usual sugar, because I find that gives a smoother finish; the dash of absinthe leaves a heady, aniseed coating on the glass. If you’re making a batch, serve from a jug with lots of ice, and sip from a set of chilled small cups or shot glasses. Sometimes drinking from tiny vessels gives a very different perspective on life. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>1 dash absinthe<br />50ml rye whisky<br />1 tsp honey<br />3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters<br />1 dash Angostura bitters <br />Lemon twist, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Swirl the absinthe and a little ice around your chosen drinking vessels. Put the whisky, honey and both bitters in a shaker, and stir to dissolve the honey. Add ice and stir again for 30 seconds. Tip out the ice and absinthe from the glasses (or drink it: no one’s watching) and fill with fresh ice. Strain the shaker into two glasses, squeeze a lemon twist over each drink and drop in.</p> \n<h2><strong>Storm in a teacup</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"589f2c30e7635eeeec63ec2b7672eb0e4a47c3ca\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673359286/6a9faf01-04fd-4332-a896-556fb6512bfa-291x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Storm in teacup\" width=\"291\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This is essentially a dark’n’stormy served in a teacup: a perfect way to disguise daytime drinking. If anyone asks, it’s darjeeling. The rosemary adds a savoury, herbal note. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>100ml <a href=\"http://www.goslingsrum.com\">Gosling’s rum</a> <br />25ml lime juice<br />250ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans ginger beer</a><br />2 slices fresh lime<br />2 rosemary sprigs</strong></p> \n<p>Combine the rum, lime juice and ginger beer in a teapot with plenty of ice, and stir. Pour into teacups (saucers obligatory), and garnish with a slice of lime and a rosemary sprig.</p> \n<h2><strong>Marmalade punch</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bb11d732fcba6581bfd63e6514c1055bb4a3e8ba\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673403359/4ff25856-5ffd-4a88-b206-c4b5bfd67ff1-348x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Marmalade\" width=\"348\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Just the ticket for a summer party: it has a gentle heat, and the whisky, orange and ginger are all fitting companions. The overarching flavour is one of marmalade. If Paddington Bear were old enough to drink, and also not a bear, this would be his drink of choice. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>500ml cloudy apple juice<br />250ml Fentimans ginger beer <br />100ml whisky<br />2 dashes Angostura orange bitters<br />Juice of &frac12; lemon <br />8 slices orange</strong></p> \n<p>Put everything bar four slices of orange into a large jar or jug with lots of ice. Stir, pour into tankards, peg an orange slice to the side of each and swig. Dead posh, this.</p> \n<h2><strong>White sangria</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"86777cef50044ecf7b58438b0e38217cde1e36dd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673489268/5a77e0ab-c253-4730-afef-d510dc8b04de-285x420.jpeg\" alt=\"white sangria\" width=\"285\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A gorgeous, fruity number in which the basil draws the drink towards a more aromatic and savoury conclusion. Thoroughly grown-up. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>6 strawberries<br />30g sugar<br />1 750ml bottle sauvignon blanc<br />Juice from 1 lemon<br />1 small apple, sliced<br />1 small handful fresh basil leaves</strong></p> \n<p>An hour ahead, cut the strawberries in half and sprinkle with sugar: the sugar will draw out flavour and form a syrup. Combine everything in a large jug, making sure to scrape in all the sugary strawberry juice, top with ice and stir. Serve in chilled tumblers or rocks glasses.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackabevan\">Jack Adair Bevan</a> is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.theethicurean.com\">The Ethicurean in Bristol</a>.

aren’t about spending hours at a hot stove; they should be planned to give you the space to catch up with friends and family, gossip and kick back. Much of the work involved in this summery menu can be done in advance. All you have to do when your guests turn up is chuck a couple of ingredients on the barbecue and toss together a salad. That leaves you plenty of time to enjoy being outside as much as possible. Have fun.</p> \n<h2><strong>Grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7431b8da468f23e6cbdd701b01b8b697042df51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435682683820/a9176f92-f820-4d11-bbbe-7c605c8a9775-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds: ‘A perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Halloumi is a wonder ingredient, and at its best when introduced to some heat, ideally flame. Here, slices of halloumi are whipped straight from the barbecue to the platter (it doesn’t do sitting around very well), then tossed with juicy peaches, wafer-thin ribbons of courgette and almonds fried in butter. It’s a perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors. Serves six to eight.</p> \n<p><strong>6 small courgettes<br />4 peaches, peeled, stoned and cut into thickish wedges<br />1 big handful mint leaves, roughly chopped<br />Juice of 1 large lemon<br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />20g butter<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />50g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped<br />&frac14; tsp paprika <br />500g halloumi, cut into 1cm-thick slices</strong></p> \n<p>Light the barbecue an hour before you want to eat (failing that, use a griddle pan). Peel the courgettes into long, thin strips with a vegetable peeler, rotating them as you do so and stopping before you get to the seedy centre (keep the middles for stewing in olive oil for a soup or side dish the next day). Put the ribbons in a salad bowl with the peach wedges, mint, lemon juice and three tablespoons of oil, toss gently but thoroughly and set aside.</p> \n<p>Put a small frying pan on a medium heat, add the butter and season generously. Swirling the pan constantly, melt the butter and cook for two to three minutes, until it starts darkening. Add the chopped almonds and paprika, cook for another minute or two, until the butter is a dark, biscuity colour and the almonds are golden, then scatter over the salad.</p> \n<p>Rub the slices of halloumi in the remaining tablespoon of oil, then lay on the hottest part of the barbecue (or on a heated griddle pan). Grill for 30-60 seconds on each side, until char marks appear and the cheese softens. Cut each halloumi slice in half, toss into the salad and taste: you may want a scrunch of black pepper, a sprinkling of sea salt, a squeeze more lemon or a touch more olive oil. Adjust accordingly and serve at once.</p> \n<p><strong>Barbecued rabbit (or chicken) with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f5933327bd4f4f84001da3641c975c1790570dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683145236/ea3b7813-2416-484d-a2aa-b7db15f5dcfc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli: ‘Sensational.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve used free-range farmed rabbit here, which is really tender and tasty, but skin-on chicken thighs or even a whole spatchcocked chicken will work just as well. The combination of the black, herby rub, sweet tomatoes and garlicky mayonnaise is sensational. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>3 bunches fresh thyme, 1 bunch picked and finely chopped<br />1 bunch fresh mint<br />5 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped <br />Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 farmed rabbits, jointed into 8 pieces (or chicken thighs)<br />80ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 punnets cherry tomatoes, halved<br />A few splashes red-wine vinegar </strong></p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli<br /><strong>2 egg yolks<br />1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed to a paste with a little salt<br />1 tsp Dijon mustard<br />750ml mild olive oil <br />Juice of &frac12; lemon</strong></p> \n<p>Put the barbecue on about an hour before you want to eat. Put two dry frying pans on a medium-high heat and divide between them two of the bunches of thyme and the mint. Dry-toast the herbs, shaking the pan every so often, until they have blackened and the room is smelling fragrant – about 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Put two-thirds of the garlic, the chopped thyme and a big pinch of salt in a mortar and bash with a pestle until you have a green paste (or use a food mixer). Pull the leaves from the burnt herbs, add these to the mortar and bash again until broken down and thoroughly mixed in. You should now have a blackish rub. Season generously, transfer to a large bowl and mix in the lemon zest. Add the rabbit pieces and rub them all over with the marinade.</p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli, put the egg yolks, garlic, mustard and a generous pinch of salt into a food processor and blitz briefly. With the motor running, very slowly drip the oil through the funnel of the processor, until the mayonnaise starts to thicken and emulsify, then pour in the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream. Loosen with lemon juice and a few tablespoons of water, season to taste and transfer to a bowl.</p> \n<p>Put the oil and the rest of the garlic in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Once the garlic begins to bubble in the oil, cook for a minute or two to soften, then stir in the tomatoes and season generously. Cover with a lid, turn the heat right down and poach gently for 10 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened. Season with the vinegar to taste, and set aside.</p> \n<p>Once the barbecue is ready (ie, when you can hold your hand over the coals for only about five seconds before it gets too hot for comfort), put the rabbit legs and shoulders on the grill. After five minutes, add the belly pieces and, five minutes later, the ribs and saddle. Turn the pieces frequently until charred all over, brushing them with any leftover marinade as they cook – it should take 15-20 minutes from start to finish. (To check that the meat is done, cut into a thick piece.) Pile the cooked rabbit on to a large plate, squeeze over some lemon juice, then spoon on the juicy tomatoes, followed by the a&iuml;oli. Serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26d235d0cb1ebf1d305499af9aa58c0efbe7239d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435744594796/393c318f-2ca4-4d4d-9391-486a1afcee3f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: 'Low in gluten.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: ‘Low in gluten.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This delicious cocoa-rye pastry comes from <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tartine-2.html\">Chad Robertson’s amazing book Tartine 3</a> (&pound;24.99, Chronicle Books). It gives the sweet cardamom custard a crisp, grown-up, dark chocolate edge. It’s also very low in gluten. Serve with a bowl of fresh raspberries alongside. You’ll need a 26cm tart tin. Serves 12-16.</p> \n<p>For the cocoa-rye pastry<strong><br />500g unsalted butter<br />200g caster sugar<br />1 large egg plus 1 yolk, at room temperature<br />&frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />280g rye flour, sifted<br />170g cocoa powder, sifted, plus extra for dusting</strong></p> \n<p>For the cardamom custard<strong><br />350ml whole milk<br />350ml double cream<br />6 cardamom pods, seeds crushed<br />Seeds from 1 vanilla pod<br />10 egg yolks<br />120g caster sugar</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. To make the pastry, beat the butter and sugar with a paddle mixer until soft and a pale cream colour – this will take a few minutes. Beat in the whole egg, then the yolk, and stop the mixer. Scrape down the sides and beat in the vanilla, followed by the flour and cocoa, until thoroughly combined. Transfer the pastry to a large piece of clingfilm, pat into a rectangle and refrigerate for at least an hour, until firm.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the custard. Put the milk, cream, cardamom, vanilla seeds and pod into a saucepan and bring to simmering point. Simmer gently for three minutes, then set aside for 10 minutes to infuse. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, until light and pale. Discard the vanilla pod, then whisk the warm milk into the eggs and pour into a jug.</p> \n<p>Divide the dough in two and freeze half for another day. Dust both sides of the remaining dough lightly with cocoa powder and roll out between two large pieces of baking paper or clingflim, rotating as you do, until it’s an even thickness of about 4mm. Carefully roll the pastry on to the rolling pin and transfer to a 26cm tart tin. Press firmly into all the corners of the tin, leaving an overhang of roughly 0.5cm. Trim off any excess dough.</p> \n<p>Freeze the pastry case for 15 minutes, then line with baking paper, fill with baking beans and blind bake for 20 minutes, until slightly puffed up. Remove the paper and beans, and bake for 10-15 minutes longer, until the case is completely cooked (take care not to burn it, so check after 10 minutes).</p> \n<p>Turn down the oven to 140C/285F/gas mark 1. Run a sharp knife along the edges of the tart shell to neaten it, then pour in the custard, filling it up right to the brim. Bake in the centre of the oven for about 50 minutes, until just set – it shouldn’t wobble in the centre when you gently shake the tin. Leave the tart to cool completely, and serve with fresh raspberries.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of
