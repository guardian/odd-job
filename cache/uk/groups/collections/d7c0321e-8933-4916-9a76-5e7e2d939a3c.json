They spoiled us rotten with small renditions of their classic dishes, one of which was a simple strawberry gazpacho that was refreshing, fragrant and deeply satisfying all at the same time. It inspired me to make my own version.</p> \n<p>Like strawberries, broad beans are also in the height of season, though you could use frozen for the herby, garlicky puree to go with glazed, fennel-spiced pork (and you don’t need to peel the skins, either). Magic.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato gazpacho with strawberries</strong></h2> \n<p>The cucumber, chilli and oil add savouriness to the tomatoes and strawberries, while the almonds give body (if you’re allergic to nuts, use bread for bulk instead). The soup should be <em>very </em>cold. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>60g blanched almonds</strong><br /><strong>2 fat cloves garlic, peeled, cut in half lengthways and green core removed</strong><br /><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>1 small bunch basil (set aside a few leaves to garnish)</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, stem removed</strong><br /><strong>1 Lebanese cucumber (or &frac12; a large one)</strong><br /><strong>300g strawberries, stems removed</strong><br /><strong>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong><br /><strong>1.2kg very ripe tomatoes</strong></p> \n<p>To serve<br /><strong>2 small Hass avocados, peeled, stoned and diced (do this at the last minute, so they don’t discolour)</strong><br /><strong>A few strawberries, diced</strong><br /><strong>The juice of 1 lime</strong><br /><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put a frying pan on a medium heat. Toast the almonds, shaking the pan occasionally, until pale golden and nutty-smelling. Tip into a food processor and blitz with the garlic, a teaspoon of salt, the basil and chilli, until the nuts are ground to dust. Top and tail the cucumber, add to the processor with the strawberries, oil and vinegar, and blitz to a smooth puree. Add the tomatoes and plenty of black pepper, and blitz until smooth – if your food processor is too full, transfer half the mix to a bowl and blitz in two phases.</p> \n<p>Now taste: chilling dulls the flavours, so make sure you can taste all the ingredients, and season with salt, pepper and vinegar as needed; if you like heat, you may want to add another chilli, too, but chop it finely before you whizz it in, so it gets fully incorporated. Pour into a suitable container, cover and chill for a good few hours.</p> \n<p>When you are ready to eat, roll up the reserved basil leaves and shred finely. Put the diced avocado and strawberries in a bowl, season and add the lime juice and a few tablespoons of oil.</p> \n<p>Serve the soup in small bowls (it is very filling) garnished with spoonfuls of avocado and strawberry relish and a scattering of basil.</p> \n<h2><strong>Griddled pork tenderloin with crushed broad beans</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"790bc2f9870da15713020aa24af4d94adce76426\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436268800372/80f85088-03d8-46c2-b6e9-03bf105101b3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' griddled pork tenderloin with crushed broad beans: 'An easy way to impress friends.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ griddled pork tenderloin with crushed broad beans: ‘An easy way to impress friends.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

An easy way to impress friends. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>2 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>Sea salt and black pepper</strong><br /><strong>3 bay leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 heaped tsp fennel seeds</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp black peppercorns</strong><br /><strong>&frac12; tsp dried chilli flakes (Turkish, ideally)</strong><br /><strong>A few sprigs fresh thyme, picked and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>A few sprigs fresh rosemary, picked and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong> </strong></p> \n<p><strong>50g dark brown sugar</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp balsamic vinegar</strong><br /><strong>800g pork loin fillet</strong><br /><strong>Olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>For the broad bean puree<br /><strong>4 cloves garlic, peeled, cut in half lengthways and green core removed</strong><br /><strong>2 bay leaves</strong><br /><strong>300ml single cream</strong><br /><strong>400g podded broad beans (fresh or frozen)</strong><br /><strong>A squeeze of lemon</strong><br /><strong>1 handful each fresh dill and mint, picked and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 small handful pine nuts, toasted</strong></p> \n<p>Crush the garlic in a mortar with half a teaspoon of flaky sea salt. Add the bay leaves, fennel, peppercorns and chilli, grind for a few minutes, then work in the herbs. Stir in the sugar and vinegar, then rub into the pork with a few tablespoons of oil. Put in the fridge to marinate for an hour.</p> \n<p>Put the garlic in a pan with the bay and cream, and bring slowly to a boil. Turn down the heat and simmer gently until the garlic is soft, about 10 minutes. Discard the bay and blitz the garlic and cream with a stick blender. Return to the heat and simmer gently while you cook the beans in a pan of salted water for a few minutes, until just tender.</p> \n<p>Drain the beans, add to the cream mix and blitz until half the beans are crushed and the rest retain some shape. Season, add the herbs and a squeeze of lemon, and keep warm.</p> \n<p>Heat a griddle pan on a medium heat. Rub the fillets in oil and season well, then grill for about 10 minutes in all, brushing frequently with the oily marinade, until blackened and glazed all over. Remove from the heat, leave to rest for five minutes, then cut a piece in half – if it needs more cooking, slap it back on the griddle. Cut the fillets into avocado-length slices, then cut each slice diagonally in half. Serve with the warm broad bean mix, the meat’s resting juices, a few extra herbs and a scattering of pine nuts.</p> \n<h2><strong>And for the rest of the week</strong></h2> \n<p>I can drink gazpacho at any time of day, though I particularly like it for breakfast when I’ve overdone things the night before – it’s a really refreshing, and also filling, alternative to toast. The bean puree is gorgeous tossed just as it is into spaghetti; before serving, scatter in a few extra herbs and olive oil to liven it up. Cut leftover pork into wafer-thin slices, and toss into a stir-fry or eat cold for lunch with apple chutney and a few salads.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/7/1436268649422/Thomasina-Miers-tomato-ga-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thomasina Miers' tomato gazpacho with strawberries: 'Refreshing.'                 Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Just don’t forget the sugar…</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>In this age of prolific food photography and Instagramming, it’s no surprise that the gooseberry has fallen out of favour – these fat little berries aren’t the most attractive fruit. Some blush to a reddish purple colour as summer wears on, but most are pale green, watery looking, peppered with little seeds. They have a tendency to sink into a grey-green mush when cooked. Often they’re spiked with light bristles. But if you can look past their appearance, you’ll find them a delight to cook with: sharp, sour, bright – a remedy to summer’s heat and an unlikely kitchen hero.</p> \n<p>In early summer, the gooseberries on the shelves are the young, green ones – plump but firm, just soft enough to pinch between your fingers. The sugar quantities in these recipes reflect that: a lot of sweetness is needed to offset the mouth-puckering sharpness of these under-ripe fruits. As the season goes on, though, the gooseberries grow softer and sweeter. If you’re cooking with riper berries, you might want to tweak the amount of sugar in the sorbet and the crumble filling, to taste.</p> \n<h2><strong>Sweet wine and gooseberry sorbet</strong></h2> \n<p>Because sorbet needs a hefty dose of sugar to stop it from freezing solid, it works best with fruits that can balance that sweetness with acidity. Traditionally that would be lemon, but gooseberry works perfectly too.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />450g gooseberries<br />150-200g caster sugar<br />200ml sweet white wine, such as Muscatel</p> \n<p>1 Simmer the gooseberries, 150g sugar and half the wine together over a low heat for 10 minutes, until the gooseberries are very soft. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve, pressing through as much of the gooseberry juice and pulp as possible. Discard the skins, seeds and stalks.</p> \n<p>2 Decant into a large, lidded plastic container, stir in the remaining wine and add another 50g sugar to taste. Make the sorbet sweeter than seems right, as the flavours will dull when it’s frozen. Leave to cool to room temperature. Transfer to the fridge to thoroughly chill before moving the sorbet to the freezer to set.</p> \n<p>3 Stir vigorously at half-hour intervals for the first couple of hours of freezing time to break up any large ice crystals, then leave to freeze completely overnight. Allow to soften slightly in the fridge prior to serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard</strong></h2> \n<p>A gently sweet coconut-crumble topping balances the fruit’s bite without smothering its bright flavour. And as much as I love gooseberries, a 100% gooseberry crumble is a little too tart even for my tastes. To that end, I’ve used a mixture of gooseberry and apple for the filling, the apple lending a welcome textural contrast to the gooseberries’ yielding softness, while mellowing the taste. You can, of course, cook this in a single, larger oven dish if you prefer, baking for 40 minutes or so.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69a68984a095a2abb8ff055f7fb8394ae34dc80f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438482535/00fbe552-eeff-440d-a8c2-8dd1e957ff6e-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard.

Toss the fruit together with the sugar and set aside while you make the crumble.</p> \n<p>2 Stir the flour, coconut and sugar together in a large bowl, then rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture’s sandy. Divide the fruit between six ramekins, add a thick layer of crumble to each and bake for 30 minutes, until the puddings are bubbling and the topping’s crisp.</p> \n<p>3 While the crumbles are cooking, make the custard. Heat the coconut milk until it’s just about to boil. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a separate mixing bowl, then slowly pour the scalding-hot coconut milk into the bowl, whisking constantly. Once you’ve added all the milk, decant the custard back into the pan. Stir it over a very low heat for five minutes or so, until it’s smooth and coats the back of the spoon. It’ll quickly curdle if it’s overcooked, though, so take it off the heat as soon as it’s a pourable custard consistency, and don’t let it boil. Once it’s ready, whisk in the vanilla extract and serve with the hot puddings.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake</strong></h2> \n<p>This is one of those blessedly easy cakes that you can rustle together the second the craving hits you – just summer fruit scattered through a simple pound cake mix. You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts if you want, but I think the more robust, woody flavour of hazelnut sits well against the bright fruit.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"360152a618142c01feb1829d1a11cd699efc1161\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438621227/40e964f2-cc60-41b7-a59e-af3f90f94fd4-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake: You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you can’t find the ready-ground stuff in the supermarket, just roast blanched hazelnuts at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 8-10 minutes, until toasted to a rich golden hue, then grind to a fine meal in a coffee grinder or food processor.</p> \n<p>I’ve left this uniced because I don’t think it needs much dressing up, but you could always brush the top with water icing or drizzle with white chocolate if you feel the cake needs a lift.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />125g unsalted butter, softened<br />125g caster sugar<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 large eggs<br />125g plain flour<br />50g roasted ground hazelnuts<br />1&frac14; tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />150g gooseberries<br />75g strawberries</p> \n<p> 1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 2lb/900g loaf tin with baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest together until very light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating each one in thoroughly. In a separate bowl, blend the flour, roasted ground hazelnuts, baking powder and salt, then fold this mixture into the wet ingredients until smooth.</p> \n<p>3 Top and tail and then halve the gooseberries. Halve the strawberries, cutting any very large ones into quarters. Mix just over three quarters of the fruit into the cake batter.

With its multiple long, thin stems sprouting from a swollen, globe-shaped base, it looks very weird indeed, like something from outer space.</p> \n<p>For something so odd-looking, however, its flavour is very mild-mannered and neutral. If you’ve never tried kohlrabi, do give it a go. It belongs to the cabbage family and, eaten raw, tastes a&nbsp;bit like a mild sweet radish or cauliflower stalk. Thinly shaved, or cut into batons or dice, and added to a slaw or stir-fry, kohlrabi is crunchy and refreshing, with a little peppery kick for added interest. I love to eat young kohlrabi raw at this time of the year, and slow-cook the larger bulbs in the colder months, especially in a creamy gratin.</p> \n<h2><strong>Kohlrabi and lime salad</strong></h2> \n<p>Possibly the most amount of flavour packed into one of the shortest recipes I’ve ever written. Serves four, generously.</p> \n<p><strong>3 small kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 5mm x 5cm batons (500g net weight)</strong><br /><strong>2 granny smith apples, peeled and cut into 5mm x 5cm batons</strong><br /><strong>2 green chillies, deseeded and julienned</strong><br /><strong>15g picked coriander leaves</strong><br /><strong>15g picked mint leaves</strong><br /><strong>10g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 spring onions, trimmed and thinly&nbsp;sliced</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp black sesame seeds</strong><br /><strong>Finely grated zest of 1 lime, plus 2&frac12;&nbsp;tbsp lime juice</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp groundnut oil</strong><br /><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>80g creme fraiche</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp sesame oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong></p> \n<p>Put all the ingredients apart from the&nbsp;creme fraiche and sesame oil in a&nbsp;big bowl with three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Stir well, then divide between four plates. Spoon creme fraiche on top, followed by a little drizzle of sesame oil, and serve at once. (See, simple.)&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Spicy aubergine with kohlrabi and coconut</strong></h2> \n<p>Serve this with warm naan bread or&nbsp;poppadoms, and maybe some plain&nbsp;rice. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>120ml sunflower oil</strong><br /><strong>1 medium kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 5cm-long and 1cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>2 large onions, peeled and cut into 2cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>3 aubergines, cut into 7cm-long and 3cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>&frac34; tsp turmeric</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp ground cumin</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp black mustard seeds</strong><br /><strong>4 whole sprigs fresh curry leaves (about 30 leaves)</strong><br /><strong>2 large tomatoes, cut into 2cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>80g fresh coconut, finely grated (ie, the flesh from roughly half a small coconut)</strong><br /><strong>220g Greek yoghurt</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp lime juice</strong><br /><strong>20g coriander leaves, roughly chopped</strong></p> \n<p>For the spice paste<br /><strong>4 large stalks lemongrass, woody ends and outer layer removed and discarded, very finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>6cm piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>6 fresh kaffir lime leaves</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, roughly chopped </strong><br /><strong>1 dried red chilli, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 small banana shallot, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>90ml sunflower oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put all the spice paste ingredients apart from the oil in a food processor. With the motor running, slowly add half the oil and process until you have a paste, stopping the machine and scraping the sides of the bowl as you go. Set aside (the remaining three tablespoons of oil will be used to fry the paste later). &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Heat a tablespoon and a half of oil in a large-heavy based saucepan or saute pan for which you have a lid, and put on a medium-high heat. Add the kohlrabi and cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until it starts to soften and turn a dark golden-brown. Tip into a large bowl.</p> \n<p>Pour another tablespoon and a half of oil into the pan, add the onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden-brown. Add to the kohlrabi bowl.</p> \n<p>Add the last of the oil to the pan and fry the aubergines for 15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until soft and golden-brown, but still holding their shape. Stir in the turmeric, cumin and a teaspoon and a half of salt, cook for two minutes, then add the mustard seeds, cook for a minute and add to the kohlrabi bowl.</p> \n<p>Wipe clean the pan and put on a medium-low heat. Add the reserved oil from the spice paste and, when hot, add the paste and fry gently for about 25 minutes, stirring often, until it takes on a nice golden colour. Add the curry leaves and tomatoes, cook for five minutes, then add the fried vegetables and 400ml cold water. Cover and cook on a low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>To serve, divide the curry into bowls and scatter with coconut. Put a spoonful of yoghurt on each portion (serve the rest on the side), add a squeeze of lime and a sprinkling of coriander, and serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Kohlrabi kimchi</strong></h2> \n<p>Kimchi is an acquired taste, but those who enjoy it, myself included, tend to find it addictive, and eat it with just about anything: grilled meat, seafood, or just spooned over a bowl of rice. The longer you leave the kimchi, the more the flavours develop – it will keep in the fridge for several months. Makes about 900g.</p> \n<p><strong>3 large kohlrabi, peeled, cut in half horizontally and then into 5mm-thick&nbsp;slices</strong><br /><strong>12 spring onions, trimmed and cut into 4-5cm slices</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp caster sugar</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>3cm piece ginger, peeled and finely&nbsp;chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp nanami togarashi (Japanese assorted chilli pepper)</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp fish sauce</strong></p> \n<p>Put the kohlrabi and spring onion in a large bowl with the sugar and two teaspoons of salt. Mix and set aside for 45 minutes, stirring once or twice. Drain off any moisture that has leached from the vegetables and add the garlic, ginger, nanami togarashi and fish sauce to the bowl. Mix to combine, cover with cling-film and put somewhere dark and cool for two days. Transfer to a clean airtight container and store in the fridge.</p> \n<h2><strong>Fritti misti</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6adac030eaa8ddaf0c516f2f772c5fc03bb52e1f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435759803973/6e956356-0974-4cd2-86bf-abf5018c4674-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's fritti misti\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s fritti misti: ‘My version of a dish at San Francisco’s legendary Zuni Cafe.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is my version of a dish at San Francisco’s legendary <a href=\"http://www.zunicafe.com\" title=\"\">Zuni Cafe</a>. Use a mandolin, if you have one, to slice the vegetables as thin as they need to be. You can use any seasonal veg you fancy; most will work really well, just as they do&nbsp;for tempura. The batter’s good with seafood, too. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>120g plain flour</strong><br /><strong>120g semolina</strong><br /><strong>1&frac14; tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed</strong><br /><strong>1&frac14; tbsp whole aniseed, roughly crushed</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>400g buttermilk</strong><br /><strong>1 litre sunflower oil, for frying</strong><br /><strong>1 medium&nbsp;kohlrabi, peeled, trimmed and cut into 5mm-wide rounds</strong><br /><strong>1 medium desiree potato, peeled and cut&nbsp;lengthways&nbsp;into 3mm-wide rounds</strong><br /><strong>1 small fennel bulb, trimmed and cut lengthways into 5mm-wide slices </strong><br /><strong>1 lemon, cut into 2mm-thick slices, plus 4 lemon halves for squeezing</strong><br /><strong>20&nbsp;large&nbsp;sage leaves</strong><br /><strong>40g capers, rinsed and patted dry</strong></p> \n<p>Put the flour, semolina, coriander, aniseed and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt in a shallow bowl. Mix well and set aside. Pour the buttermilk into a separate shallow bowl.</p> \n<p>Pour the oil into a large saucepan and put on a medium-high heat for five to six minutes, until it reaches 160C (if you have one, use a probe or thermometer to check). While the oil is warming, dip the kohlrabi a slice at time into first the buttermilk and then the flour, just so it’s roughly covered. Once all the kohlrabi is battered, carefully drop the slices into the oil in batches of about&nbsp;eight&nbsp;and fry for&nbsp;two to three minutes, turning once halfway through, until golden-brown on both sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a wire rack lined with kitchen paper; transfer to a medium oven to keep hot while you repeat with the remaining kohlrabi.</p> \n<p>Batter and cook the potato, fennel, lemon and sage in the same way: the potato and fennel will take two to three minutes, the lemon one to two minutes and the sage only about 30 seconds. Don’t worry if they are not evenly covered by the batter: the finished dish looks better if you can see some of the vegetable through the crisp coating.</p> \n<p>Once all the vegetables are fried, add the capers to the oil (ie, don’t dip them in the buttermilk and flour first) and fry on a medium heat for a&nbsp;minute, until they open up like flowers and go crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and add to the vegetables. Transfer the fritti misti to a large platter or individual plates, and serve with the&nbsp;lemon halves to squeeze over.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\" title=\"\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\" title=\"\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/1/1435759590348/Yotam-Ottolenghis-kohlrab-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yotam Ottolenghi's kohlrabi and lime salad: 'Possibly the most amount of flavour packed into one of the shortest recipes I've written.'

It also sounds like a balanced one, and I’m glad to hear how well she took her own advice. Meals in which cheese is allowed to take the place of another protein are no worse for your arteries and as good for your soul as any others. I don’t like to think of food as carbohydrates and fat because it gives an incomplete picture of how we digest.

But it does absolutely make you full. Eating a piece of cheese instead of meat is a good allocation of digestive resources. If it’s not slathered on top of a steak, but in its place, there’s no reason a large piece of strong runny cheese, or whatever cheese your beer hall serves, can’t be a meal, eaten with good bread.</p> \n<p>It’s also a good allocation of environmental resources. The managed grazing of pastured animals is as good for land as factory farming is bad for it. And it carries a karmic bonus. An animal you milk parts only with her milk. Tomorrow, she will go on munching grass. Her inclination will inspire her to make more milk, and your cheesemaker to make more cheese.</p> \n<p>Talk to someone behind a cheese counter. You will get to taste – and you will do a good deed. Cheesemongers are categorically zealous. Their counters are their pulpits, and they live to share their gospel. You will notice, if you approach one with a question, his eyes widenand lips quiver with excitement at a chance to spread the Word.</p> \n<p>You will also get good stories. Cheesemakers are incorrigible romantics. It is part of what inspires zealotry in their acolytes. Tommes from Bordeaux, raw sheep’s milk cheeses from Sardinia, creamy Robiolas from the Piedmont region of Italy, and hundred more that are made from the milk of cows and sheep that have never been fed by human hands, are referred to as <em>sotto cielo</em>, Italian for “under the sky”.</p> \n<p>If there’s no cheese counter at your local shop, look for small logs of chevre.
