I decided to make jelly. There is something entirely frivolous about the idea of setting fruit juice so that it wobbles on your spoon. No one needs jelly. It is there simply to amuse and delight. Making jelly is escapist cooking. Like trifles, whim-whams and blancmanges, they are there simply for fun.</p> \n<p>The stone fruits – particularly peaches, nectarines and apricots – are in fine fettle at the moment. I bought flat white peaches this week that smelled like roses, and apricots that had an almost wine-like scent. The peaches ended up in a softly set jelly of elderflower cordial; the apricots were warmed with a splash of orange, then crushed and embedded in juice set with very little gelatine. A grown-up version of the much-loved mandarin-orange jelly of my childhood.</p> \n<p>Take it easy on the sugar and pick your fruits wisely – redcurrants or blackcurrants, stone fruits, rhubarb or oranges – and you get an extraordinary clarity of colour and vibrancy of flavour. (The acidity in currants can affect the set, so a few more sheets of gelatine are required.) Leaf or sheet gelatine, the sort that comes in paper envelopes rather than as fine powder in sachets, is the sort I prefer. It is a doddle to use. Just soak the leaves in cold water for five minutes until they have collapsed and softened, then lift the result out of the water and stir it into warm juice or a mixture of juice and wine. It really couldn’t be easier.</p> \n<p>I make mine the day I intend to eat them, giving them a maximum of six hours in the fridge. Any longer, even overnight, and they firm up just a little too much. In my book, a jelly should quiver rather than bounce.</p> \n<h2>Apricot jelly</h2> \n<p>Ripeness is all with this fruit, but if you are working with less than perfect specimens, as is sometimes the case, cook them for a few minutes longer than in the recipe below, sweetening them with a tablespoon or so of caster sugar.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>apricots</strong> 500g<br /><strong>orange juice</strong> 500ml (6 medium oranges)<br /><strong>leaf gelatine</strong> 12g (6 sheets)<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>double cream</strong> 250ml<br /><strong>rose petals</strong> (optional)<br /></p> \n<p>Finely grate the zest of one of the oranges on to a plate and set aside.</p> \n<p>Cut each apricot in half, discard the stone, then put the fruit in a medium-sized saucepan. Pour in 4 tbsp of the orange juice and let the apricots cook, partially covered with a lid, for 10 minutes or until they are vivid in colour and soft enough to pure&eacute;.</p> \n<p>Crush the apricots with a fork, so they are part way between chopped fruit and pur&eacute;e. Spoon the fruit into a shallow serving dish, about 22-24cm in diameter.</p> \n<p>Soak the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water, pushing the leaves under the water one at the time to prevent them from sticking.</p> \n<p>Warm the orange juice in a saucepan, but do not let it boil. Remove the gelatine from the water – it should be a squishy lump – and stir it into the hot orange juice. When the gelatine has completely dissolved, pour over the crushed apricots and allow to cool. Transfer to the fridge and leave for a couple of hours to set.</p> \n<p>Put the grated orange and the sugar into a food processor and blitz for a few seconds, until the sugar has turned a pale-orange colour. Alternatively crush the sugar and orange zest together using a pestle and mortar. Stop when the zest has lightly coloured and perfumed the sugar.</p> \n<p>To serve, softly whip the cream (not so stiff it can stand in peaks) and place in spoonfuls around the edge of the dish. Decorate with the orange-scented sugar and, if you wish, a few rose petals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf26e4f00e85758825d705f75f03ba12df8bfb52\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436276511359/de69118e-dbe7-4453-afcd-b4f644b09ef5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"White peach and elderflower jelly with a sprig of elderflower in a small glass bowl\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Pick your fruits wisely and you get an extraordinary clarity of colour and vibrancy of flavour,’ says Nigel Slater.

They are less fragrant, but their colour makes up for it. I have included a spoonful of sugar in this recipe as I feel that, despite the sweetness of the elderflower cordial, the jelly benefits from it. Leave it out if you prefer.</p> \n<p>Makes 4<br />For the peaches:<br /><strong>white peaches</strong> 125g<br /><strong>lemon</strong> juice of <strong>&frac12;</strong><br /></p> \n<p>For the jelly:<br /><strong>leaf gelatine</strong> 10g (6 small sheets) <br /><strong>elderflower cordial</strong> 100ml<br /><strong>white wine</strong> 350ml<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 1 tbsp (optional) <br /></p> \n<p>Half-fill a mixing bowl with cold water then add the sheets of gelatine. If you do this one at a time, it will prevent them from sticking together. Leave the gelatine to soften for 10 minutes, in which time it becomes a clear, spongy mass.</p> \n<p>Pour the elderflower cordial and white wine into a medium-sized saucepan, add the sugar (or not, if you prefer a sharper jelly) and warm over a moderate heat. Don’t let the mixture boil, which would affect the gelatine’s setting qualities.</p> \n<p>Cut the peaches in half then into thin slices, discarding the stone as you go, then toss them gently in the lemon juice to prevent them from browning. Divide the peaches among four small serving dishes.</p> \n<p>Lower the softened gelatine into the warmed cordial and wine, then stir until it has dissolved. It should disappear almost instantly. Pour into a jug then into the dishes to cover the peaches, then refrigerate for about four hours, until lightly set.</p> \n<p><br />Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436276258550/April-jelly-decorated-aro-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Soft on fruit: Nigel Slater's apricot jelly recipe.

Fry 3 sliced spring onions and a finely chopped garlic clove in a little oil, then add 4 cobs’ worth of fresh corn and a sprig of thyme. Cook for around 5 minutes, until tender. Remove a heaped spoonful of veg and set aside. Add around 600ml veg stock such as bouillon, and a few peeled new potatoes, chopped into small cubes. Bring to a simmer and cook until the potatoes are done. Whizz with a hand blender, leaving it a bit chunky. Add a splash more water if needed, season to taste, and add the spoonful of veg your removed before back in. To make it creamy, stir through 1 tbsp creme fraiche.

The dry winds of summer that can crisp a lawn in a day are gone. Instead the suburbs and gardens are lush. The wattle is in flower, blooms cascading over fences in a riot of yellow. Flowering gums are heavy with nectar, and violets make their appearance in cool dark corners of gardens. Often where nothing else will grow, the violet will thrive, making a carpet of soft, dark green leaves, and at this time of year dainty purple flowers. </p> \n<p>Violets, pansies and violas all have edible blooms. Pansies and violas have varying degrees of dark velvety faces or blotches on the petals – viola being the genus name, as well as the flower. (The African violet is another thing entirely and should not be eaten.) The tender, new leaves of violets can be used in salads, as well as the blooms themselves. <br /></p> \n<p>In Melbourne the violets are blooming now, and for this recipe we picked violets from the garden, in the morning, when the blooms were just opened, plump and fresh. The distinctive white and purple bloom of the Australian native violet is also edible, and can be treated in the same way as the purple violets in the recipe given below, but they flower towards the warmer months of the year. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2c9fe791f8fc6c6a3c7f0793bc8fd4db7eeca90\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a2c9fe791f8fc6c6a3c7f0793bc8fd4db7eeca90/0_0_2362_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Violets are blooming now.

Firstly make sure you have properly identified the blooms, and secondly make sure your flowers are pesticide free. Don’t pick from roadsides, instead from your own or a known garden is best. Beware of eating flowers from florists as you don’t know how the flowers have been treated. An exception would be purchasing from an organic flower producer. </p> \n<p>The sugared violets retain their delicate scent and the taste is sweet and floral. It is much more subtle than a sugared rose petal, but still distinctive. Atop a cake, as in the recipe below, sugared violets make the most gorgeous edible decorative. </p> \n<h2>For the violets: </h2> \n<p>A bunch of violets or pansies home grown and pesticide free<br />1 egg white<br />1 tsp of water<br />1 cup of caster sugar </p> \n<p>Whisk the egg white in a small bowl, with the water.

Who doesn’t like the lovely yellow stuff? It’s an absolute cinch to make and improves just about every dessert. However, that’s all it’s really good for. Luckily the clever French came up with cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re (literally “pastry cream”) – a thickened, more stable version of custard that is much better for baking with. You can make a big batch at the weekend, then keep it wrapped in your fridge until you’re ready to use it – it’ll last five days. It can also be used as the base for fruit in tarts, piped into profiteroles or spread between layers of cake.</p> \n<p><strong>To make the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re<br /></strong>Don’t panic if it goes a little lumpy; just keep stirring and it will eventually become smooth and silken. If all else fails, however, pass through a sieve.</p> \n<p><strong>Makes about 1.6kg</strong><br />1 litre whole milk<br />300ml double cream<br />1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped<br />12 egg yolks<br />240g caster sugar<br />40g cornflour<br />40g plain flour<br />Icing sugar, to dust</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Put the milk, cream, vanilla pod and seeds in a large heavy-based pan and bring up to the boil. Keep an eye on it as it can easily boil over. Immediately turn down to a simmer and let it bubble away for 3 minutes.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Meanwhile, whisk together the yolks and sugar until pale and light, then whisk in the flours. Take the milk off the heat and allow to cool for a minute or so. Discard the vanilla pod.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Slowly whisk about a third of the warm milk into the egg mix, then pour that into the milk pan and return to a low heat. Whisking constantly, slowly return to the boil, allowing it to bubble for 1 minute only. You’ll find that it’ll thicken almost immediately. Turn the heat down and continue to whisk for another couple of minutes to cook out the flour. It may start off a bit lumpy, but continue whisking and it’ll soon become smooth. Immediately transfer to a large baking dish or your largest Tupperware, smooth the top, sprinkle the surface with icing sugar (this prevents a skin forming), then leave to cool.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/18/custard-tart-brits-portugal-pasteis-de-nata\">Custard tart fight: can the British version ever compete with Portugal’s past&eacute;is de nata?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>The teatime treat: easy Portuguese custard tarts</strong></h2> \n<p>Quick and simple to whip up – the key is not to faff around with pastry too much: the warmer it gets, the less it tends to behave. These are very similar to the Portugese version, just with added cinnamon swirling in the pastry.</p> \n<p><strong>Makes 12</strong><br />A small knob of butter<br />300g pre-rolled puff pastry, cold<br />1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />1 heaped tsp caster sugar<br />450g cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re <br />100g whole milk<br />Icing sugar, to dust</p> \n<p><strong>1 </strong>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Generously butter a 12-hole muffin tray. Cut the pastry in half across the middle, then sprinkle one half evenly with the cinnamon and the sugar. Put the other half on top, then roll out again into a sheet the same size as the original sheet. Roll up tightly like a swiss roll, then cut into 12 even slices. Roll each slice into 10cm-diameter discs, then press into the muffin tray and stab a few times with a fork.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Transfer the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re into a saucepan and place over a medium-low heat. Whisk in the milk until mixed – the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re will become very lumpy but will become smooth again with some brisk whisking and a little heat. Allow to cool for 5 minutes.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Spoon the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re into each pastry, filling them right up to the brim (it may seem like too much, but it will rise and deflate). Dust each one with a little icing sugar. Put in the oven for 35-45 minutes until the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re has a few dark spots and the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin completely before serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>The summer bake: cherry and custard cake</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b8c5a8e83b4024fd6e1d5992df0916e497dfe72\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436440831759/79518991-5003-42de-be82-bd64829f4fc8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cherry and custard cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cherry and custard cake: like a summer party in your mouth.

You can always substitute the cherries with other fruit if you wish: blackberries would be great, as would raspberries or blueberries.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 10</strong><br /><strong>For the cherries</strong><br />45g soft brown sugar<br />400g cherries, stoned and halved<br />1 tbsp butter, plus extra for greasing</p> \n<p><strong> For the cake</strong><br />150g soft brown sugar<br />150g butter, at room temperature<br />3 eggs<br />150g plain flour<br />4 tbsp ground almonds<br />1&frac12; tsp baking powder<br />350g cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line and grease a 21cm cake tin with butter.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> For the cherries, put the sugar and 1 tbsp of water in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and cook for a moment until it begins to bubble and the sugar has dissolved. Stir in the cherries and butter and cook for a few minutes until the fruit begins to soften, then take off the heat.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> For the cake, cream together the sugar and butter until pale and light. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then fold in the flour, almonds and baking powder.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Pour a third of the batter into the tin, spread it out with a wet table knife, then dollop over teaspoonfuls of the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re and spoon the cherries on top, leaving behind the juices (use for a cocktail!). Spoon the remaining batter over the top, spread again with a wet table or palette knife and put in the oven for 60-70 minutes. Cover it with a little baking paper after 50 minutes or so if it’s turning a little too brown. A skewer put in the centre should emerge clean if it’s done. Leave to cool in the tin before serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>The classic dessert: peach, raspberry and custard trifle</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75ad43ecb7215422c6779309631e139e19b14346\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436440928006/62021d78-0dd1-496a-9398-fccdbba3ff41-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Peach, raspberry and custard trifle\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peach, raspberry and custard trifle may be retro, but that doesn’t mean it’s not zingy. Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite being embarrassingly retro, trifle is still a brilliant dessert, with its colourful layers and different textures. It takes just a few minutes to assemble and sits in your fridge happily, so is a great last-minute or do-in-advance pud. This version is inspired by the wonderful peach melba, but you can of course use whatever fruit you have at hand, such as plums or just berries.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 8</strong><br />4 peaches<br />40g caster sugar<br />2 tbsp floral honey<br />200ml sweet white wine (water works just as well)<br />200g raspberries, plus a few reserved for decoration<br />220g shop-bought madeira cake or leftover sponge cake<br />400g cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re <br />300ml double cream<br />50g toasted flaked almonds</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Peel the peaches first: Put the fruit in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave for 2-3- seconds, then scoop out and immediately cool under running cold water. Use a small knife to remove the skins, remove the stone and cut the fruit into eighths. Put to one side.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Put the sugar, honey and wine in a large pan and simmer over a medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves. As it begins to simmer gently, add the peaches and cover with a round piece of baking paper. Leave the peaches to continue simmering for 7-8 minutes until just tender, then scoop out and place at the bottom of your trifle bowl. Return the pan to the heat and boil the syrup for 8-10 minutes to reduce it, then pour it over the peaches and leave to cool.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Once the peaches are cool, spread the raspberries on top in an even layer. Cut the cake into 1cm-thick slices then place on top of the raspberries. Spoon the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re over the cake slices. In a large clean bowl, whisk the double cream until you have soft peaks, then spoon it over the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re , working from the outside in (this will prevent the cream sinking into the custard). Chill it in the fridge for an hour.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Scatter the almonds on top and decorate with a few reserved raspberries before serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>The moreish morsel: Spanish leche fritta with cinnamon</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d70928a964210ce704f472e4b584d197553b00d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436441015031/f33c0bde-58e5-4b0f-b68f-5cb9b3dc5522-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Spanish leche fritta with cinnamon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spanish leche fritta with cinnamon – if fried custard seems strange, that’s only because you’ve not tried it.

The key to this is that the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re is chilled enough, as it won’t hold together if too warm. Deep-frying can be terrifying at home, but using a wok somehow makes it less stressful. A jam thermometer is also very useful in this situation.</p> \n<p><strong>Makes 8 pieces (serves 4)</strong><br />400g cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re , chilled<br />Vegetable oil, for frying<br />100g plain flour<br />1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />100g caster sugar</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Cut the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re into 50g/5 x 5cm cubes and keep chilled in the fridge until you need them.</p> \n<p><strong>2 </strong>Place a wok or a deep, heavy-based pan over a medium-high heat and add enough oil to come 4cm up the sides. Heat until a thermometer registers 180C or until a cube of bread turns golden in 45 seconds.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Sprinkle the flour over a large plate and mix the cinnamon and sugar on another plate. Prepare a third plate with kitchen paper for draining the leche fritta when it comes out the oil.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Working in batches of 4 squares at a time, coat each square in the flour, then very carefully lower into the hot oil and cook for 60-90 seconds until golden, then scoop out, leave to drain for a second on the kitchen paper and very gently toss in the cinnamon sugar mix before serving.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>The Kitchen Cooperative – Georgia Levy and Benjamin Benton – are caterers, consultants and cooks.

They spoiled us rotten with small renditions of their classic dishes, one of which was a simple strawberry gazpacho that was refreshing, fragrant and deeply satisfying all at the same time. It inspired me to make my own version.</p> \n<p>Like strawberries, broad beans are also in the height of season, though you could use frozen for the herby, garlicky puree to go with glazed, fennel-spiced pork (and you don’t need to peel the skins, either). Magic.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato gazpacho with strawberries</strong></h2> \n<p>The cucumber, chilli and oil add savouriness to the tomatoes and strawberries, while the almonds give body (if you’re allergic to nuts, use bread for bulk instead). The soup should be <em>very </em>cold. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>60g blanched almonds</strong><br /><strong>2 fat cloves garlic, peeled, cut in half lengthways and green core removed</strong><br /><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>1 small bunch basil (set aside a few leaves to garnish)</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, stem removed</strong><br /><strong>1 Lebanese cucumber (or &frac12; a large one)</strong><br /><strong>300g strawberries, stems removed</strong><br /><strong>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong><br /><strong>1.2kg very ripe tomatoes</strong></p> \n<p>To serve<br /><strong>2 small Hass avocados, peeled, stoned and diced (do this at the last minute, so they don’t discolour)</strong><br /><strong>A few strawberries, diced</strong><br /><strong>The juice of 1 lime</strong><br /><strong>Extra-virgin olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put a frying pan on a medium heat. Toast the almonds, shaking the pan occasionally, until pale golden and nutty-smelling. Tip into a food processor and blitz with the garlic, a teaspoon of salt, the basil and chilli, until the nuts are ground to dust. Top and tail the cucumber, add to the processor with the strawberries, oil and vinegar, and blitz to a smooth puree. Add the tomatoes and plenty of black pepper, and blitz until smooth – if your food processor is too full, transfer half the mix to a bowl and blitz in two phases.</p> \n<p>Now taste: chilling dulls the flavours, so make sure you can taste all the ingredients, and season with salt, pepper and vinegar as needed; if you like heat, you may want to add another chilli, too, but chop it finely before you whizz it in, so it gets fully incorporated.

Rub the fillets in oil and season well, then grill for about 10 minutes in all, brushing frequently with the oily marinade, until blackened and glazed all over. Remove from the heat, leave to rest for five minutes, then cut a piece in half – if it needs more cooking, slap it back on the griddle. Cut the fillets into avocado-length slices, then cut each slice diagonally in half. Serve with the warm broad bean mix, the meat’s resting juices, a few extra herbs and a scattering of pine nuts.</p> \n<h2><strong>And for the rest of the week</strong></h2> \n<p>I can drink gazpacho at any time of day, though I particularly like it for breakfast when I’ve overdone things the night before – it’s a really refreshing, and also filling, alternative to toast. The bean puree is gorgeous tossed just as it is into spaghetti; before serving, scatter in a few extra herbs and olive oil to liven it up. Cut leftover pork into wafer-thin slices, and toss into a stir-fry or eat cold for lunch with apple chutney and a few salads.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/7/1436268649422/Thomasina-Miers-tomato-ga-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thomasina Miers' tomato gazpacho with strawberries: 'Refreshing.'                 Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian.

Just don’t forget the sugar…</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>In this age of prolific food photography and Instagramming, it’s no surprise that the gooseberry has fallen out of favour – these fat little berries aren’t the most attractive fruit. Some blush to a reddish purple colour as summer wears on, but most are pale green, watery looking, peppered with little seeds. They have a tendency to sink into a grey-green mush when cooked. Often they’re spiked with light bristles. But if you can look past their appearance, you’ll find them a delight to cook with: sharp, sour, bright – a remedy to summer’s heat and an unlikely kitchen hero.</p> \n<p>In early summer, the gooseberries on the shelves are the young, green ones – plump but firm, just soft enough to pinch between your fingers. The sugar quantities in these recipes reflect that: a lot of sweetness is needed to offset the mouth-puckering sharpness of these under-ripe fruits. As the season goes on, though, the gooseberries grow softer and sweeter. If you’re cooking with riper berries, you might want to tweak the amount of sugar in the sorbet and the crumble filling, to taste.</p> \n<h2><strong>Sweet wine and gooseberry sorbet</strong></h2> \n<p>Because sorbet needs a hefty dose of sugar to stop it from freezing solid, it works best with fruits that can balance that sweetness with acidity. Traditionally that would be lemon, but gooseberry works perfectly too.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />450g gooseberries<br />150-200g caster sugar<br />200ml sweet white wine, such as Muscatel</p> \n<p>1 Simmer the gooseberries, 150g sugar and half the wine together over a low heat for 10 minutes, until the gooseberries are very soft. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve, pressing through as much of the gooseberry juice and pulp as possible. Discard the skins, seeds and stalks.</p> \n<p>2 Decant into a large, lidded plastic container, stir in the remaining wine and add another 50g sugar to taste. Make the sorbet sweeter than seems right, as the flavours will dull when it’s frozen. Leave to cool to room temperature. Transfer to the fridge to thoroughly chill before moving the sorbet to the freezer to set.</p> \n<p>3 Stir vigorously at half-hour intervals for the first couple of hours of freezing time to break up any large ice crystals, then leave to freeze completely overnight. Allow to soften slightly in the fridge prior to serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard</strong></h2> \n<p>A gently sweet coconut-crumble topping balances the fruit’s bite without smothering its bright flavour. And as much as I love gooseberries, a 100% gooseberry crumble is a little too tart even for my tastes. To that end, I’ve used a mixture of gooseberry and apple for the filling, the apple lending a welcome textural contrast to the gooseberries’ yielding softness, while mellowing the taste. You can, of course, cook this in a single, larger oven dish if you prefer, baking for 40 minutes or so.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69a68984a095a2abb8ff055f7fb8394ae34dc80f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438482535/00fbe552-eeff-440d-a8c2-8dd1e957ff6e-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard.

Toss the fruit together with the sugar and set aside while you make the crumble.</p> \n<p>2 Stir the flour, coconut and sugar together in a large bowl, then rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture’s sandy. Divide the fruit between six ramekins, add a thick layer of crumble to each and bake for 30 minutes, until the puddings are bubbling and the topping’s crisp.</p> \n<p>3 While the crumbles are cooking, make the custard. Heat the coconut milk until it’s just about to boil. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a separate mixing bowl, then slowly pour the scalding-hot coconut milk into the bowl, whisking constantly. Once you’ve added all the milk, decant the custard back into the pan. Stir it over a very low heat for five minutes or so, until it’s smooth and coats the back of the spoon. It’ll quickly curdle if it’s overcooked, though, so take it off the heat as soon as it’s a pourable custard consistency, and don’t let it boil. Once it’s ready, whisk in the vanilla extract and serve with the hot puddings.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake</strong></h2> \n<p>This is one of those blessedly easy cakes that you can rustle together the second the craving hits you – just summer fruit scattered through a simple pound cake mix. You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts if you want, but I think the more robust, woody flavour of hazelnut sits well against the bright fruit.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"360152a618142c01feb1829d1a11cd699efc1161\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438621227/40e964f2-cc60-41b7-a59e-af3f90f94fd4-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake: You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you can’t find the ready-ground stuff in the supermarket, just roast blanched hazelnuts at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 8-10 minutes, until toasted to a rich golden hue, then grind to a fine meal in a coffee grinder or food processor.</p> \n<p>I’ve left this uniced because I don’t think it needs much dressing up, but you could always brush the top with water icing or drizzle with white chocolate if you feel the cake needs a lift.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />125g unsalted butter, softened<br />125g caster sugar<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 large eggs<br />125g plain flour<br />50g roasted ground hazelnuts<br />1&frac14; tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />150g gooseberries<br />75g strawberries</p> \n<p> 1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 2lb/900g loaf tin with baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest together until very light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating each one in thoroughly. In a separate bowl, blend the flour, roasted ground hazelnuts, baking powder and salt, then fold this mixture into the wet ingredients until smooth.</p> \n<p>3 Top and tail and then halve the gooseberries. Halve the strawberries, cutting any very large ones into quarters. Mix just over three quarters of the fruit into the cake batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared tin then scatter the remaining fruit on top and press gently in.</p> \n<p>4 Bake in the preheated oven for around an hour, until the cake is well risen and golden. A knife inserted into the deepest part of the cake should come out clean when the cake is cooked through.
