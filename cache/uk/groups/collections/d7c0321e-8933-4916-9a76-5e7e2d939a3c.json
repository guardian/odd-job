Get flash with your florets and turn them into spicy patties, a substantial salad, speedy nasi goreng and warm cheesy bake</p>","byline":"Rosie Reynolds","body":"<p>Creamy cauliflower florets are the perfect vehicle for batch cooking for three good reasons. First, they can take the weight of strong, punchy flavours. As the cauliflower cooks, the florets open up ever so slightly exposing yet more surface area for spices and sauces to get into. Second, the texture of cauliflower is so variable: you can keep your florets charred and crisp in salads, or yielding and comforting when slathered in cheese sauce. And third, it helps that cauliflowers are often the size of a football, so unless you’re feeding a crowd, you will have plenty of leftovers for the week ahead. Here are are four of my favourite ways to transform said football into winning weeknight recipes.</p> \n<p><strong>To cook the batch of cauliflower</strong><br />2 medium cauliflowers (about 1300g) <br />1 Break the cauliflower into florets and discard the base of the stem. Trim away the tough outer leaves, reserving the smaller ones surrounding the head. Part boil the florets in salted water for 5 minutes. Drain in a colander and allow to steam dry for a few minutes, then tip on to kitchen paper or a clean tea towel.</p> \n<h2><strong>The tangy salad</strong><strong>: Cauliflower, sultana and pine nut salad with garlic yoghurt</strong><strong> (pictured above)</strong></h2> \n<p>This has to be my favourite way to eat cauliflower: the deeply savoury florets, crisp and charred at the edges, work amazingly with the plump, sweet sultanas.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 2-4</strong><br />400g cooked cauliflower and leaves<br />2 tbsp olive oil <br />1 red onion, cut into wedges <br />&frac12; tsp chilli flakes <br />75g sultanas <br />40g pine nuts <br />100g baby spinach leaves <br /><strong> </strong></p> \n<p><strong>For the garlic yoghurt </strong><br />200g Greek yoghurt <br />1 garlic clove, crushed <br />Juice of 1 lemon <br />Salt and black pepper</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Put the cauliflower on a large baking tray, drizzle with olive oil and roast for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, stir, then add the onion wedges, chilli flakes and cauliflower leaves to the tray. Roast for another 25 minutes. Five minutes from the end, add the sultanas and pine nuts and continue cooking.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Meanwhile, mix all the ingredients for the garlic yoghurt together with some seasoning and set aside.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Remove the cauliflower from the oven, allow to cool to room temperature then toss with the spinach leaves. Serve with the garlic yoghurt.</p> \n<h2><strong>The weeknight supper</strong><strong>: Cauliflower and mackerel nasi goreng</strong></h2> \n<p>The perfect weeknight food fix, this bowlful can be on the table in less than 20 minutes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ad4b09d5cec7a6a3b29a2c1487d896d3c4c15759\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435833262336/5056bb7f-8bd6-43b2-93b7-c59c25d02696-460x368.jpeg\" alt=\"nasi goreng\" width=\"460\" height=\"368\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">This fried rice dish will keep you full all evening and any leftovers can be packed up for lunch. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Serves 4 </strong><br />2 eggs, lightly beaten <br />1 garlic clove, crushed <br />4cm-piece ginger, peeled and grated<br />2 tbsp vegetable oil<br />1&frac12; tbsp nasi goreng paste<br />400g cooked cauliflower and leaves, roughly chopped <br />1 red chilli, chopped <br />6 spring onions, sliced <br />400g cooked rice <br />2 smoked mackerel fillets, flaked<br />1 tbsp light soy sauce<br />A small bunch of coriander, chopped<br />Salt and black pepper <br /></p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Mix the egg, garlic and ginger with some seasoning.

Food styling: Cara Hobday</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ideally at the weekends, I’ll be surrounded by friends – the ones who aren’t shy of a good lunch. And I can think of no better summer lunch dish than this, served with big bowls of summery veg. (You’ll need to start on the rabbit legs a day ahead; it’s all of five minutes’ extra work, but if you can’t face it, buy a big jar or tin of confit duck instead, though it won’t be quite the same.) There should be a gluggable red wine on the table, too, with a little chill on it. And lunch should go on – calmly – for hours. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>4 rabbit hind legs<br />Sea salt and black pepper<br />3 or 4 sprigs fresh thyme<br />Duck, goose or pork fat<br />Chicken and rabbit bones (or just chicken), with stock vegetables of your choice (leek, carrot, turnip, perhaps)<br />12 shallots, peeled but left whole<br />12 small turnips (if possible with tops, cut off but reserved)<br />12 baby carrots, green tops trimmed off</strong></p> \n<p><strong><br /></strong>For the a&iuml;oli<br /><strong>20 garlic cloves <br />Sea salt and black pepper<br />2 free-range egg yolks<br />At least 300ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />Juice of 2 lemons (you may not need it all, but it’s best to have it to hand)</strong></p> \n<p>First, confit the rabbit. In a plastic, glass or china container, scantily scatter salt, pepper and a couple of sprigs of thyme. Lay in the rabbit legs in a single layer and scatter more salt, pepper and thyme on top. Cover, then refrigerate for 24 hours.</p> \n<p>The next day, there should be a salty puddle in your container. Remove the legs and brush off any salt, pepper and thyme. Dry the legs with a clean towel, place in an oven dish or pan and add enough duck, goose or pork fat (or a combination) to submerge the legs. Cover with foil and cook in a medium oven until the flesh is giving but not falling apart – about two hours. Transfer the meat to a sealable glass, plastic or china container, then pour over the fat to cover. You can make this confit far in advance, in which case seal the container, leave it to cool, then refrigerate. Either way, make sure the legs are at room temperature before cooking them further.</p> \n<p>Make a stock with rabbit and/or chicken bones and the vegetables. Meanwhile, make the a&iuml;oli. Put the garlic in the chopping bowl of a food processor with a pinch of salt (this helps to break it up) and pepper, then whizz until finely pulped – this is important, because you do not want garlic chippings in the a&iuml;oli. With the motor running, add the egg yolks, let them meet the garlic for a moment, then slowly add the oil in a gentle stream. The emulsion should safely hold up to 300ml oil; at that point, take a view and, if you can, add a little more oil. Add lemon juice, tasting as you go, adjust the seasoning and refrigerate.</p> \n<p>Strain the stock into a pan, then bring to a boil and add the shallots. Cook for 10 minutes, then add the rest of the vegetables except the turnip tops. Cook for eight minutes, then reduce the broth to a gentle simmer. Lift the rabbit legs from their fat and use your fingers to scrape off any excess. Add the legs to the pot and let them gently heat through and soften. When they are hot and the vegetables are cooked, stir in the turnip greens and wait for them to wilt. Season to taste, then ladle into deep plates or shallow bowls, so a ladle of broth can be poured over each serving. Eat with the a&iuml;oli.</p> \n<p> <span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Fergus Henderson is chef/patron of <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com\">St John</a> and <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/spitalfields/\">St John Bread &amp; Wine</a>, both in London.</p> \n<p><strong>Fiona Beckett’s wine match </strong>Fergus is a bit of a Francophile, so I’m sticking with French wine here.

Food styling: Cara Hobday</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the kind of dish I’d make for a family lunch in Italy, particularly if we were in Sicily, where the red mullet is so good. I’d serve it with a bottle of <a href=\"http://www.planeta.it/en/schede_vino/cometa-doc-sicilia-fiano/\">Cometa</a>, from the Planeta winery, which would assist in my rejuvenating siesta afterwards. The dish is a little involved, true, but it’s worth the effort: the end result is as impressive to look at as it is to eat. If you buy whole fish and ask the fishmonger to fillet them for you, you should keep the bones for the stock (this will give the dish a more intense flavour) and the liver (to beat in right at the end, to enrich the dish); if you can get only fillets, just omit those two extra steps in the method – it’ll still be very tasty. As for the pasta, I’d use garganelli, which can be hard to come by in the UK; casarecce make a good substitute. Any self-respecting Italian would serve this as a separate pasta course, after some antipasti and before a simple whole fish; but hell, it’s summer, so there’s no harm in serving it as a main, perhaps with a green bean, roasted red onion and parmesan salad. Serves four, or six as a starter.</p> \n<p><strong>20g unsalted butter, at room temperature<br />4 small or 2 large red mullet fillets (if possible, ask your fishmonger for the head, bones and liver)<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />400g garganelli or casarecce<br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped<br />&frac12; glass white wine<br />4 tomatoes, blanched, skinned, deseeded and cut into eighths<br />3 tbsp good black olives, such as taggiasche, pitted<br />4 tbsp passata<br />1 bunch flat-leaf parsley, picked and finely chopped (use the stalks in the stock)</strong></p> \n<p>For the stock<br /><strong>1 tbsp olive oil<br />&frac12; carrot, peeled and cut into chunks<br />&frac12; onion, peeled and cut into chunks<br />1 celery stalk, cut into chunks<br />1 bay leaf<br />2 black peppercorns<br />Mullet heads and bones<br />&frac12; glass white wine <br />&frac12; tbsp tomato paste</strong></p> \n<p>First make the stock. Heat the oil in a pan, add the vegetables, bay leaf, peppercorns and parsley stalks, and sweat for a couple of minutes to soften, but not colour. Add the fish heads and bones and sweat until they start to stick to the base of the pan. Add the wine, leave to bubble until the alcohol has evaporated, then stir in the tomato paste and cook on a low heat for two minutes, taking care that the paste doesn’t burn. Add a little water – enough almost to cover, but not quite – bring to a boil, then turn down the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes. Pass through a fine sieve.</p> \n<p>If you’ve got the mullet liver, mash it, preferably with a pestle and mortar, though the back of a knife will do, then put in a bowl with the butter and mix until a uniform pink.</p> \n<p>Cut the fish fillets into strips and bring a large pan of salted water to a boil, ready for the pasta.</p> \n<p>Heat half the oil in a large saute pan. The idea is to cook the garlic (so that it is digestible) but not burn it (or it will be bitter), so here’s a cheffy trick: tilt the pan, making the oil flow to one side, and sweat the garlic gently in that for a few minutes, until it starts to colour – it’s far less likely to burn this way. Meanwhile, put the pasta on to cook.</p> \n<p>Add the mullet to the garlic pan (you can stop tilting now) and cook for a minute or two, until it starts to stick to the pan. Scrape it away and it will flake and crumble. Add the wine and about half a ladle of stock (save the rest for another day), leave it to bubble and reduce for a minute, then stir in the fresh tomato and olives. Mix in the passata and cook gently for two to three minutes more.</p> \n<p>Drain the pasta when it’s been boiling for a minute less than the time stated on the packet (ie, after five or six minutes): it needs to be drained well, almost dry, or it won’t take up the liver butter. Reserve some of the cooking water – in Italy, this is what we use to bring pasta sauces together.

I love getting together with friends and family in the garden, and serving up big bowls of exciting salads that everybody can get stuck into. This is one of my favourites. The candied aubergine puree is not at all difficult, but just leave it out if it’s not your thing.

Toss the diced aubergine for the marinade in the olive oil, then lay out on a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper and bake for around 15 minutes, or until cooked through with just a touch of colour. Turn down the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4, ready for the puree (if making). Leave the cooked aubergine to cool, then combine with all the other ingredients and leave to marinate in the fridge for at least four hours, and preferably overnight.</p> \n<p>To make the puree, combine all the ingredients except the cream and spread over a baking tray lined with greaseproof paper. Bake for about 25 minutes, until completely soft and with a little colour. While the mix is still hot, tip into a blender, add the cream and blitz smooth. Season to taste and set aside.</p> \n<p>To serve, spread a spoonful of puree on each plate (or put it all on one big platter; or on individual slices of toasted sourdough, a bit like bruschetta, and serve as part of a meze). Divide the leaves and the marinated aubergine between the plates. Place a few dots of yoghurt on all of them, scatter over a sprinkling of almonds, and serve.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Selin Kiazim’s restaurant <a href=\"http://www.oklava.co.uk\">Oklava</a> opens in London this autumn.</p> \n<p><strong>Fiona Beckett’s wine matches </strong>Respecting Selin’s Turkish-Cypriot heritage, you could go for a brambly Turkish red with this exotic dish – <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/anfora-trio-case-of-6/p/p60033143?OmnitureRedirect=anfora+trio\"><strong>Anfora Trio 2013</strong></a> (&pound;8, Marks &amp; Spencer; 14% abv) would do the trick.

Closer to home, David Gerran, bar manager of <a href=\"http://thewhipmayfair.co.uk\">The Whip in Mayfair</a>, has mixed this twist on the julep for me on many occasions, and I’ve coaxed the recipe from his chilled, minty fingers. The key to a great julep is in the careful handling of the mint. These drinks were originally served in pewter tins, but if you don’t have one, a tin camping mug works just fine (or, provided it’s got no sharp edges, the empty tin your apricots were in). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>1 tin apricots – you’ll need 25ml tinned juice for each serving<br />8 mint leaves, plus 1 extra to serve<br />50ml bourbon</strong></p> \n<p>Drain the apricots, saving the juice in a jug (eat the fruit separately – I like them with thick cream or ice-cream, which reminds me a bit of school dinners). Put the mint leaves in the empty tin, then squish into the sides and base of the tin with the back of a spoon: you want to impart a minty flavour over as much of the walls of the tin as you can. Pour in the bourbon, then fill the tin with crushed ice. Pour 25ml tinned apricot juice over the ice, and garnish with fresh mint. Sip slowly.</p> \n<h2><strong>Common or garden G&amp;T</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a8fbf80f8a4c173c563efdd1d6ef50bf7aaad820\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673613123/33654967-82e7-44b5-899c-45c3a92b4358-193x420.jpeg\" alt=\"G&amp;T\" width=\"193\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Best drunk propped up on one elbow while lying on a lawn.

Make more immediately.</p> \n<h2><strong>White Russian</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"705627e82a039d28bf4ae49919f2b9b0d2d22d6f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673199191/ed7bfad6-d294-4c16-9fcc-3723abd7420e-240x420.jpeg\" alt=\"White Russian\" width=\"240\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This simple cocktail gives the drinker a white moustache. Made famous by <a href=\"http://\">the Dude in The Big Lebowski</a>, white Russian has a creamy texture, obviously, and a sweet, boozy finish. I like to use <a href=\"http://www.blackcow.co.uk\">Black Cow vodka</a> here: it’s distilled from milk, so seems very fitting, plus it’s made in Dorset. Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>50ml Black Cow vodka<br />25ml Kahlua <br />25ml cream<br />Swizzle stick, to serve</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a tumbler with cubed ice. Add the vodka and Kahlua, and stir. Carefully pour on the cream – you want it to stay on top in a distinct layer – and serve with a swizzle stick.</p> \n<h2><strong>Strawberry, lemonade and mint</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"75c1b8e25d410e682e6ba8fd1c794ec8f85d9de7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673246934/c4694a0f-49ab-4a7b-b6fa-d25369b89498-202x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Strawberry cocktail\" width=\"202\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A thirst-quenching number with an almost sherbety finish for any alcohol-abstainers at your gathering (and also rather splendid dosed with a shot of vodka or gin). Per serving:</p> \n<p><strong>3 strawberries<br />125ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans Victorian lemonade</a> (or other cloudy lemonade)<br />1 small handful fresh mint<br />1 sprig fresh mint and 1 strawberry, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Put three strawberries in the base of a highball glass and muddle (ie, bash) until smooth. Add the handful of mint, gently muddle again, then top with lemonade and stir to mix. Top with ice and garnish with a sprig of mint and a whole strawberry.</p> \n<h2><strong>Honey sazerac</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"db6c3db5228d69d622a36e7cd6aa43edf2650ff8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673310086/deaae14e-aba0-4ae3-9f1c-567af9b10474-257x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Honey\" width=\"257\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A strong drop that makes a superb closer to an evening. I’ve used honey rather than the more usual sugar, because I find that gives a smoother finish; the dash of absinthe leaves a heady, aniseed coating on the glass. If you’re making a batch, serve from a jug with lots of ice, and sip from a set of chilled small cups or shot glasses. Sometimes drinking from tiny vessels gives a very different perspective on life. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>1 dash absinthe<br />50ml rye whisky<br />1 tsp honey<br />3 dashes Peychaud’s bitters<br />1 dash Angostura bitters <br />Lemon twist, to garnish</strong></p> \n<p>Swirl the absinthe and a little ice around your chosen drinking vessels. Put the whisky, honey and both bitters in a shaker, and stir to dissolve the honey. Add ice and stir again for 30 seconds. Tip out the ice and absinthe from the glasses (or drink it: no one’s watching) and fill with fresh ice. Strain the shaker into two glasses, squeeze a lemon twist over each drink and drop in.</p> \n<h2><strong>Storm in a teacup</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"589f2c30e7635eeeec63ec2b7672eb0e4a47c3ca\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673359286/6a9faf01-04fd-4332-a896-556fb6512bfa-291x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Storm in teacup\" width=\"291\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>This is essentially a dark’n’stormy served in a teacup: a perfect way to disguise daytime drinking. If anyone asks, it’s darjeeling. The rosemary adds a savoury, herbal note. Serves two.</p> \n<p><strong>100ml <a href=\"http://www.goslingsrum.com\">Gosling’s rum</a> <br />25ml lime juice<br />250ml <a href=\"http://www.fentimans.com\">Fentimans ginger beer</a><br />2 slices fresh lime<br />2 rosemary sprigs</strong></p> \n<p>Combine the rum, lime juice and ginger beer in a teapot with plenty of ice, and stir. Pour into teacups (saucers obligatory), and garnish with a slice of lime and a rosemary sprig.</p> \n<h2><strong>Marmalade punch</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bb11d732fcba6581bfd63e6514c1055bb4a3e8ba\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673403359/4ff25856-5ffd-4a88-b206-c4b5bfd67ff1-348x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Marmalade\" width=\"348\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Just the ticket for a summer party: it has a gentle heat, and the whisky, orange and ginger are all fitting companions. The overarching flavour is one of marmalade. If Paddington Bear were old enough to drink, and also not a bear, this would be his drink of choice. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>500ml cloudy apple juice<br />250ml Fentimans ginger beer <br />100ml whisky<br />2 dashes Angostura orange bitters<br />Juice of &frac12; lemon <br />8 slices orange</strong></p> \n<p>Put everything bar four slices of orange into a large jar or jug with lots of ice. Stir, pour into tankards, peg an orange slice to the side of each and swig. Dead posh, this.</p> \n<h2><strong>White sangria</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"86777cef50044ecf7b58438b0e38217cde1e36dd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673489268/5a77e0ab-c253-4730-afef-d510dc8b04de-285x420.jpeg\" alt=\"white sangria\" width=\"285\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>A gorgeous, fruity number in which the basil draws the drink towards a more aromatic and savoury conclusion. Thoroughly grown-up. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>6 strawberries<br />30g sugar<br />1 750ml bottle sauvignon blanc<br />Juice from 1 lemon<br />1 small apple, sliced<br />1 small handful fresh basil leaves</strong></p> \n<p>An hour ahead, cut the strawberries in half and sprinkle with sugar: the sugar will draw out flavour and form a syrup. Combine everything in a large jug, making sure to scrape in all the sugary strawberry juice, top with ice and stir. Serve in chilled tumblers or rocks glasses.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jackabevan\">Jack Adair Bevan</a> is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.theethicurean.com\">The Ethicurean in Bristol</a>.

aren’t about spending hours at a hot stove; they should be planned to give you the space to catch up with friends and family, gossip and kick back. Much of the work involved in this summery menu can be done in advance. All you have to do when your guests turn up is chuck a couple of ingredients on the barbecue and toss together a salad. That leaves you plenty of time to enjoy being outside as much as possible. Have fun.</p> \n<h2><strong>Grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7431b8da468f23e6cbdd701b01b8b697042df51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435682683820/a9176f92-f820-4d11-bbbe-7c605c8a9775-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds: ‘A perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Halloumi is a wonder ingredient, and at its best when introduced to some heat, ideally flame. Here, slices of halloumi are whipped straight from the barbecue to the platter (it doesn’t do sitting around very well), then tossed with juicy peaches, wafer-thin ribbons of courgette and almonds fried in butter. It’s a perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors. Serves six to eight.</p> \n<p><strong>6 small courgettes<br />4 peaches, peeled, stoned and cut into thickish wedges<br />1 big handful mint leaves, roughly chopped<br />Juice of 1 large lemon<br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />20g butter<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />50g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped<br />&frac14; tsp paprika <br />500g halloumi, cut into 1cm-thick slices</strong></p> \n<p>Light the barbecue an hour before you want to eat (failing that, use a griddle pan). Peel the courgettes into long, thin strips with a vegetable peeler, rotating them as you do so and stopping before you get to the seedy centre (keep the middles for stewing in olive oil for a soup or side dish the next day). Put the ribbons in a salad bowl with the peach wedges, mint, lemon juice and three tablespoons of oil, toss gently but thoroughly and set aside.</p> \n<p>Put a small frying pan on a medium heat, add the butter and season generously. Swirling the pan constantly, melt the butter and cook for two to three minutes, until it starts darkening. Add the chopped almonds and paprika, cook for another minute or two, until the butter is a dark, biscuity colour and the almonds are golden, then scatter over the salad.</p> \n<p>Rub the slices of halloumi in the remaining tablespoon of oil, then lay on the hottest part of the barbecue (or on a heated griddle pan). Grill for 30-60 seconds on each side, until char marks appear and the cheese softens. Cut each halloumi slice in half, toss into the salad and taste: you may want a scrunch of black pepper, a sprinkling of sea salt, a squeeze more lemon or a touch more olive oil. Adjust accordingly and serve at once.</p> \n<p><strong>Barbecued rabbit (or chicken) with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f5933327bd4f4f84001da3641c975c1790570dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683145236/ea3b7813-2416-484d-a2aa-b7db15f5dcfc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli: ‘Sensational.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve used free-range farmed rabbit here, which is really tender and tasty, but skin-on chicken thighs or even a whole spatchcocked chicken will work just as well. The combination of the black, herby rub, sweet tomatoes and garlicky mayonnaise is sensational. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>3 bunches fresh thyme, 1 bunch picked and finely chopped<br />1 bunch fresh mint<br />5 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped <br />Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 farmed rabbits, jointed into 8 pieces (or chicken thighs)<br />80ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 punnets cherry tomatoes, halved<br />A few splashes red-wine vinegar </strong></p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli<br /><strong>2 egg yolks<br />1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed to a paste with a little salt<br />1 tsp Dijon mustard<br />750ml mild olive oil <br />Juice of &frac12; lemon</strong></p> \n<p>Put the barbecue on about an hour before you want to eat. Put two dry frying pans on a medium-high heat and divide between them two of the bunches of thyme and the mint. Dry-toast the herbs, shaking the pan every so often, until they have blackened and the room is smelling fragrant – about 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Put two-thirds of the garlic, the chopped thyme and a big pinch of salt in a mortar and bash with a pestle until you have a green paste (or use a food mixer). Pull the leaves from the burnt herbs, add these to the mortar and bash again until broken down and thoroughly mixed in. You should now have a blackish rub. Season generously, transfer to a large bowl and mix in the lemon zest. Add the rabbit pieces and rub them all over with the marinade.</p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli, put the egg yolks, garlic, mustard and a generous pinch of salt into a food processor and blitz briefly. With the motor running, very slowly drip the oil through the funnel of the processor, until the mayonnaise starts to thicken and emulsify, then pour in the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream. Loosen with lemon juice and a few tablespoons of water, season to taste and transfer to a bowl.</p> \n<p>Put the oil and the rest of the garlic in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Once the garlic begins to bubble in the oil, cook for a minute or two to soften, then stir in the tomatoes and season generously. Cover with a lid, turn the heat right down and poach gently for 10 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened. Season with the vinegar to taste, and set aside.</p> \n<p>Once the barbecue is ready (ie, when you can hold your hand over the coals for only about five seconds before it gets too hot for comfort), put the rabbit legs and shoulders on the grill. After five minutes, add the belly pieces and, five minutes later, the ribs and saddle. Turn the pieces frequently until charred all over, brushing them with any leftover marinade as they cook – it should take 15-20 minutes from start to finish. (To check that the meat is done, cut into a thick piece.) Pile the cooked rabbit on to a large plate, squeeze over some lemon juice, then spoon on the juicy tomatoes, followed by the a&iuml;oli. Serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26d235d0cb1ebf1d305499af9aa58c0efbe7239d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435744594796/393c318f-2ca4-4d4d-9391-486a1afcee3f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: 'Low in gluten.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: ‘Low in gluten.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This delicious cocoa-rye pastry comes from <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tartine-2.html\">Chad Robertson’s amazing book Tartine 3</a> (&pound;24.99, Chronicle Books). It gives the sweet cardamom custard a crisp, grown-up, dark chocolate edge. It’s also very low in gluten. Serve with a bowl of fresh raspberries alongside. You’ll need a 26cm tart tin. Serves 12-16.</p> \n<p>For the cocoa-rye pastry<strong><br />500g unsalted butter<br />200g caster sugar<br />1 large egg plus 1 yolk, at room temperature<br />&frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />280g rye flour, sifted<br />170g cocoa powder, sifted, plus extra for dusting</strong></p> \n<p>For the cardamom custard<strong><br />350ml whole milk<br />350ml double cream<br />6 cardamom pods, seeds crushed<br />Seeds from 1 vanilla pod<br />10 egg yolks<br />120g caster sugar</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. To make the pastry, beat the butter and sugar with a paddle mixer until soft and a pale cream colour – this will take a few minutes. Beat in the whole egg, then the yolk, and stop the mixer. Scrape down the sides and beat in the vanilla, followed by the flour and cocoa, until thoroughly combined. Transfer the pastry to a large piece of clingfilm, pat into a rectangle and refrigerate for at least an hour, until firm.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the custard. Put the milk, cream, cardamom, vanilla seeds and pod into a saucepan and bring to simmering point. Simmer gently for three minutes, then set aside for 10 minutes to infuse. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, until light and pale. Discard the vanilla pod, then whisk the warm milk into the eggs and pour into a jug.</p> \n<p>Divide the dough in two and freeze half for another day. Dust both sides of the remaining dough lightly with cocoa powder and roll out between two large pieces of baking paper or clingflim, rotating as you do, until it’s an even thickness of about 4mm. Carefully roll the pastry on to the rolling pin and transfer to a 26cm tart tin. Press firmly into all the corners of the tin, leaving an overhang of roughly 0.5cm. Trim off any excess dough.</p> \n<p>Freeze the pastry case for 15 minutes, then line with baking paper, fill with baking beans and blind bake for 20 minutes, until slightly puffed up. Remove the paper and beans, and bake for 10-15 minutes longer, until the case is completely cooked (take care not to burn it, so check after 10 minutes).</p> \n<p>Turn down the oven to 140C/285F/gas mark 1. Run a sharp knife along the edges of the tart shell to neaten it, then pour in the custard, filling it up right to the brim. Bake in the centre of the oven for about 50 minutes, until just set – it shouldn’t wobble in the centre when you gently shake the tin. Leave the tart to cool completely, and serve with fresh raspberries.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of

recipes: The big tang theory","trailText":"Buttermilk provides a quick, sweet-and-sour dough perfect for honey‑glazed doughnuts and blueberry soda bread buns","standFirst":"<p>Put on your lab coats – there’s mad science at work in this week’s bakes. Acidic buttermilk reacts with bicarbonate of soda to form a quick, sweet-and-sour dough perfect for honey‑glazed doughnuts and blueberry soda bread buns</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>Apart from in the occasional American-style pancake or spruced up scone, buttermilk rarely gets a chance to shine in our cooking. It’s a shame, because its bright tang is the ideal foil to the kind of sickly sweetness and heaviness that baking’s so prone to. It’s also good at keeping cakes perfectly tender, while its acidity – when set off with a pinch of bicarbonate of soda – gives a good rise and light, open crumb. Put it to good use in a glazed cake doughnut or a sweet, blueberry-studded morning roll.</p> \n<h2><strong>Buttermilk doughnuts with a honey glaze</strong></h2> \n<p>Because they are made with baking powder, these doughnuts are far easier and less temperamental than their yeasted cousins. These are closer to the kind of doughnuts you find heaped into grease-stained bags at the funfair and on the seafront than the round sort, plump with custard, chocolate or jam. They’re light and spongy when freshly cooked – far softer than bread doughnuts, and richer too.<br /></p> \n<p>Deep-frying is scary the first time you try it – particularly if you don’t have the luxury of a deep-fat fryer – but give it a go and you’ll find it surprisingly quick and straightforward, if you work carefully. Just make sure you have a sugar thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil, and keep small hands far away from the action during the frying (there’s plenty for kids to help with during the rolling, stamping and, later, the dunking stages).</p> \n<p><strong>Makes 10-12</strong><br />1.5-2 litres cooking oil<br />300g plain flour<br />60g soft light brown sugar<br />3&frac12; tsp baking powder<br />&frac12; tsp bicarbonate of soda<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />A pinch of nutmeg<br />1 large egg<br />150ml buttermilk<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br /><strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p><strong>For the glaze</strong><br />75g unsalted butter<br />300g icing sugar<br />3 tbsp water<br />6 tbsp runny honey<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />A pinch of salt</p> \n<p>1 First, prepare the glaze. Melt the butter over a low heat. Stir the icing sugar and water together until a thick paste forms, then add the honey, vanilla extract and salt. Whisk in the melted butter until smooth. Set aside in a large bowl (one wide enough to dunk the doughnuts in later).</p> \n<p>2 Pour the cooking oil into a large pan (not nonstick) to a depth of at least 9cm. Do not to overfill the pan. Heat the oil until it’s 180C/350F; use a sugar thermometer to monitor the temperature. Don’t leave the oil unattended while it’s heating. Once it’s up to temperature, turn the heat right down, or even off, to prevent it from smoking.</p> \n<p>3 While the oil heats, prepare the dough. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the egg, buttermilk and vanilla together in a separate bowl before adding this mixture to the dry ingredients. Stir together to get a sticky, malleable dough.</p> \n<p>4 Dust a work surface with plenty of flour, then empty the dough on to it. Pat the dough out to a thickness of roughly 1cm (you can use a rolling pin if you want, but I find it easier just to use my hands here), flouring it as you go to minimise sticking. Cut out 8cm circles using a pastry cutter, then use a smaller 3-4cm cutter or appropriately sized lid to stamp out the small holes in the middle of each doughnut. It’s up to you whether you gather up these doughnut holes to make more doughnuts or just fry them as they are.</p> \n<p>5 Fry the doughnuts in batches of 3 or 4, cooking them for 1 &frac12; minutes on each side. Once cooked, pat dry on a piece of kitchen towel to soak up any excess oil, then, while they’re still warm, dip them in the glaze, coating one or both sides. Leave to cool and set on a wire rack, then repeat the frying and glazing with the remaining doughnuts. These are at their best when they’re freshly cooked, but you can revive them the next day (if they last that long) by warming them in the microwave or a low oven.</p> \n<h2><strong>Blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns</strong></h2> \n<p>Chelsea buns, sticky cinnamon swirls, dough wrapped in toasted pecans and chocolate chips … sweet buns are as good as baking gets, but they’re not ideal if you’ve got an impatient sweet tooth. Too often the thought of a lengthy knead and slow prove sends me careering towards the biscuit tin instead in my laziness. This is a recipe that sidesteps all that hassle, using a quick buttermilk dough instead of the usual bread sort, so you can have these ready, from storecupboard to table, in under an hour. They’re great for breakfasts because they’re not too sweet, but just as good as an afternoon snack.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 12</strong><br />300g plain flour <br />75g wholemeal flour<br />125g caster sugar<br />1&frac12; tsp baking powder<br />1 tsp bicarbonate of soda<br />1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />50g poppy seeds<br />Zest of 2 lemons<br />300ml buttermilk<br />400g blueberries<br />150g icing sugar<br />Lemon juice</p> \n<p><br />1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 20x30cm roasting dish or baking tin with baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Stir the flours, 100g of the caster sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in the poppy seeds and lemon zest. Pour in the buttermilk and work the ingredients together using a wooden spoon until a rough, slightly sticky dough forms. If the mixture feels very floury or crumbly, add a drop of milk.</p> \n<p>3 Dust the work surface with flour and roll the dough out to a rectangle roughly 50x30cm, flouring the rolling pin as you go. Scatter the blueberries all over the surface of the rectangle and pat them gently into the soft dough. Dust over the remaining 25g of caster sugar.</p> \n<p>4 Roll the rectangle up from long edge to long edge to give a roll roughly 50cm long, pinching the dough a little as you reach the end to help it stay securely rolled. Trim off the ends, then cut into 12 equal slices. Arrange these rolls in the prepared dish, spacing them equally and leaving a couple of centimetres between each to allow them room to rise.</p> \n<p>5 Bake for 25-30 minutes, until they’re fat, firm to the touch and mottled with juice from the blueberries. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze: stir the icing sugar together with enough lemon juice to give a thick, but pourable icing.</p> \n<p>6 Once the buns are cooked and still hot from the oven, brush them liberally with the lemon glaze and leave to cool a while in their tin. These are at their best when still slightly warm. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"What is the most underused ingredient in British baking?\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/untitled_form_19_copy_12_copy_21\" title=\"COOK July 4 Ruby Bakes\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435832402955/a81f43f5-3fdd-4674-8ecd-2bae300eefbf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"Blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns (left) and sticky doughnuts.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-04T05:00:07Z","lastModified":"2015-07-04T05:00:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":41,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/buttermilk-recipes-doughnuts-blueberry-soda-bread-buns","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aazj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/buttermilk-recipes-doughnuts-blueberry-soda-bread-buns","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/buttermilk-recipes-doughnuts-blueberry-soda-bread-buns"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435832402955/a81f43f5-3fdd-4674-8ecd-2bae300eefbf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Buttermilk provides a quick rise and moist texture to these blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns (left) and sticky doughnuts.

Being the child of a North American myself, cooking my way through these dishes reminded me of my own childhood, from camping on the shores of the Great Lakes to being snowed in, and not minding one bit as long as there were cookies. My own memories made me realise that, although American food is well-established in the UK, there are still so many great recipes that somehow aren’t yet quite as common across the pond ...</p> \n<p>Clairetweet brings us funnel cakes – deep-fried, squiggly pancakes that can be found at US fun fairs. They are much like British mini-doughnuts, and every bit as moreish when fresh out the fryer. ColonialCraving’s buttermilk biscuits were similarly addictive; a crisp crust, soft crumb and salty-sweet edge, topped liberally with butter. And of course, there had to be a cookie recipe in here. The Minnesota munchers from Jackie Pieterick have a caramel depth courtesy of a smattering of melted Daim bars. And, if it’s an authentic 4 July-style cookout you’re after, look no further than Thom O’Dwyer’s classic macaroni salad.</p> \n<p>I’ve relished the eating and cooking of every recipe this week, but, in the end, I feel that if you’ve never eaten a sloppy joe, then... well, you’re missing out. Yes, it’s beef mince, in a burger bun, but for some reason, it’s one of the most fun things you’ll ever eat. This classic recipe is slightly sweet with smoky notes from barbecue sauce and could not be simpler to make. This is the kind of feed-a-crowd food that will never fail to please. What’s more American than that?</p> \n<h2><strong>The winning recipe: sloppy joes</strong></h2> \n<p>What could be more American than a sloppy joe?

They are nothing more than pancake batter, cooked in 3-5cm of oil instead of a frying pan.

Baking these in something with quite deep sides will really help to support the biscuits as they rise.</p> \n<p>2 Sift together the flour and raising agents into a large mixing bowl, then mix through the salt and sugar. Cut the butter into small pieces and lightly rub it through the flour mix. It doesn’t have to be too uniform.</p> \n<p>3 Add the cream and buttermilk – a bit at a time, as you may not need all of it – and bring it all together with a fork to form a soft dough. Don’t overmix the dough or you’ll get tough biscuits. I use a fork to mix it so that my hands don’t warm up the mixture either.</p> \n<p>4 Turn the dough out on to a lightly floured surface and pat it out to about 1cm thick. Fold it in half, then pat it out again. Fold it one more time and pat it out again so that it’s 1 cm thick. Stamp out 5cm discs using a pastry cutter It’s very important that you don’t twist the cutter though. Place the biscuits in the buttered cake tin. Brush the tops with a little extra melted butter, sprinkle with black pepper and bake for 15-20 minutes.</p> \n<p>5 For the compote, use a small saucepan to combine all of the ingredients. Gently simmer them until the juices begin to thicken and become syrupy. Try not to stir the compote too much – you don’t want to mush up the fruit. Leave the compote to cool completely before serving it with the still-warm biscuits.</p> \n<h2><br /></h2> \n<h2><strong>Minnesota munchers</strong></h2> \n<p>This recipe is adapted from a 1970s Lutheran Church Ladies cookbook and replaces toffee bits with crushed Daim bars, which suits Minnesota’s Swedish roots.<br /><em>Jackie Pieterick, Wolverhampton</em></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 24</strong><br />240g butter, softened<br />270g brown sugar<br />2 medium eggs<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />300g plain flour<br />1 tsp baking powder<br />200g milk chocolate chips<br />200g dark chocolate chips<br />100g white chocolate chips<br />5 x 28g Daim bars, crushed into bits</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.

If you want to liven up breakfast with something more interesting than OJ and fizz, there are endless variations: add a dash of Angostura or orange bitters, or elderflower or lime cordial; try pink or red grapefruit juice; or abandon the citrus and use apple, pear, cherry, pomegranate, strawberry or cranberry juice.
