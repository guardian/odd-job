The most important part of this recipe is cooking the duck breast from cold, which helps render the fat (melt and release it from the breast), creating a lovely crisp skin.<br /></p> \n<p>(serves 2)</p> \n<p>2 duck breasts, patted dry </p> \n<p>1 tsp five spice powder </p> \n<p>2 tsp fine salt </p> \n<p>1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil </p> \n<p>&frac12; cucumber, deseeded and chopped into batons </p> \n<p>5 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced </p> \n<p>hoisin sauce, to serve </p> \n<p>Chinese pancakes, to serve</p> \n<p>Put the duck breasts skin-side down into a dry frying pan over a medium-high heat. As the pan heats, the fat will begin to melt and collect – tip out the excess fat as it forms. Leave the breasts to cook for 8–10 minutes, by which time they should be deeply golden and crisp, so flip them over. If the skin is not crisp, continue cooking until it is. </p> \n<p>When you are happy with the duck breasts, remove them from the pan and carefully wipe the pan clean with some kitchen paper. Mix the five spice powder and salt and use to season the duck breasts all over. </p> \n<p>Heat the oil in the frying pan over a medium-high heat, then return the duck to the pan, flesh-side down. Fry the breasts for a further 4 minutes, before flipping them on to the skin side again and cooking for another 2 minutes. Remove the breasts from the pan, and leave to rest for at least 4 minutes. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/13/grilled-sesame-prawn-toast-recipe\">Grilled sesame prawn toast</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While the duck is resting, set out all the garnishes – cucumber, spring onion and hoisin sauce – and warm your pancakes. I find the best way to do this is in the microwave, but if you don’t have one you can gently steam them wrapped in baking parchment and then in tin foil. When ready to serve, cut the duck breasts into thin slices, and serve to your nearest and dearest. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436872352146/0f1fabdc-5900-4fe4-b9c1-6cbf2c9528d0-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kris Kirkham","altText":"Easy crispy duck, from Homemade Takeaways by Rob Allison.

Make the most of them, advises Nigel Slater","standFirst":"<p>There are so many really good, reasonably priced avocados around right now, so make the most of them</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<h2>The recipe</h2> \n<p>Warm a couple of tablespoons of olive oil in a nonstick frying pan then add four plump, lightly spicy sausages (about 300g), such as the fennel-seed freckled Italian salsiccia, and let them cook for 20 minutes over a low to moderate heat. Keep an eye on their progress and turn the sausages regularly so that they colour evenly.</p> \n<p>Peel, halve and stone two perfectly ripe avocados. Put the flesh in a mixing bowl, then, using a spoon or fork, roughly crush to a coarse and lumpy texture. Chop a small handful each of coriander and parsley leaves (you need about 2 tbsp of each) and add to the avocado. Halve and finely chop a jalape&ntilde;o or other moderately hot chilli then add to the herbs and avocado.</p> \n<p>Coarsely crumble 200g of feta into the bowl, then gently fold the cheese, chillies, herbs and avocado together. Pour 3 tbsp of olive oil over it and divide between two plates. When the sausages are cooked, cut them into thick slices and add to the avocado and feta cream. Enough for 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>Cook your sausages slowly. This way they will brown evenly and their skins won’t split. If you want, use a spoonful of the hot sausage fat from the pan as a further dressing for the avocado cream. This is a dish to eat as soon as it is made, but if you need to keep the avocado cream for more than a few minutes, add a dash of lemon juice to stop it discolouring.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>The choice of sausage is up to you, but a fairly spicy one is good with the cooling avocado. Chorizo is particularly good if you yearn for something more spicy. You could add tomatoes, cored and diced.</p> \n<p><br />Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436277697195/Sausages-with-avocado-and-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Feta accompli: Nigel Slater's sausages with avocado and feta recipe.

With its multiple long, thin stems sprouting from a swollen, globe-shaped base, it looks very weird indeed, like something from outer space.</p> \n<p>For something so odd-looking, however, its flavour is very mild-mannered and neutral. If you’ve never tried kohlrabi, do give it a go. It belongs to the cabbage family and, eaten raw, tastes a bit like a mild sweet radish or cauliflower stalk. Thinly shaved, or cut into batons or dice, and added to a slaw or stir-fry, kohlrabi is crunchy and refreshing, with a little peppery kick for added interest. I love to eat young kohlrabi raw at this time of the year, and slow-cook the larger bulbs in the colder months, especially in a creamy gratin.</p> \n<h2><strong>Kohlrabi and lime salad</strong></h2> \n<p>Possibly the most amount of flavour packed into one of the shortest recipes I’ve ever written. Serves four, generously.</p> \n<p><strong>3 small kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 5mm x 5cm batons (500g net weight)</strong><br /><strong>2 granny smith apples, peeled and cut into 5mm x 5cm batons</strong><br /><strong>2 green chillies, deseeded and julienned</strong><br /><strong>15g picked coriander leaves</strong><br /><strong>15g picked mint leaves</strong><br /><strong>10g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 spring onions, trimmed and thinly sliced</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp black sesame seeds</strong><br /><strong>Finely grated zest of 1 lime, plus 2&frac12; tbsp lime juice</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp groundnut oil</strong><br /><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>80g creme fraiche</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp sesame oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong></p> \n<p>Put all the ingredients apart from the creme fraiche and sesame oil in a big bowl with three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Stir well, then divide between four plates. Spoon creme fraiche on top, followed by a little drizzle of sesame oil, and serve at once. (See, simple.) </p> \n<h2><strong>Spicy aubergine with kohlrabi and coconut</strong></h2> \n<p>Serve this with warm naan bread or poppadoms, and maybe some plain rice. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>120ml sunflower oil</strong><br /><strong>1 medium kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 5cm-long and 1cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>2 large onions, peeled and cut into 2cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>3 aubergines, cut into 7cm-long and 3cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>&frac34; tsp turmeric</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp ground cumin</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp black mustard seeds</strong><br /><strong>4 whole sprigs fresh curry leaves (about 30 leaves)</strong><br /><strong>2 large tomatoes, cut into 2cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>80g fresh coconut, finely grated (ie, the flesh from roughly half a small coconut)</strong><br /><strong>220g Greek yoghurt</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp lime juice</strong><br /><strong>20g coriander leaves, roughly chopped</strong></p> \n<p>For the spice paste<br /><strong>4 large stalks lemongrass, woody ends and outer layer removed and discarded, very finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>6cm piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>6 fresh kaffir lime leaves</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, roughly chopped </strong><br /><strong>1 dried red chilli, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 small banana shallot, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>90ml sunflower oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put all the spice paste ingredients apart from the oil in a food processor. With the motor running, slowly add half the oil and process until you have a paste, stopping the machine and scraping the sides of the bowl as you go. Set aside (the remaining three tablespoons of oil will be used to fry the paste later). </p> \n<p>Heat a tablespoon and a half of oil in a large-heavy based saucepan or saute pan for which you have a lid, and put on a medium-high heat. Add the kohlrabi and cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until it starts to soften and turn a dark golden-brown. Tip into a large bowl.</p> \n<p>Pour another tablespoon and a half of oil into the pan, add the onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden-brown. Add to the kohlrabi bowl.</p> \n<p>Add the last of the oil to the pan and fry the aubergines for 15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until soft and golden-brown, but still holding their shape. Stir in the turmeric, cumin and a teaspoon and a half of salt, cook for two minutes, then add the mustard seeds, cook for a minute and add to the kohlrabi bowl.</p> \n<p>Wipe clean the pan and put on a medium-low heat. Add the reserved oil from the spice paste and, when hot, add the paste and fry gently for about 25 minutes, stirring often, until it takes on a nice golden colour. Add the curry leaves and tomatoes, cook for five minutes, then add the fried vegetables and 400ml cold water. Cover and cook on a low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>To serve, divide the curry into bowls and scatter with coconut. Put a spoonful of yoghurt on each portion (serve the rest on the side), add a squeeze of lime and a sprinkling of coriander, and serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Kohlrabi kimchi</strong></h2> \n<p>Kimchi is an acquired taste, but those who enjoy it, myself included, tend to find it addictive, and eat it with just about anything: grilled meat, seafood, or just spooned over a bowl of rice. The longer you leave the kimchi, the more the flavours develop – it will keep in the fridge for several months. Makes about 900g.</p> \n<p><strong>3 large kohlrabi, peeled, cut in half horizontally and then into 5mm-thick slices</strong><br /><strong>12 spring onions, trimmed and cut into 4-5cm slices</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp caster sugar</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>3cm piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp nanami togarashi (Japanese assorted chilli pepper)</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp fish sauce</strong></p> \n<p>Put the kohlrabi and spring onion in a large bowl with the sugar and two teaspoons of salt. Mix and set aside for 45 minutes, stirring once or twice. Drain off any moisture that has leached from the vegetables and add the garlic, ginger, nanami togarashi and fish sauce to the bowl. Mix to combine, cover with cling-film and put somewhere dark and cool for two days. Transfer to a clean airtight container and store in the fridge.</p> \n<h2><strong>Fritti misti</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4710d3ad15dcfcc1ef7744828a635b027bd6526\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436870538672/fab8b17f-00d7-46d9-9826-de174e03bda8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi’s fritti misti recipe\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s fritti misti: ‘My version of a dish at San Francisco’s legendary Zuni Cafe.’ Food styling: Emily Kydd.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louis Hagger for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is my version of a dish at San Francisco’s legendary <a href=\"http://www.zunicafe.com\">Zuni Cafe</a>. Use a mandoline, if you have one, to slice the vegetables as thin as they need to be. You can use any seasonal veg you fancy; most will work really well, just as they do for tempura. The batter’s good with seafood, too. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>120g plain flour</strong><br /><strong>120g semolina</strong><br /><strong>1&frac14; tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed</strong><br /><strong>1&frac14; tbsp whole aniseed, roughly crushed</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>400g buttermilk</strong><br /><strong>1 litre sunflower oil, for frying</strong><br /><strong>1 medium kohlrabi, peeled, trimmed and cut into 5mm-wide rounds</strong><br /><strong>1 medium desiree potato, peeled and cut lengthways into 3mm-wide rounds</strong><br /><strong>1 small fennel bulb, trimmed and cut lengthways into 5mm-wide slices </strong><br /><strong>1 lemon, cut into 2mm-thick slices, plus 4 lemon halves for squeezing</strong><br /><strong>20 large sage leaves</strong><br /><strong>40g capers, rinsed and patted dry</strong></p> \n<p>Put the flour, semolina, coriander, aniseed and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt in a shallow bowl. Mix well and set aside. Pour the buttermilk into a separate shallow bowl.</p> \n<p>Pour the oil into a large saucepan and put on a medium-high heat for five to six minutes, until it reaches 160C (if you have one, use a probe or thermometer to check). While the oil is warming, dip the kohlrabi a slice at time into first the buttermilk and then the flour, just so it’s roughly covered. Once all the kohlrabi is battered, carefully drop the slices into the oil in batches of about eight and fry for two to three minutes, turning once halfway through, until golden-brown on both sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a wire rack lined with kitchen paper; transfer to a medium oven to keep hot while you repeat with the remaining kohlrabi.</p> \n<p>Batter and cook the potato, fennel, lemon and sage in the same way: the potato and fennel will take two to three minutes, the lemon one to two minutes and the sage only about 30 seconds. Don’t worry if they are not evenly covered by the batter: the finished dish looks better if you can see some of the vegetable through the crisp coating.</p> \n<p>Once all the vegetables are fried, add the capers to the oil (ie, don’t dip them in the buttermilk and flour first) and fry on a medium heat for a minute, until they open up like flowers and go crisp.

I decided to make jelly. There is something entirely frivolous about the idea of setting fruit juice so that it wobbles on your spoon. No one needs jelly. It is there simply to amuse and delight. Making jelly is escapist cooking. Like trifles, whim-whams and blancmanges, they are there simply for fun.</p> \n<p>The stone fruits – particularly peaches, nectarines and apricots – are in fine fettle at the moment. I bought flat white peaches this week that smelled like roses, and apricots that had an almost wine-like scent. The peaches ended up in a softly set jelly of elderflower cordial; the apricots were warmed with a splash of orange, then crushed and embedded in juice set with very little gelatine. A grown-up version of the much-loved mandarin-orange jelly of my childhood.</p> \n<p>Take it easy on the sugar and pick your fruits wisely – redcurrants or blackcurrants, stone fruits, rhubarb or oranges – and you get an extraordinary clarity of colour and vibrancy of flavour. (The acidity in currants can affect the set, so a few more sheets of gelatine are required.) Leaf or sheet gelatine, the sort that comes in paper envelopes rather than as fine powder in sachets, is the sort I prefer. It is a doddle to use. Just soak the leaves in cold water for five minutes until they have collapsed and softened, then lift the result out of the water and stir it into warm juice or a mixture of juice and wine. It really couldn’t be easier.</p> \n<p>I make mine the day I intend to eat them, giving them a maximum of six hours in the fridge. Any longer, even overnight, and they firm up just a little too much. In my book, a jelly should quiver rather than bounce.</p> \n<h2>Apricot jelly</h2> \n<p>Ripeness is all with this fruit, but if you are working with less than perfect specimens, as is sometimes the case, cook them for a few minutes longer than in the recipe below, sweetening them with a tablespoon or so of caster sugar.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>apricots</strong> 500g<br /><strong>orange juice</strong> 500ml (6 medium oranges)<br /><strong>leaf gelatine</strong> 12g (6 sheets)<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>double cream</strong> 250ml<br /><strong>rose petals</strong> (optional)<br /></p> \n<p>Finely grate the zest of one of the oranges on to a plate and set aside.</p> \n<p>Cut each apricot in half, discard the stone, then put the fruit in a medium-sized saucepan. Pour in 4 tbsp of the orange juice and let the apricots cook, partially covered with a lid, for 10 minutes or until they are vivid in colour and soft enough to pure&eacute;.</p> \n<p>Crush the apricots with a fork, so they are part way between chopped fruit and pur&eacute;e. Spoon the fruit into a shallow serving dish, about 22-24cm in diameter.</p> \n<p>Soak the gelatine leaves in a bowl of cold water, pushing the leaves under the water one at the time to prevent them from sticking.</p> \n<p>Warm the orange juice in a saucepan, but do not let it boil. Remove the gelatine from the water – it should be a squishy lump – and stir it into the hot orange juice. When the gelatine has completely dissolved, pour over the crushed apricots and allow to cool. Transfer to the fridge and leave for a couple of hours to set.</p> \n<p>Put the grated orange and the sugar into a food processor and blitz for a few seconds, until the sugar has turned a pale-orange colour. Alternatively crush the sugar and orange zest together using a pestle and mortar. Stop when the zest has lightly coloured and perfumed the sugar.</p> \n<p>To serve, softly whip the cream (not so stiff it can stand in peaks) and place in spoonfuls around the edge of the dish. Decorate with the orange-scented sugar and, if you wish, a few rose petals.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cf26e4f00e85758825d705f75f03ba12df8bfb52\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436276511359/de69118e-dbe7-4453-afcd-b4f644b09ef5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"White peach and elderflower jelly with a sprig of elderflower in a small glass bowl\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Pick your fruits wisely and you get an extraordinary clarity of colour and vibrancy of flavour,’ says Nigel Slater.

They are less fragrant, but their colour makes up for it. I have included a spoonful of sugar in this recipe as I feel that, despite the sweetness of the elderflower cordial, the jelly benefits from it. Leave it out if you prefer.</p> \n<p>Makes 4<br />For the peaches:<br /><strong>white peaches</strong> 125g<br /><strong>lemon</strong> juice of <strong>&frac12;</strong><br /></p> \n<p>For the jelly:<br /><strong>leaf gelatine</strong> 10g (6 small sheets) <br /><strong>elderflower cordial</strong> 100ml<br /><strong>white wine</strong> 350ml<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 1 tbsp (optional) <br /></p> \n<p>Half-fill a mixing bowl with cold water then add the sheets of gelatine. If you do this one at a time, it will prevent them from sticking together. Leave the gelatine to soften for 10 minutes, in which time it becomes a clear, spongy mass.</p> \n<p>Pour the elderflower cordial and white wine into a medium-sized saucepan, add the sugar (or not, if you prefer a sharper jelly) and warm over a moderate heat. Don’t let the mixture boil, which would affect the gelatine’s setting qualities.</p> \n<p>Cut the peaches in half then into thin slices, discarding the stone as you go, then toss them gently in the lemon juice to prevent them from browning. Divide the peaches among four small serving dishes.</p> \n<p>Lower the softened gelatine into the warmed cordial and wine, then stir until it has dissolved. It should disappear almost instantly. Pour into a jug then into the dishes to cover the peaches, then refrigerate for about four hours, until lightly set.</p> \n<p><br />Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436276258550/April-jelly-decorated-aro-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Soft on fruit: Nigel Slater's apricot jelly recipe.

The dry winds of summer that can crisp a lawn in a day are gone. Instead the suburbs and gardens are lush. The wattle is in flower, blooms cascading over fences in a riot of yellow. Flowering gums are heavy with nectar, and violets make their appearance in cool dark corners of gardens. Often where nothing else will grow, the violet will thrive, making a carpet of soft, dark green leaves, and at this time of year dainty purple flowers. </p> \n<p>Violets, pansies and violas all have edible blooms. Pansies and violas have varying degrees of dark velvety faces or blotches on the petals – viola being the genus name, as well as the flower. (The African violet is another thing entirely and should not be eaten.) The tender, new leaves of violets can be used in salads, as well as the blooms themselves. <br /></p> \n<p>In Melbourne the violets are blooming now, and for this recipe we picked violets from the garden, in the morning, when the blooms were just opened, plump and fresh. The distinctive white and purple bloom of the Australian native violet is also edible, and can be treated in the same way as the purple violets in the recipe given below, but they flower towards the warmer months of the year. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2c9fe791f8fc6c6a3c7f0793bc8fd4db7eeca90\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a2c9fe791f8fc6c6a3c7f0793bc8fd4db7eeca90/0_0_2362_1418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Violets are blooming now.

Firstly make sure you have properly identified the blooms, and secondly make sure your flowers are pesticide free. Don’t pick from roadsides, instead from your own or a known garden is best. Beware of eating flowers from florists as you don’t know how the flowers have been treated. An exception would be purchasing from an organic flower producer. </p> \n<p>The sugared violets retain their delicate scent and the taste is sweet and floral. It is much more subtle than a sugared rose petal, but still distinctive.

Who doesn’t like the lovely yellow stuff? It’s an absolute cinch to make and improves just about every dessert. However, that’s all it’s really good for. Luckily the clever French came up with cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re (literally “pastry cream”) – a thickened, more stable version of custard that is much better for baking with. You can make a big batch at the weekend, then keep it wrapped in your fridge until you’re ready to use it – it’ll last five days. It can also be used as the base for fruit in tarts, piped into profiteroles or spread between layers of cake.</p> \n<p><strong>To make the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re<br /></strong>Don’t panic if it goes a little lumpy; just keep stirring and it will eventually become smooth and silken. If all else fails, however, pass through a sieve.</p> \n<p><strong>Makes about 1.6kg</strong><br />1 litre whole milk<br />300ml double cream<br />1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped<br />12 egg yolks<br />240g caster sugar<br />40g cornflour<br />40g plain flour<br />Icing sugar, to dust</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Put the milk, cream, vanilla pod and seeds in a large heavy-based pan and bring up to the boil. Keep an eye on it as it can easily boil over. Immediately turn down to a simmer and let it bubble away for 3 minutes.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Meanwhile, whisk together the yolks and sugar until pale and light, then whisk in the flours. Take the milk off the heat and allow to cool for a minute or so. Discard the vanilla pod.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Slowly whisk about a third of the warm milk into the egg mix, then pour that into the milk pan and return to a low heat. Whisking constantly, slowly return to the boil, allowing it to bubble for 1 minute only. You’ll find that it’ll thicken almost immediately. Turn the heat down and continue to whisk for another couple of minutes to cook out the flour. It may start off a bit lumpy, but continue whisking and it’ll soon become smooth. Immediately transfer to a large baking dish or your largest Tupperware, smooth the top, sprinkle the surface with icing sugar (this prevents a skin forming), then leave to cool.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/feb/18/custard-tart-brits-portugal-pasteis-de-nata\">Custard tart fight: can the British version ever compete with Portugal’s past&eacute;is de nata?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>The teatime treat: easy Portuguese custard tarts</strong></h2> \n<p>Quick and simple to whip up – the key is not to faff around with pastry too much: the warmer it gets, the less it tends to behave. These are very similar to the Portugese version, just with added cinnamon swirling in the pastry.</p> \n<p><strong>Makes 12</strong><br />A small knob of butter<br />300g pre-rolled puff pastry, cold<br />1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />1 heaped tsp caster sugar<br />450g cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re <br />100g whole milk<br />Icing sugar, to dust</p> \n<p><strong>1 </strong>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Generously butter a 12-hole muffin tray. Cut the pastry in half across the middle, then sprinkle one half evenly with the cinnamon and the sugar. Put the other half on top, then roll out again into a sheet the same size as the original sheet. Roll up tightly like a swiss roll, then cut into 12 even slices. Roll each slice into 10cm-diameter discs, then press into the muffin tray and stab a few times with a fork.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Transfer the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re into a saucepan and place over a medium-low heat. Whisk in the milk until mixed – the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re will become very lumpy but will become smooth again with some brisk whisking and a little heat. Allow to cool for 5 minutes.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Spoon the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re into each pastry, filling them right up to the brim (it may seem like too much, but it will rise and deflate). Dust each one with a little icing sugar. Put in the oven for 35-45 minutes until the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re has a few dark spots and the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool in the tin completely before serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>The summer bake: cherry and custard cake</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4b8c5a8e83b4024fd6e1d5992df0916e497dfe72\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436440831759/79518991-5003-42de-be82-bd64829f4fc8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cherry and custard cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cherry and custard cake: like a summer party in your mouth.

You can always substitute the cherries with other fruit if you wish: blackberries would be great, as would raspberries or blueberries.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 10</strong><br /><strong>For the cherries</strong><br />45g soft brown sugar<br />400g cherries, stoned and halved<br />1 tbsp butter, plus extra for greasing</p> \n<p><strong> For the cake</strong><br />150g soft brown sugar<br />150g butter, at room temperature<br />3 eggs<br />150g plain flour<br />4 tbsp ground almonds<br />1&frac12; tsp baking powder<br />350g cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line and grease a 21cm cake tin with butter.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> For the cherries, put the sugar and 1 tbsp of water in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and cook for a moment until it begins to bubble and the sugar has dissolved. Stir in the cherries and butter and cook for a few minutes until the fruit begins to soften, then take off the heat.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> For the cake, cream together the sugar and butter until pale and light. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then fold in the flour, almonds and baking powder.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Pour a third of the batter into the tin, spread it out with a wet table knife, then dollop over teaspoonfuls of the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re and spoon the cherries on top, leaving behind the juices (use for a cocktail!). Spoon the remaining batter over the top, spread again with a wet table or palette knife and put in the oven for 60-70 minutes. Cover it with a little baking paper after 50 minutes or so if it’s turning a little too brown. A skewer put in the centre should emerge clean if it’s done. Leave to cool in the tin before serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>The classic dessert: peach, raspberry and custard trifle</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75ad43ecb7215422c6779309631e139e19b14346\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436440928006/62021d78-0dd1-496a-9398-fccdbba3ff41-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Peach, raspberry and custard trifle\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peach, raspberry and custard trifle may be retro, but that doesn’t mean it’s not zingy. Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite being embarrassingly retro, trifle is still a brilliant dessert, with its colourful layers and different textures. It takes just a few minutes to assemble and sits in your fridge happily, so is a great last-minute or do-in-advance pud. This version is inspired by the wonderful peach melba, but you can of course use whatever fruit you have at hand, such as plums or just berries.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 8</strong><br />4 peaches<br />40g caster sugar<br />2 tbsp floral honey<br />200ml sweet white wine (water works just as well)<br />200g raspberries, plus a few reserved for decoration<br />220g shop-bought madeira cake or leftover sponge cake<br />400g cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re <br />300ml double cream<br />50g toasted flaked almonds</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Peel the peaches first: Put the fruit in a large bowl and cover with boiling water. Leave for 2-3- seconds, then scoop out and immediately cool under running cold water. Use a small knife to remove the skins, remove the stone and cut the fruit into eighths. Put to one side.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Put the sugar, honey and wine in a large pan and simmer over a medium-low heat until the sugar dissolves. As it begins to simmer gently, add the peaches and cover with a round piece of baking paper. Leave the peaches to continue simmering for 7-8 minutes until just tender, then scoop out and place at the bottom of your trifle bowl. Return the pan to the heat and boil the syrup for 8-10 minutes to reduce it, then pour it over the peaches and leave to cool.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Once the peaches are cool, spread the raspberries on top in an even layer. Cut the cake into 1cm-thick slices then place on top of the raspberries. Spoon the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re over the cake slices. In a large clean bowl, whisk the double cream until you have soft peaks, then spoon it over the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re , working from the outside in (this will prevent the cream sinking into the custard). Chill it in the fridge for an hour.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Scatter the almonds on top and decorate with a few reserved raspberries before serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>The moreish morsel: Spanish leche fritta with cinnamon</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d70928a964210ce704f472e4b584d197553b00d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436441015031/f33c0bde-58e5-4b0f-b68f-5cb9b3dc5522-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Spanish leche fritta with cinnamon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spanish leche fritta with cinnamon – if fried custard seems strange, that’s only because you’ve not tried it.

The key to this is that the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re is chilled enough, as it won’t hold together if too warm. Deep-frying can be terrifying at home, but using a wok somehow makes it less stressful. A jam thermometer is also very useful in this situation.</p> \n<p><strong>Makes 8 pieces (serves 4)</strong><br />400g cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re , chilled<br />Vegetable oil, for frying<br />100g plain flour<br />1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />100g caster sugar</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Cut the cr&egrave;me p&acirc;tissi&egrave;re into 50g/5 x 5cm cubes and keep chilled in the fridge until you need them.</p> \n<p><strong>2 </strong>Place a wok or a deep, heavy-based pan over a medium-high heat and add enough oil to come 4cm up the sides. Heat until a thermometer registers 180C or until a cube of bread turns golden in 45 seconds.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Sprinkle the flour over a large plate and mix the cinnamon and sugar on another plate. Prepare a third plate with kitchen paper for draining the leche fritta when it comes out the oil.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Working in batches of 4 squares at a time, coat each square in the flour, then very carefully lower into the hot oil and cook for 60-90 seconds until golden, then scoop out, leave to drain for a second on the kitchen paper and very gently toss in the cinnamon sugar mix before serving.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>The Kitchen Cooperative – Georgia Levy and Benjamin Benton – are caterers, consultants and cooks.
