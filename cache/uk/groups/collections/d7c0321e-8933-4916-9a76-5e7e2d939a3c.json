Dissolve the yeast in the water and add the oil. Now make a well in the middle of the flour and pour in the yeast mixture a little at a time, mixing constantly. We like to do this by hand, squelching out the lumps as they appear.</p> \n<p>When all the yeast mixture has been incorporated, transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead well for at least 5 minutes. If the dough is still sticky, add a little more flour; if it is stiff, a little more water. It is ready when no longer tacky but soft, elastic and smooth. Put the dough back in the bowl, cover with a cloth and leave to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk – approximately 1-2 hours.</p> \n<p>While the flatbread dough is proving, make the toppings.</p> \n<p>For the spinach topping, heat the oil in a large saucepan over a medium heat. Add the chopped onion and a pinch of salt and fry, stirring occasionally, for 15 minutes or until the onion is golden and sweet. Add the oregano or marjoram and fry for a few seconds, then add the spinach a handful at a time. Give the spinach a quick stir and cook for a few minutes, until tender. Set aside to cool and drain in a colander, then chop roughly. Stir in the currants and taste the mixture for seasoning. Set aside the pine nuts and anchovies for later.</p> \n<p>For the onion, red pepper and aubergine topping, first toss the aubergine with the salt and set aside. Heat the olive oil in a heavy saucepan about 25cm wide and, when hot but not smoking, add the onions with a pinch of salt. Give them a good stir, and cook over a medium heat for about 15 minutes, stirring every now and then. Add the peppers and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the onions are golden and sweet and the peppers soft. Be sure to stir them often so they cook evenly and do not stick to the bottom of the pan. Blot the aubergine dry, add to the pan along with the rosemary and cook for a final 15 minutes, stirring often, until the aubergine is soft all the way through. Remove from the heat and drain off any excess oil. Check for seasoning and set aside to cool.</p> \n<p>To make and bake the cocas, preheat the oven to its maximum setting. Divide the dough into 4 balls, and roll the first one out very thinly to make a 20 x 30cm oblong. Place it on a large baking sheet (aluminium is best) and spread half of one of the fillings evenly over the surface, right up to the edges of the dough. The spinach cocas should be topped with the pine nuts and anchovy fillets, if using, and the spinach pressed down and drizzled with a little extra oil to stop it burning. The onion, red pepper and aubergine topping is ready to go as soon as it has been spread on the dough.</p> \n<p>Bake for 10-15 minutes, until browned and crispy underneath. While one coca is in the oven, start rolling and topping the next one. They are great served piping hot straight from the oven, or at room temperature.</p> \n<p><em>From Moro East by Sam &amp; Sam Clark (Ebury Press RRP &pound;17). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/moro-east.html\"><em>Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;14 </em></a> </p> \n<h2>Colman Andrews’s black rice</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ac1b3b2844b21cde37e53e2f148e173080cd418\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435159008520/f26659dd-b0ff-4b1d-87f4-20342926bf13-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Black rice\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a recipe for which you should splurge on the best and the freshest possible seafood. Even fresh cuttlefish is available in some parts of Britain, though it is hard to find. It is not the same thing as squid, exactly. Its flesh is thicker and sweeter, and its ink is richer in flavour. Nonetheless, fresh squid (and squid ink) may be substituted – or you could use a combination of canned Spanish cuttlefish (sold in some Spanish shops), for its ink, and fresh squid.</p> \n<p>The ink sac in both cuttlefish and squid is a little silver-grey pouch located beneath the tentacles. It is easy to find, but treat it gently so that it doesn’t break.</p> \n<p>With the growing popularity of Italian-style black rice and black pasta, cuttlefish or squid ink has recently become available in small jars or plastic pouches (like soy sauce at Chinese take-away places). The quality of such ink is fine – but why pay for something (and it’s generally quite expensive) that comes free with the cuttlefish or squid itself? If you are using such ink, substitute about 2 teaspoons of it for the ink called for in this recipe.</p> \n<p>Serves 6 as a main<br /><strong>cuttlefish</strong> 1 medium-sized (about 250g) or <strong>squid</strong> 2-3 large, cleaned and cut into small pieces, with ink sac(s) set aside (see above)<br /><strong>olive oil<br /></strong><strong>onions</strong> 2, chopped<br /><strong>tomatoes</strong> 2, seeded and grated or peeled, seeded and chopped<br /><strong>monkfish</strong> 500g, cut into 6 pieces<br /><strong>mussels</strong> 12, cleaned<br /><strong>prawns</strong> 6 large, shells on<br /><strong>short-grain rice</strong> 650g<br /><strong>fish stock</strong> 1.25-1.5 litres<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 2 cloves, finely chopped<br /><strong>parsley</strong> 2 sprigs, finely chopped<br /><strong>salt</strong></p> \n<p>Cook the cuttlefish or squid in a cassola, flameproof casserole or large frying pan in a small amount of olive oil until just done (about 2-3 minutes).</p> \n<p>Add the onion, with more oil if necessary and cook until soft; then add the tomato and cook, stirring well, until it has almost dissolved.</p> \n<p>Add the remaining fish and shellfish to the cassola and mix in well.</p> \n<p>Place the ink sac(s) in a sieve, hold it over the cassola and crush sac(s) with the back of a spoon. Pour a few tablespoons of water through the sieve to extract more ink.</p> \n<p>Bring the fish stock to a boil; then reduce to a simmer.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, add the rice to the cassola and stir well so that all grains are coated with oil and ink.</p> \n<p>Slowly add the fish stock, stir well and bring to a boil. Add the garlic, parsley and salt to taste; then reduce the heat and cook on very low heat, uncovered, for 15-20 minutes or until all the liquid is absorbed but the rice is still creamy.

Toast the bread on the cut side. Put four heaped tablespoons of good mayonnaise in a mixing bowl, season it with black pepper and with the finely grated zest of a small lemon. Reserve the lemon. Finely slice four large radishes and put them in a mixing bowl. Trim three spring onions, discarding the tough, darker stalks, then cut the rest into small pieces and add to the radishes. Drain 100g of crayfish tails or prawns and roughly chop them. Wash a handful of watercress, discard any tough stalks, then add to the radishes together with a trickle of olive oil and a little sea salt and toss the mixture gently. Cut each half of the ciabatta into two. Spread the lemon mayonnaise over it, then divide the crayfish salad between them. Serves 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>There is no second slice of bread under which to hide your filling. An open sandwich needs to be made at the last minute if it is to tempt. Keep the flavours light and fresh, and pick out only the most perfect of young salad leaves and herbs.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>What you need on the toasted bread is a mixture of fresh seasonal salad and shellfish, and something to hold them in place. Use a classic mayonnaise or one seasoned with crushed, roasted garlic; or maybe a herb mayonnaise scented with tarragon or basil.

If the weather allows, we cook it on an open fire – you are rewarded with an amazing smoky aroma. This paella recipe is the fruit both of my own investigations and those of top Valencian chefs and grandmothers. Follow this recipe and I guarantee you will soon be tasting the best paella. Buen provecho!</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>globe artichokes</strong> 2-3 (depending on the size), cleaned and trimmed<br /><strong>saffron</strong> 1g<br /><strong>salt</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>Spanish olive oil</strong> 8 tbsp<br /><strong>chicken pieces (on the bone) </strong>400g<br /><strong>rabbit pieces (on the bone)</strong> 400g<br /><strong>runner beans</strong> 200g, trimmed and cut into 2&frac12;cm pieces<br /><strong>broad beans or fresh white butter beans </strong>100g<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 4, finely chopped<br /><strong>tomatoes</strong> 1 large or 2 small, grated<br /><strong>sweet piment&oacute;n</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>water or light chicken stock</strong> 2 litres<br /><strong>Spanish rice</strong> 500g, such as calasparra or bomba<br /><strong>rosemary</strong> 1 sprig</p> \n<p>First prepare the artichokes. Trim the stalks and peel away the outer leaves so you are just left with the artichoke hearts. Scrape away any furry choke with a teaspoon, then run a lemon half over the hearts so they don’t discolour.</p> \n<p>Wrap the saffron in foil and toast it for 30 seconds on each side in a paella pan over a medium heat. Remove from the pan and set aside.</p> \n<p>Increase the heat to the maximum and season around the edges of the pan with the table salt. Wait until the pan is really hot and then drizzle with the olive oil. It should start smoking immediately; at this point throw in the pieces of chicken and rabbit (the meat needs to absorb the salt at this early stage). Fry the meat until nicely browned on all sides (this will add to the flavour of the paella).</p> \n<p>Add the runner beans and broad beans and stir together for 1 minute before adding the garlic. Cook for 1 minute and then add the grated tomatoes (discarding the skin), piment&oacute;n and toasted saffron. Cook for 4 minutes, stirring all the time, until you can see that the tomatoes have lost most of the juice and changed colour.</p> \n<p>Add the water or chicken stock and leave to simmer for about 20 minutes, allowing the bits of caramelised chicken and vegetable on the bottom of the pan to dissolve so you get a rich stock. If you use chicken stock instead of water you will only need to simmer for 5 minutes. Check the seasoning but bear in mind that the rice will absorb a lot of saltiness, so it’s okay if it tastes quite salty at this stage.</p> \n<p>Cut the artichokes into quarters and add to the pan – if you add them any earlier the entire paella will turn dark in colour. Add the rice, spreading it evenly over the paella pan and stir just once. Cook on the highest heat for about 10-12 minutes before reducing the heat right down and cooking for a further 5-7 minutes. Once you have added the rice and given it a good stir you shouldn’t touch the pan with a spoon again. You need to keep the film that develops on the top of the stock from breaking, otherwise the steam will escape and the rice won’t cook evenly.</p> \n<p>When the water is at a lower level than the rice itself, add the rosemary sprig. If the layer of rice on the top starts to look a bit crispy, cover the paella pan with a layer of newspaper for the last 5 minutes of cooking. This will help to steam the grains on top while the bottom gets crispy. In Spain this crispy bottom layer, the ‘socarrat’, is the most valuable part of the paella. Once the paella is finished it should look like a completely flat layer of rice. Leave to rest for 5 minutes before serving.</p> \n<p><em>From Tapas Revolution by Omar Allibhoy (Ebury, RRP &pound;20). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tapas-revolution.html\"><em>Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;16</em></a><em>; </em><a href=\"http://www.tapasrevolution.com\"><em>tapasrevolution.com</em></a></p> \n<h2>Colman Andrews’s prawns with garlic and paprika</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ef74bbb0398420a0def21a2cbbe6b8bc9be0cff\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435158614551/768b73b4-337b-47e0-8879-b6cbc2633335-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Prawns with garlic and paprika\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This particular dish, served at one of the better traditional restaurants in Valencia, El Plat, is made with llagostins, a variety of prawn known scientifically as Penaeus caramote – a particularly large and meaty species.

You can prepare the croquettes ready for frying the day before and keep them in the refrigerator.</p> \n<p>Makes about 30 croquettes<br /><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 75g<br /><strong>onion</strong> &frac12; large, peeled and finely chopped<br /><strong>jam&oacute;n serrano or other raw dry-cured ham </strong>200g, finely chopped (this can be done in the food processor)<br /><strong>nutmeg</strong> freshly grated, a pinch<br /><strong>whole milk</strong> 725ml<br /><strong>plain flour</strong> 150g<br /><strong>salt</strong> if necessary<br /><strong>fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs</strong> about 100g<br /><strong>medium matzo meal or breadcrumbs</strong> about 125g<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 2 large<br /><strong>sunflower or olive oil </strong>for deep-frying, enough to cover the croquettes</p> \n<p>In a large pan, melt the butter and gently saute the onion over a low heat until it is soft. Add the ham and cook, stirring for a minute or so. Then stir in the nutmeg and about half the milk and bring to the boil.</p> \n<p>Beat the flour with the remaining milk using an electric mixer until any lumps have disappeared. Then pour into the pan, stirring vigorously, and cook, continuing to stir constantly, for 8-10 minutes until the mixture has the consistency of a thick paste that comes away from the bottom of the pan. Add salt if necessary – it might not need it because the ham is salty. Chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.</p> \n<p>To make the croquettes, cover a large plate with plenty of very fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs and a second plate with medium matzo meal or breadcrumbs. Beat the eggs lightly in a soup plate. Two large spoons greased with oil are normally used to shape the croquetas into an oblong. But you may find it easier, as I do, to take lumps of the thick bechamel paste the size of walnuts and roll them into balls between the palms of your hands. You can rub your hands in oil if you do not want the paste to stick. As you make them, drop the balls into the fine matzo meal or breadcrumbs. Roll a batch of the balls in the fine meal until well covered all over, then roll them in the beaten egg, and then in the medium matzo meal. This will give them a nice thick crust.</p> \n<p>To deep-fry the balls in batches in a frying pan, heat the oil until it is only medium hot (until a piece of bread dropped in sizzles immediately but does not turn dark quickly). Carefully lower the croquettes into the oil and fry over a medium-low heat for 5-6 minutes until lightly browned, turning them over once. If the oil is too hot they will burst.</p> \n<p>Lift them out with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. They are best eaten right away.</p> \n<p><em>From The Food of Spain by Claudia Roden (Michael Joseph, RRP &pound;30). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/food-of-spain.html\"><em>Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;25 </em></a></p> \n<h2>David Eyre’s bacalao a la malague&ntilde;a</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55a02849f540040b393664f23f914411f37a1430\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435158710765/95b77f91-2617-4dc7-a993-8c696587fec7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bacalao a la Malaguena\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Serves 4 as a starter<br /><strong>salt cod</strong> 400g, dry weight, the thicker the better, soaked in two or three changes of water, in the fridge, for about 48 hours<br /><strong>new potatoes</strong> 300g<br /><strong>your best olive oil</strong> 150ml<br /><strong>oranges</strong> 4, peeled and sliced as thinly as possible, reserving any juice<br /><strong>ground black peppercorns<br /></strong><strong>strong black olives</strong> 20<br /><strong>red pepper</strong> 1, roasted, peeled and torn into strips<br /><strong>red onion</strong> 1 small, very thinly sliced into rounds and then soaked in cold water for 10 minutes<br /><strong>picked parsley and/or mint leaves</strong></p> \n<p>Either poach the cod in water until barely cooked and then flake it, dicarding the skin and bones, or tear the uncooked cod into strips.

You can identify the fish by the stripes on the first dorsal fin and, when fresh, three or four yellow streaks along its sides. Its profile is slightly more elongated and less snub-nosed than its cousin.</p> \n<p>Buy the biggest specimens you can find – no tiddlers please. Each fish should weigh around 400g prior to filleting. Get your fishmonger to fillet them for you – each fish will give you two fillets of around 100g each.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>potatoes</strong> 3 medium, peeled<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil</strong> 5 tbsp<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 2, chopped<br /><strong>thyme</strong> 1 sprig, leaves stripped<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>Arag&oacute;n or Kalamata black olives</strong> 30, pitted<br /><strong>chive stalks</strong> 10, chopped<br /><strong>red mullet</strong> 4 x 400g, filleted<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> for frying</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6. Slice the potatoes as thinly as possible (use a mandolin if you have one), then mix with 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the chopped garlic and thyme leaves. Season, then spread the mixture over a greased baking tray. Bake for about 15 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, blitz the olives and half the chive stalks with the remaining olive oil in a food processor to make a thick puree.</p> \n<p>Season the fillets. Heat some oil in a frying pan until it is medium hot – the oil should be shimmering but not smoking – and fry the mullet for 2 minutes skin-side down, then turn over and fry for another minute. You want a crispy skin.</p> \n<p>Divide the potatoes between four plates, pop two fillets on top of each mound and, using a teaspoon, drizzle the plate with the olive puree.

Make a spicy salad instead: peel, de-pith, and roughly chop a grapefruit into chunks, then Tupperware up. Pick a handful of mint leaves, wrap in slightly damp kitchen towel and pack on top of the grapefruit. Make a dressing by mixing 1 chopped and deseeded birdseye chilli with the juice of ∫ lime, 1 crushed garlic clove, a pinch of sugar and a splash of fish sauce, and store in a mini jam jar. Combine everything just before eating. If you ever stumble across those crispy dried onions in the supermarket, they are a fine finishing touch. </p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Dice 8 baby plum tomatoes, a quarter of a cucumber (deseeded), 2 spring onions and 6 radishes. Add to an air-tight container. Wash and pick the leaves of a small bunch of parsley and wrap in kitchen towel. Make a dressing by adding the juice of half a lemon, a half-tbsp of pomegranate molasses, a splash of olive oil, salt and black pepper to a small container. Toast a pitta until crisp and wrap in a piece of kitchen towel. Assemble everything at lunch: add parsley (snip with a pair of clean scissors pilfered from the stationery cupboard), dressing, and mix together, then add the pitta last (rip it into shreds). </p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Try a very simple crispy kale and chicken salad: poach a chicken breast in water and bake some kale, drizzled in a little olive oil and sprinkled with paprika, in a hot oven for 10 minutes. Add a few lovely boiled new potatoes with chives, if you want to make it more substantial.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435232663422/4ea6b366-5bd6-4ec2-9089-8163a0c47259-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Hennie Haworth for the Guardian","altText":"Not just for breakfast: pack a grapefruit salad and a tangy Asian dressing for lunch.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Hennie Haworth for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T09:00:14Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T09:00:14Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":44,"contributors":[{"name":"Sophie Missing","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sophie-missing"},{"name":"Caroline Craig","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caroline-craig"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style","Salad"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/salad","webTitle":"Salad"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"The lunch box","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/the-lunch-box"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/29/how-to-make-a-lunchtime-salad-exciting","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a5fk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/29/how-to-make-a-lunchtime-salad-exciting","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/29/how-to-make-a-lunchtime-salad-exciting"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435232631301/e3d8b18b-500b-4609-9d3c-4f87eb0cbc22-1020x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Not just for breakfast: pack a grapefruit salad and a tangy Asian dressing for lunch.

Pork belly is cheap to buy and when cooked well can be exquisite, but you can use pork loin if you prefer. Ask your butcher to score the skin of the belly, or do it yourself with a Stanley knife (the cuts should be no more than 1cm apart and be deep enough to cut through the rind to form crackling).</p> \n<p>Serves 4-6<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 2, crushed with a pinch of salt<br /><strong>ground fennel seeds</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>organic or free-range pork belly</strong> 1.5kg, in one piece, skin on and scored<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>fino sherry or white wine</strong> 150ml<br /><strong>a splash of water</strong> (optional)<br /><strong>sea salt and black pepper</strong></p> \n<p>Mix the garlic with the fennel seeds and rub over the flesh of the belly. Place on a large board, skin-side up, and dry the skin thoroughly. Generously sprinkle with fine sea salt (about 1 tbsp) all over the scored skin. Leave for half an hour, then dust off excess salt.</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 230C/gas mark 8. Transfer the pork to a large roasting tin greased with the olive oil and place in the hot oven on the top shelf. It is important that the oven is really hot to start with, as this intense heat is required to blister the skin and turn it into crackling. Roast at this high heat for a good 30 minutes until hard crackling has formed, then turn the heat down to 190C/gas mark 5 and transfer to a clean roasting tin. Continue cooking for another 2-2&frac12; hours (35 minutes if loin) until the meat is soft and tender. Remove from the oven, transfer to a chopping board and leave to rest, loosely covered with foil to keep warm, for 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the gravy. Pour off any excess oil, and place the roasting tray on the hob on a low to medium heat. Deglaze with the sherry or white wine, scraping the juices off the bottom of the pan as you go. Simmer for a couple of minutes to reduce the alcohol, then taste for seasoning. If it tastes too strong, add a splash of water. Keep hot. To serve the pork we often take it off any ribs beforehand as it is easier to slice.<br /><em>From Moro The Cookbook by Sam &amp; Sam Clark (Random House, RRP &pound;20).</em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/moro-cookbook.html\"><em> Click here to buy it from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;16</em></a></p> \n<h2>Nieves Barrag&aacute;n Mohacho’s classic tortilla</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6715d04777e5e44ca964c4f66e335371cf43dd67\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435157392129/2499a8f9-9f99-4689-8aec-9467d366fef9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Classic tortilla Barrafina\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Romas Foord for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A mandolin, if you have one, is best for slicing the potatoes.</p> \n<p>Serves 4 as a tapa or light lunch<br /><strong>vegetable oil</strong> 650ml<br /><strong>potatoes</strong> 750g, peeled and sliced into &frac12;cm rounds<br /><strong>onions</strong> 600g, peeled and sliced into very thin half-moons<br /><strong>free-range eggs</strong> 6<br /><strong>Maldon salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>olive oil </strong>1-2 tbsp</p> \n<p>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, heavy-bottomed pan until it is just beginning to smoke.

Sprinkle some flour on a clean work surface and roll out the pastry to a 3mm thickness. Cut out discs from the pastry about 12cm in diameter and transfer onto a floured tray. Repeat the process with the leftover pastry: you should end up with 12 discs of pastry. Transfer to the fridge to chill.</p> \n<p>Prepare your filling. For the cumin and paprika-spiced chicken and spinach, heat a saut&eacute; pan over a low heat and add a lug of olive oil. Add the paprika and cumin and cook gently for 1 minute. Add the spinach, season and cook until fully wilted. Drain the spinach, cool and roughly chop.

Brush some egg wash on one half of the border and pull the other half over the top of the filling to meet the eggy side.</p> \n<p>Press down and seal the pastry, ensuring there are no gaps. You will have a half moon shape with a bulge of filling in the centre. The pastry is quite robust but will become warm with too much handling, so you should work fairly swiftly. Crimp the sealed edge with a fork to give the classic empanadilla finish. Brush all over with egg wash and pop in the fridge for at least 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>Bake the empanadillas on a floured, non-stick oven tray for 15-20 minutes until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is piping hot – a knife inserted into the centre of the empanadilla will come out hot.

Remove from the oven and transfer the tomatoes, onions and the roasting juices to a blender or food processor.</p> \n<p>Break the garlic into cloves then squeeze the soft, inner flesh of each clove into a small dish. Add half the garlic to the tomatoes and reserve the other. Process the onions and tomato mixture until you have a coarse pur&eacute;e. Season with the vinegar, salt and black pepper and set aside.</p> \n<h2>Caramelised onions, chillli toasts and goat’s curd and basil oil</h2> \n<p>For the caramelised onions:<br /><strong>onion </strong>1, large<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>golden caster sugar</strong> 2 tsp<br /><strong>red-wine vinegar</strong> 1 tbsp, mellow<br /></p> \n<p>Peel and finely slice the onion, then cook it for a good 15-20 minutes in the olive oil in a small pan. Keep the heat low to moderate stirring regularly, so that the onion softens then starts to caramelise. Scatter the sugar over the softened onion, let the sugar melt then, just as it starts to turn brown, stir in the balsamic vinegar.</p> \n<p>For the chilli toasts:<br /><strong>butter</strong> 50g<br /><strong>red chilli </strong>1, medium sized<br /><strong>ciabatta</strong> 4 slices<br /><strong>sea salt flakes</strong><br /></p> \n<p>Melt the butter in a small pan. Halve, seed and finely chop the chilli, then stir it into the butter. Using the oven at 200C/gas mark 6 or an overhead grill, toast the ciabatta on one side then place them on a baking sheet, uncooked side up and spoon over the chilli butter. Toast until the butter starts to sizzle and the bread colours, then sprinkle with sea salt flakes and serve with the soup.</p> \n<p>For the goat’s curd and basil oil:<br /><strong>goat’s curd</strong> 4 heaped tbsp<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 150ml<br /><strong>basil</strong> 20g<br /><strong>roasted garlic</strong> 5 cloves<br /></p> \n<p>Pour the olive oil into a blender or food processor, add the basil leaves and the garlic cloves and a pinch of salt, then process to a brilliant green oil. Pour into a small jug or bowl.</p> \n<p>Serve by ladling the soup into bowls, pass around plates of the hot chilli croutes, a bowl of the goat’s curd and a jug or bowl of basil oil. Add a large spoonful of curd to the soup, a spoonful of the onions, then trickle over some of the basil oil. Float the croutes in the soup as you serve.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa72ab1a7a01daefd697c3ba551f5387e6081b2f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435057136572/df1f84de-5610-4f3b-a69b-99ad407ea8d0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roast tomato soup with pancetta, mussels, tarragon oil and lemon croutons.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the red: roast tomato soup with pancetta, mussels, tarragon oil and lemon croutons.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Pancetta, mussels, tarragon oil and lemon croutons</h2> \n<p>For the tarragon oil:<br /><strong>parsley</strong> 15g<br /><strong>tarragon leaves</strong> 10g<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 150ml<br /></p> \n<p>Put the parsley leaves, tarragon and olive oil in a blender.

But fresh beets that you have cooked yourself are a world away from the dodgy pickled sort, and brighter, firmer, and more full of earthy flavour than those (admittedly convenient) ready-cooked, vacuum-packed numbers. They’re adaptable, too: as happy in wedges as they are grated or whizzed into a puree.</p> \n<p>Grappling with fresh beets can leave your kitchen looking a little bit like an episode of CSI. Luckily, baking beetroot in a steamy foil parcel (our favoured method) requires little active cooking or clearing-up time, and produces perfectly tender roots.</p> \n<p>Bake a batch at the beginning of the week and store in an airtight container in the fridge once cool. The roots tend to hog all the attention, but we like to make the most of the whole bunch by using the stalks in a salad and saving the leaves to make a thrifty pasta, so do buy the freshest, sprightliest looking bunches you can find.</p> \n<p><strong>To roast the beetroot</strong><br />1kg beetroot (about 2 small bunches)</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Set the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Rinse the beetroot. Chop off the stalks and leaves (leaving around 2cm of stalk attached) and dry these thoroughly. Store the stalks and leaves wrapped in damp kitchen paper in the fridge.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Grappling with fresh beets can leave your kitchen looking a little bit like an episode of&nbsp;CSI</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Line a high-sided roasting dish with a large piece of foil; big enough to fully enclose the beetroot – and turn the sides up to prevent leakage. Add the beetroot and 350ml water, then fold the foil over the top like a parcel. Bake until cooked. This will take around 1 hour – when a knife slides through them easily, they are ready.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Remove and leave to cool before peeling – you should be able to just push the skin off. If there are tough areas, use a peeler. You may want to pull on some rubber gloves before getting involved, though we rarely bother.</p> \n<h2><strong>The weeknight comfort dish: Beetroot and pearl barley ‘risotto’ (pictured above)</strong></h2> \n<p>In spite of the drama of its deep colour, this is a simple vegetarian dish, perfect for weeknights when you need something soothing and comforting.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br />150g pearl barley<br />2 tbsp extra virgin olive oil, for frying<br />1 medium carrot, finely chopped<br />1 stick of celery, finely chopped<br />6-8 shallots, finely chopped <br />2 garlic cloves, finely sliced<br />300g roasted beetroot, grated<br />1 tsp dried thyme<br />250ml white wine<br />450ml chicken or vegetable stock<br />Juice of 1 lemon<br />Crumbled feta, to serve<br /></p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> First, cook the pearl barley. Rinse the barley under the tap, then transfer to a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat and simmer for 40 minutes. (Do your vegetable prep while the barley is simmering).

Add the garlic and beetroot, then sprinkle over the thyme. Cook for about 3 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon to prevent the mix from catching. Turn the heat up and add the wine. Cook until the alcohol has reduced by half.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Using a slotted spoon, transfer the barley to the casserole dish, and add a few ladles of hot stock to cover. Season, then stir continuously with a wooden spoon, adding more stock as necessary, until the barley is tender and the liquid has been absorbed. (If you have plenty of beetroot leaves, pop a handful into the pot at this point).</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Squeeze in the juice from half the lemon, then taste to check the seasoning. Add more salt and lemon juice, to taste.</p> \n<p><strong>5</strong> Serve in bowls, with a scattering of feta and a final drizzle of olive oil on top.</p> \n<h2><strong>The summer starter: Beetroot and garlic dip</strong></h2> \n<p>This pretty pink dip is a classic way to make use of leftover cooked beetroot. You could simply serve it with crudit&eacute;sas a starter, or for a slightly different take, try it as a main course, topped atop a couple of baked sweet potatoes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9c673c3417a44024d142a3fa279363d5588e37f7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228427193/575db93e-5e40-4466-872b-616874456352-417x420.jpeg\" alt=\"beetroot dip\" width=\"417\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You could simply serve the dip as a starter, or atop a couple of baked sweet potatoes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Serves 2 </strong><br /><strong>For the dip<br /></strong>200g roasted beetroot, chopped <br />1&frac12; lemons<br />150ml Greek yoghurt<br />1 garlic clove, crushed<br />Salt and black pepper<br />2 tbsp pine nuts<br /><strong><br />For the baked sweet potatoes</strong><br />2 largish sweet potatoes<br />2 tsp olive oil<br />Sea salt</p> \n<p><strong>To serve</strong><br />100g white cabbage</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5.

Cut the beetroot stalks into roughly 3cm pieces. Blanch them for a few minutes, then drain and transfer to a bowl of very cold water.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Slice (ideally using a mandoline, if you have one) the onion into very thin, semi-circular pieces.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Whisk the dressing ingredients together and add to a bowl along with the drained stalks and red onion. Leave it to sit for 2 hours, or overnight.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> To make the fritters, coarsely grate the beetroot into a large bowl. Add salt and pepper, cumin, egg and gram flour, and mix well. If the mixture seems too wet, add a bit more flour. Crumble in the cheese, then add the dill, and give it all another good stir.</p> \n<p><strong>5</strong> Add oil to a large pan and heat until very hot (throw in a small test piece of mixture; if it sizzles then you’re good to go). Scoop 1 tbsp of the raw fritter mixture from the bowl, form it into a ball-shaped patty in your hands and place in the pan. Repeat. (We find 3 fritters to be the optimal number to fry at a time, but it will depend on the size of your pan).</p> \n<p><strong>6</strong> Cook for 30 seconds, before pressing down on each patty with a spatula, so they squish out and become larger and thinner. Fry for around 4 minutes on each side, until crisp and golden. Remove to a plate lined with kitchen paper and keep warm while you cook the rest.</p> \n<p><strong>7</strong> Complete the salad by dividing the rocket between plates, topping with the stalk-onion mix and sprinkling over the chopped walnuts.</p> \n<p><em>Caroline Craig and Sophie Missing are the authors of The Little Book of Lunch (Square Peg) and the forthcoming The Cornershop Cookbook (Square Peg)</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435227300898/f5c86c98-0272-4d5c-a4f8-0f9fdca82cb4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian","altText":"Beetroot and pearl barley ‘risotto’ ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228425818/3a0b5602-70bf-4888-bfe1-17a2282fff76-2028x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":2028,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"You could simply serve the dip as a starter, or atop a couple of baked sweet potatoes.
