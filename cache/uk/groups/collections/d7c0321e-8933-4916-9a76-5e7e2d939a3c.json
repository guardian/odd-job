Add apricots to sweet-tasting duck or to crumble and cream for pudding</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>A perfect apricot is the most elusive of fruits. As with a peach or a plum, ripeness is all, and a good one can be tricky to track down. When you do finally find a glowingly ripe apricot, honey sweet with a pleasing pinch of acidity, and almost jelly-like flesh, it is worth eating on its own, perhaps at breakfast. Pity then, that most of the apricots we find in the shops are pretty hit and miss.</p> \n<p>At least that is how it used to be. I can’t be the only person to notice that things are looking up and over the past couple of years a decent apricot is less rare, even in supermarkets. After writing them off as a lost cause, I am buying this fruit again.</p> \n<p>If your apricots are not at the point of perfection you have two choices: one is to leave them a day or two and hope they will get there; the other is to cook with them. Even the toughest refuse-to-ripen fruit can be seduced into a decent jam with enough sugar and a bit of slow cooking. But those fruits that are on the verge will work in a pie or tart, deepening in flavour as they soften in the heat. The ripest of mine ended up adding a little tartness to a saut&eacute;ed duck breast this week, while the rest went into a loose-crusted crumbly pie. Only the perfect ones, flushed with pink and freckled with scarlet, made it to the breakfast table.</p> \n<p>The lighter, less cloying dairy produce will flatter a dish of stewed apricots (add a few verbena leaves to the syrup) without smothering. Fromage frais, young, soft goat’s cheeses, faisselle, or an unstrained yogurt are my choice. Don’t waste your time making fools and ices: the flavour will be drowned by the cream. That said, I wouldn’t say no to a trickle of unpasteurised double cream over a warm apricot pie or the crumble tart below.</p> \n<h2>Duck with apricots<br /></h2> \n<p>The duck breast is a neat, lean cut of meat that cooks quickly – qualities that can be negative or positive depending on your outlook. The meat and crisped skin of the duck works nicely with ripe apricots.</p> \n<p>I have added a few radishes for heat and crunch, and green peas as the classic duck accompaniment. Serves 2.</p> \n<p><strong>duck breasts </strong>2, boned, skin on<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>peas </strong>80g<br /><strong>radishes </strong>10<strong> </strong><br /><strong>apricots </strong>6<br /><strong>red-wine vinegar </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>butter </strong>a thin slice</p> \n<p>Put the duck breasts, skin side up, on a chopping board and slash in three or four places, going through the skin and about half way down through the meat. Season with salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Place a nonstick shallow pan over a moderate heat, pour in the oil, then place the duck, skin side down, in the pan and let the skin brown lightly. Turn the duck over, then cover the pan with a lid and let the breasts cook over a moderate heat for 7 or 8 minutes until they are brown outside and nicely pink within.</p> \n<p>Cook the peas for 4 or 5 minutes in boiling water until tender, then drain them in a colander. Trim the radishes and cut them in half. Halve the apricots and discard their stones.</p> \n<p>Remove the duck breasts to warm plates to rest. Add the radishes, apricots and drained peas to the pan, together with a little more oil if necessary. As soon as they are hot, add the red wine vinegar and butter and toss the apricots and radishes around in the butter and vinegar till all is glossy.</p> \n<p>Spoon the peas, apricots, radishes and pan juices over the duck breasts and serve.</p> \n<h2>Apricot crumble tart<br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a68ff6934fda5b68effc7894495d2f3120a94d6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540275066/d8f10d5f-c28c-4e81-9839-790d49f5fec8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'A jug of double cream or a pot of cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che might be in order here': apricot crumble tart.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It will firm up as it cools’: apricot crumble tart.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A jug of double cream or a pot of cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che might be in order here. It is essential to use ripe apricots for this, so keep them in a warm place for a day or two if you have bought them under-ripe. This is a deliberately crumbly tart which will firm up as it cools. Serves 6.</p> \n<p>For the crumble crust:<br /><strong>plain flour </strong>200g<br /><strong>sugar </strong>90g, soft, brown<br /><strong>almonds </strong>75g, ground<br /><strong>butter </strong>180g, fridge cold<br /><strong>pine kernels </strong>50g</p> \n<p>For the filling:<br /><strong>apricots </strong>350g, ripe</p> \n<p>You will also need a classic, sloping-sided tart tin measuring approximately 20cm across the base.</p> \n<p>Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4.</p> \n<p>Put the plain flour into the bowl of a food processor, add the soft brown sugar and the ground almonds. Cut the butter into small pieces, add to the bowl, then process for a few seconds, until the texture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Stir the pine kernels into the crumb mixture.</p> \n<p>Tip two-thirds of the crumble mixture into a mixing bowl and add two tablespoons of water to it. Stir the mixture so it resembles damp, slightly sticky crumbs. Press the mixture into the base and sloping sides of the tart tin. Take it slowly, pushing down firmly with a large floured spoon or your floured hand. Don’t worry if it looks rough – you want an open, crumbly texture and it will be covered with fruit later.</p> \n<p>Bake the tart case for 15 minutes, until it is pale brown in colour and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven. Halve the apricots and discard the stones. Place the apricot halves, cut side down, on the pastry crust. Scatter the reserved crumble over the apricots, almost covering them.</p> \n<p>Bake the tart for about 40 minutes until the crust is quite dark and crisp. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 20 minutes before serving. Cream or cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che will be needed.</p> \n<p><em>Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></em></p> \n<p><em>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540104147/duck-with-apricots-in-a-b-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'The meat and crisped skin works nicely with ripe apricots': duck with apricots.\r Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Observer","altText":"duck with apricots, in a bowl","cleanCaption":"'The meat and crisped skin works nicely with ripe apricots': duck with apricots.\r Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540277740/d8f10d5f-c28c-4e81-9839-790d49f5fec8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘It will firm up as it cools’: apricot crumble tart.

The sort of food we can eat without using plates and cutlery. This month I’ve assembled a few recipes for good things we can eat with our hands, from a crisp salad in a coconut pancake to harissa flatbreads for scooping up an aubergine curry. My favourite are warm potato pancakes that I pile with smoked salmon and soured cream and I’ve included those too. So for those of you who, like me, prefer fingers to forks, this month’s recipes are for you.</p> \n<h2>Harissa flatbreads, creamed feta and onions</h2> \n<p> Makes 10-12 round flatbreads<br /><strong>strong white bread flour</strong> 500g<br /><strong>salt</strong> 10g<br /><strong>instant yeast</strong> 10g<br /><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 30g<br /><strong>warm water</strong> about 300ml<br /><strong>harissa paste</strong> 4 tsp<br /><strong>nigella seeds</strong> 1 tbsp</p> \n<p>For the filling<br /><strong>red onions</strong> 3 small<br /><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 100ml<br /><strong>chilli</strong> 1 medium<br /><strong>cucumber</strong> 1 large<br /><strong>feta</strong> 300g<br /><strong>yogurt</strong> 300ml<br /><strong>black pepper<br /></strong><strong>spring onions</strong> 3</p> \n<p>Put the flour in a large, warm mixing bowl and add the salt and the dried instant yeast. Add the butter and most of the water, then mix with your hands to bring the mixture together. Gradually add the remaining water until all the flour is mixed in.</p> \n<p>Put the dough on a lightly floured board and knead for 5-10 minutes. When the dough feels smooth and silky, place it back in the mixing bowl, cover it with a warm tea towel and leave it in a warm place to rise for at least an hour until doubled in size.</p> \n<p>Tip the dough on to a floured surface, then knead in the harissa paste and nigella seeds. Fold repeatedly until all the air is knocked out of it, then tear it into 10-12 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a ball then into rounds about 10-12cm in diameter.</p> \n<p>Peel and finely slice the onions and put them in a small mixing bowl. Add the white wine vinegar and leave for 20 minutes, during which time they will soften.</p> \n<p>Seed and finely chop the chilli. Halve and coarsely grate the cucumber, discarding the seeds and pulp at the core. Put the cucumber and chilli in a bowl then add the crumbled feta and yogurt. Season with black pepper, and the spring onions, finely chopped.</p> \n<p>You can bake the breads if you wish (220C/gas mark 7 for 10 minutes), but I prefer to cook them on a dry, heavy, thick-based frying pan, turning them over, and letting them blister here and there.</p> \n<p>Remove them as they cook, then split each flatbread in half horizontally, gently pulling the two halves almost apart. Stuff with the onions, drained of their vinegar and the creamed feta and cucumber.</p> \n<h2>Coconut milk pancakes</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cd1faa64e4d873c997137b756c80100a9d8a5d6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434452153346/d270d0d2-4006-4b9d-8734-a50125e2343d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Vietnamese Pancake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Fine, super-thin coconut milk pancakes stuffed with crisp salad.</p> \n<p>Makes 8-10 pancakes (serves 4-5)<br /><strong>rice flour</strong> 220g<br /><strong>cornflour</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>salt</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>ground turmeric</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>coconut milk</strong> 400ml<br /><strong>cold water</strong> 300ml<br /><strong>olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>For the dipping sauce<br /><strong>limes</strong> juice of 2<br /><strong>fish sauce</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 1 clove, peeled and crushed<br /><strong>red chilli</strong> 1 small hot, halved</p> \n<p>For the filling<br /><strong>beanshoots</strong> 200g<br /><strong>a crisp lettuce<br /></strong><strong>spring onions</strong> 6<br /><strong>mint leaves</strong> from 4 sprigs<br /><strong>watercress</strong> 250g<br /><strong>shelled cooked prawns</strong> 350g</p> \n<p>Tip the rice flour into a mixing bowl, add the cornflour, salt and turmeric, then beat in the coconut milk and water with a whisk or wooden spoon.

Slice the aubergines in half lengthways, then cut each half into thin slices, about 1cm thick. Pour over the olive oil, season lightly, then toss the vegetables to coat them evenly in the oil. Bake the onions and aubergines for 45 minutes, letting them soften, turning them occasionally.</p> \n<p>Peel the ginger. In a blender or food processor, reduce the chillies, mint, coriander, lime leaves and ginger to a coarse paste, then add the coconut milk and turmeric. Scrape into a medium to large saucepan then add the roasted onions and aubergine and leave to simmer over a moderate heat for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>Put the flours into a large wide mixing bowl. Add the salt and most of the water and mix to a soft dough with a wooden spoon or your hands. Add the remaining water if the dough seems a little dry. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured board and knead for a good five to six minutes. It should not stick to the board, but should feel pliable and soft to the touch. Cover it with a slightly damp cloth.</p> \n<p>Pull bits of dough from the main piece and pat them into flat discs (you should get about 15). Using a floured rolling pin or pasta pin, roll them into discs about 9-10cm in diameter. Continue with the rest of the dough.</p> \n<p>Cook each flatbread in a non-stick pan for a minute or two till they have risen and lightly puffed up, then turn and cook the other side. Remove them as they cook and keep warm under a clean tea towel. Serve with the aubergine curry.</p> \n<h2>Potato pancakes with salmon and dill</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8607b7993acc9613f734421484d1d3a3d8528bc3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434452236903/9b6fca64-3875-45d4-b2f5-a3120357c246-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Potato Farl with Salmon\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Potatoes that are steamed will generally produce a drier mash which is what you need for a potato cake such as these.<br /></p> \n<p>Makes 8 pancakes<br /><strong>floury potatoes</strong> 700g, medium sized<br /><strong>salt and black pepper<br /></strong><strong>butter</strong> 30g, plus extra for frying<br /><strong>plain flour</strong> 70g</p> \n<p>For the soured cream<br /><strong>soured cream</strong> a small pot, about 150ml<br /><strong>grain mustard</strong> 2 tbsp or to taste<br /><strong>dill</strong> 2 tbsp, chopped</p> \n<p>To serve<br /><strong>smoked salmon</strong></p> \n<p>Peel the potatoes, cut them into large pieces and steam them over boiling water for 20-30 minutes till tender.

For rice-based packed lunches, an office microwave is ideal. If your office is unadorned with such technological riches, refrigerate your lunch, but take it out a little while before you eat, so it has time to come to a more palatable temperature. Food safety is key, so as soon as you have cooked your rice dish at home, refrigerate it as quickly as possible.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Make a batch of simple, veggie paella the night before. Sweat some chopped onion, red and yellow pepper, and pierced cherry tomatoes in olive oil, then add paella rice along with a glug of sherry, a pinch of saffron soaked in warm water, turmeric, smoked paprika and hot veggie stock. Put a lid on and simmer until cooked. Pack along with a lemon wedge and some parsley.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Kedgeree is delicious, but there is a time and a place for it. Fishy rice is best kept away from colleagues for the sake of your career prospects. Eggeree, however, is acceptable (probably): soak rinsed basmati rice in warm water for 30 minutes while you slowly fry a thinly sliced onion with a cinnamon stick and green cardamom seeds in lots of butter or ghee. Add the rice, followed by chilli powder and turmeric, then cover with chicken stock. Put a lid on and leave to simmer until the rice is cooked. Chill, then pack with a couple of chopped boiled eggs and parsley.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Though a founder-member of the yellow/beige food group (see also jacket potatoes and pies), egg fried rice can easily be given a fresh twist with the addition of spring veg. For one portion, finely chop one garlic clove and three spring onions. Wash and dry a small bunch of watercress, ripping off leaves, and chopping thick stems into small bits. Slice half a bunch of asparagus into small, bitesize pieces. Add &frac12; tbsp olive oil to a wok or large pan on a medium-high heat. Add garlic and spring onion and fry for a minute, until just starting to colour, then add the watercress stalks and asparagus. Cook for another couple of minutes, stirring occasionally. When just about cooked and bright green, add the watercress leaves, one tbsp of tamari, &frac12; tsp grated ginger, and 70g cooked brown rice. Cook until heated all the way through, then crack in an egg and stir furiously, scrambling, until completely cooked.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> For a super-speedy, fiery takeaway, go Korean and add 75g kimchi to your rice. Buy it from Asian supermarkets, online from websites such as <a href=\"http://www.souschef.co.uk/\">souschef.co.uk</a>, or make your own. Squeeze out as much juice from the kimchi as you can into a bowl, then roughly chop the cabbage. Add a glug of soy sauce and a teeny bit of chilli and sesame oil to the juice. Heat &frac12; tbsp vegetable oil to a wok or large pan on a medium-high heat. Add the kimchi and 1 grated carrot, then fry for 2 minutes, until the veg begins to colour. Add 70g cooked rice and continue to fry, stirring. When all is well mixed, add the juice mix. Fry until piping hot. Reheat at lunch time, or eat at room temperature, spooned into little gem leaves and topped with sliced cucumber and some shredded chicken.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434626568250/b6b68a8c-1835-4c49-9089-b59f187c60c1-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Hennie Haworth for the Guardian","altText":"Egg fried rice with chopsticks","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Hennie Haworth for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T09:00:05Z","lastModified":"2015-06-21T09:00:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[{"name":"Sophie Missing","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sophie-missing"},{"name":"Caroline Craig","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caroline-craig"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"The lunch box","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/the-lunch-box"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/rice-recipes-packed-lunch-ideas","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4av2t","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/rice-recipes-packed-lunch-ideas","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/21/rice-recipes-packed-lunch-ideas"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434626514831/2ffdd70e-5d5c-4c17-ad0c-c4b66dd43702-1020x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Egg fried rice is perfect for packing in your lunchbox.

This recipe has been tweaked to just a liquid soup, which works to whet the appetite and isn’t too filling. We add a stick of celery for scooping and crunching.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>onions</strong> 2<br /><strong>carrot</strong> 1, large<br /><strong>celery</strong> 4 sticks<br /><strong>groundnut oil</strong> 3 tbsp<br /><strong>white pepper</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>Scotch bonnet pepper</strong> 1<br /><strong>tomato puree</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>smooth peanut butter </strong>2 level tbsp<br /><strong>hot vegetable or chicken stock</strong> 1l<br /><strong>sea salt flakes</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>black pepper</strong> a pinch</p> \n<p>Finely dice the onions, carrot and 2 of the celery sticks.</p> \n<p>Heat the groundnut oil in a large non-stick heavy-bottomed pan.

Stir in the peanut butter and leave to cook for another minute.</p> \n<p>Now add the stock – it’s important to add it gradually, stirring all the time. This helps the elements in the soup to meld well. Once all the stock has been added, cover with a lid and cook for 40 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>Remove the Scotch bonnet pepper before blending with a hand blender for 2-3 minutes. Aim not to blend too heavily, as the soup can become too creamy (for our liking…).</p> \n<p>Top and tail the remaining 2 celery sticks, then, using a vegetable peeler, nick the ends and pull out any thick fibres. Pour the soup into bowls, then halve the celery sticks and place one in each bowl, resting on the edge. Sprinkle with salt and pepper.

Something that distinguishes the jollof that I am most familiar with is the delicious meat sauce that accompanies it. The sauce ingredients echo those in a traditional jollof rice, and it’s banging with chicken.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>onions</strong> 4<br /><strong>red peppers</strong> 3<br /><strong>small whole chicken</strong> 1 (about 1kg)<br /><strong>salt</strong> 2 tsp<br /><strong>black pepper</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>fresh thyme leaves</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>50ml<br /><strong>Scotch bonnet pepper</strong> 1<br /><strong>fresh tomatoes</strong> 2<br /><strong>garlic</strong> 4 cloves<br /><strong>tomato puree</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>vegetable stock</strong> 200ml</p> \n<p>Finely slice the onions and red peppers. Chop the chicken into 12 pieces, skin them and trim off any fat. Using your hands, mix the chicken with the salt, pepper and thyme.</p> \n<p>Fry the chicken pieces in the oil with a whole Scotch bonnet pepper on a medium heat for 15 minutes, turning them every 4 minutes. Ensure each piece has room to move. Once the chicken is nicely browned, remove from the pan and put to one side.</p> \n<p>Add the onions and red peppers to the pan and fry them for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, bring a small pan of water to the boil. Gently slit the skins of the tomatoes and drop them into the boiling water. When the skin begins to come away from the flesh, take them out and peel away the skin with your hands.</p> \n<p>Crush the garlic and finely chop the skinned tomatoes. Stir the garlic, tomatoes and tomato puree into the pan of sauce, then turn the heat down to low and cook for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Return the chicken to the pan, pour in the stock and cook for a further 15 minutes. Taste and season with salt if necessary.

I strongly suggest that you use the concentrate for this marinade. It’s much easier to use than pods and blocks, and it keeps for a long time too.<br /></p> \n<p>If you do have fresh tamarind pods, crack the shells and remove the case and the fibrous veins that surround the sticky pulp. Refrigerating makes them easy to peel. You can use pork loin chops for this recipe, but the shoulder is better because of the marbling of fat that run through it.</p> \n<p>This tamarind marinade can also be used to coat cubed butternut squash before roasting it until sticky and caramelised.</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>pork shoulder chops</strong> 800g<br /><strong>spring onions</strong> 6<br /><strong>carrots</strong> 2, large</p> \n<p>For the marinade<br />(Makes about 400ml)<br /><strong>tamarind concentrate </strong>4 tbsp<br /><strong>clear honey</strong> 100g<br /><strong>fresh blueberries </strong>500g, mashed<br /><strong>garlic granules</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>salt</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>smoked paprika</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>sumac</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>coarse black pepper</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>extra virgin olive oil </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>balsamic vinegar</strong> 1 tbsp</p> \n<p>Put all the marinade ingredients into a large bowl and stir well. Add the chops and cover with the marinade. Refrigerate for 2 hours.<br /></p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 200C/gas mark 6 and roast the pork on the middle shelf for 30 minutes, then turn the oven to a medium grill setting.</p> \n<p>Remove the meat from the oven and slice it into long 1cm wide strips. Return the strips to the roasting tray with their juices, and finish them under the grill for a final 10 minutes. The marinade will concentrate and it will become even darker and stickier.</p> \n<p>While the meat is grilling, finely slice the spring onions and finely grate the carrots. Garnish the pork and serve with noodles.</p> \n<h2>Chicory and date with mustard tahini dressing</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"762f1136b4a4e50b2c8027a1b05b3f2de13f6515\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464492475/a355c70e-2cf0-46e2-ac4c-d688767ad3ff-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chicory\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jacob: I became fond of chicory, or endive as it’s called in France, while living in Paris.

Remove the core at the base and separate the leaves.<br /></p> \n<p>Chop the stoned dates into small cubes by halving, cutting into strips and dicing. Working with wet hands prevents the dates from sticking.</p> \n<p>Mix the mustard, tahini, honey, lemon juice and salt in a small bowl. Gradually add the olive oil, stirring as you go until it is well combined.</p> \n<p>Add more oil or a little water if a thinner dressing is desired. Toss the dates and chicory with 3 or 4 tablespoons of dressing, and serve.</p> \n<h2>Mango kohlrabi salad</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b99a57a9d9ae5945753e29d0501eb6b830b65528\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434464536332/f55c1e49-f94c-4c44-a5dd-28bde403ee33-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"mango\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Duval: This simple salad is light, fresh and tactile. It goes very well with fish. Kohlrabi can be visually intimidating but it is an easy ingredient to use. If you can’t get hold of it, you can use broccoli stalks or turnips as a substitute. It’s important to search for a very hard, green, unripe mango to achieve a crunchy salad.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>kohlrabi</strong> 1 (400g)<br /><strong>green mango</strong> 1 (400g)</p> \n<p>Trim the stalks of the kohlrabi and peel off the skin. Make sure to remove enough skin so that you are left with just the flesh of the vegetable.

Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the sure signs that summer is in full swing are the boxes of Alphonso mangoes stacked up outside my local Lebanese grocer. They are so sweet and juicy that it is impossible to eat them without getting into a sticky mess – a far cry from the larger, green varieties you get in supermarkets all year round. They also make a brilliant chilled fruit salad that’s wonderful after barbecued chicken.</p> \n<h2><strong>Thai barbecued chicken with warm coconut and rice salad</strong></h2> \n<p>Spatchcock the chicken (or ask your butcher to), so as much of the surface as possible is exposed to the flame. Marinate the bird for at least two hours, preferably overnight – the extra wait is well worth it. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>1 medium chicken</strong><br /><strong>1 bunch coriander, stalks and leaves separated </strong><br /><strong>Zest and juice of 2 limes</strong><br /><strong>2 green chillies, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 thumb-sized piece fresh ginger, peeled and roughly chopped </strong><br /><strong>3 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 sticks lemongrass, outer layer removed, chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sunflower oil</strong><br /><strong>Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp palm sugar (or demerara, or any kind of brown sugar)</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp fish sauce</strong></p> \n<p>For the rice salad<br /><strong>250g jasmine rice, soaked for 30 minutes</strong><br /><strong>400ml coconut milk</strong><br /><strong>50g coconut flakes, toasted</strong><br /><strong>80g raisins, soaked in warm water</strong><br /><strong>3 spring onions, trimmed and finely sliced</strong><br /><strong>2 carrots, peeled and cut into julienne</strong><br /><strong>Juice of 1 lime</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sesame oil</strong><br /><strong>80g roasted cashew nuts, chopped</strong></p> \n<p>Using a pair of kitchen shears, cut along the length of the chicken’s backbone on both sides, then remove and discard the bone. Put the bird breast side up on a board and press down on the breastbone until it cracks and the bird flattens out.</p> \n<p>Roughly chop the coriander stalks and put in a food processor with the lime zest and juice, chillies, ginger, garlic and lemongrass, and blitz to a paste. Cut a few slashes into the legs and breasts of the chicken and put the bird in a clean plastic bag with no holes. Add three big tablespoons of the paste, the oil and a good grind of salt and pepper, then rub the marinade into the chicken, making sure it gets into all the nooks and crannies. Wrap in a second plastic bag, so it doesn’t leak, and marinate in the fridge for two hours or overnight.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: finely shave the palm sugar with a knife and put into a bowl with the fish sauce. Mash a little with a fork, then slowly work in the excess chilli paste, which will dissolve the sugar. Roughly chop the coriander leaves and stir into the bowl. Adjust the lime, sugar and fish sauce to taste, so it’s perky and savoury.</p> \n<p>If you are using a barbecue, light it an hour before you want to eat, to give the charcoal time to get to the right temperature; otherwise, heat a griddle pan at least five minutes before cooking, so it gets good and hot. Grill the chicken, turning from time to time, until the skin is crisp and charred and the flesh cooked through – about 30 minutes (test for doneness by inserting a skewer into the thickest part of the leg: the juices should run clear; and if the bird seems to be cooking too quickly on the outside, lower the heat). Rest in a warm spot for 10 minutes before you carve.</p> \n<p>To make the salad, put the rice, coconut milk and a teaspoon of salt in a saucepan, and add cold water to cover the rice by 3cm. Bring to a boil, cover with a tight-fitting lid and cook on a high heat for five minutes. Turn the flame to its lowest setting, cook for eight minutes more, then take off the heat and leave, covered, to finish steam-cooking. When the rice is tender, after about 10 minutes, run a fork through it to separate the grains. Mix in the coconut flakes, drained raisins, spring onions and carrot, and season with lime juice, sesame oil, salt and pepper. Toss, check the seasoning and transfer to a salad bowl. Scatter over the cashew nuts and serve with the chicken and dipping sauce.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chilled mango salad in anise-lime syrup</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-a7007927-1cfb-4b67-9f15-ad4bad1dd2c4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434379015237/49606bc1-24ba-44a6-a58e-f69aef4f966b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' chilled mango salad in anise-lime syrup\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ chilled mango salad in anise-lime syrup: use alphonsos, if possible – they’re so much sweeter, juicier and stickier than supermarket green mangos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian. Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>With the sweet mango delicately scented with lime juice and star anise, this refreshing fruit salad has some real body to it. It’s a great way to round off a meal. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>2 fat ripe mangoes</strong><br /><strong>60g agave syrup</strong><br /><strong>Zest and juice of 2 limes</strong><br /><strong>1 star anise</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp 100% agave tequila (optional)</strong><br /><strong>1 small handful fresh mint leaves</strong></p> \n<p> Peel and dice the mangoes, and put in a bowl. Put the agave syrup, lime zest and juice, star anise, chilli and tequila (if using) in a small pan and bring to a simmer. Cook gently for five minutes, then turn off the heat and leave the mixture to cool and the flavours to infuse. When the syrup is cool, pour it on the mangoes and transfer to the fridge to marinate for an hour. Serve scattered with torn mint leaves, perhaps with some vanilla or coconut ice-cream.</p> \n<h2>And for the rest of the week…</h2> \n<p>I always make at least a double batch of the chilli paste, because it freezes so well. Whip it straight out of the freezer and mix into quick, Thai-style pork or beef meatballs. Pan-fry and serve with rice, or cram into baguettes with chilli-laced mayo, or poach in a soothingly spicy Thai-scented broth. Make extra rice salad, too, and take some to work – come lunchtime, you’ll be the envy of the office; sprinkle any excess dipping sauce on stir-fries or use as a marinade for tofu. I love leftover mango salad for breakfast, though instead of ice-cream and mint, I stir in some berries and top with a dollop of thick yoghurt and some toasted coconut flakes or granola.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434378783993/Thomasina-Miers-Thai-styl-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Johanna Parkin for the Guardian.

It shows Dorothy and her younger brother (both&nbsp;to the left) walking to school in Bamburgh, Northumberland, from their home at Budle Bay with three friends. The girls clutching their wild flowers and the children in their ill-fitting hand-me-down clothes make a&nbsp;touching sight.</p> \n<p>Mum’s father was the head gardener and game keeper at the “big house” at Waren Mill; her mother cleaned there and looked after the five children. Money was in short supply and I don’t think the family had a camera. Instead, a passing motorist (rare in those days) took the photograph and sent it along with a letter to my mother, asking about her life. His name was John Heywood of Sale, Cheshire, and he wrote: “Everyone I show it to smiles back, so keep on smiling …” And she did. Mum was renowned for her smile and happy disposition. She married my&nbsp;father when he was stationed at Bamburgh during the war, and we returned there every year for our family holiday. I still go back and walk the road from Budle Bay. It hasn’t changed and I can visualise my mother and uncle walking to school with their&nbsp;friends.</p> \n<p><em>Gwen Irving</em></p> \n<h2>Playlist: How a song changed the course of my life </h2> \n<p><strong>An Angel by the Kelly Family</strong></p> \n<p><em>“I wish I had your pair of wings / Had them last night in my dreams / I was chasing butterflies / Till the sunrise broke my eyes”</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIGGVIkcyWU\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AIGGVIkcyWU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>My husband and I were born and bred on different continents, with more than 11,500km between us. I lived with my mum and sister in a village of&nbsp;1,000 inhabitants in the west of Slovenia, whereas his hometown in Argentina had more than 15m people. But, in 1995,&nbsp;one song started a series of events that brought us together.</p> \n<p>The Kelly Family were becoming more and more successful in Europe, but until 3 March 1995, I had heard about them only in passing. It was the last school dance of the year and, for the final song of the evening, I – at that time, a very shy 14-year-old – gathered up the courage to ask the boy I fancied for a dance. He said “yes” and I was so nervous throughout the whole dance that I didn’t even notice which song it was that we were so awkwardly moving our feet to.</p> \n<p>It was only the following day when I&nbsp;heard the song An Angel playing on the radio that it hit me. From that moment on, the date – 3 March – and&nbsp;the song became sacred to me. I&nbsp;celebrated them both for many years to come.</p> \n<p>In no time, I had become a huge Kelly Family fan and even fantasised about marrying Paddy, one of the younger siblings in the group. When they moved from Germany to Ireland, my interest in the Emerald Isle began to bud. Knowing my mother and her protective ways, I drew up an agreement stating that, when I reached 18, she would allow me to travel to Ireland. She signed it reluctantly, hoping it was just a phase that I would soon get over and thinking I would never have enough money to pull it off, anyway. After all, the financial reality for my family had been tough since my father died 10 years earlier and everybody who knew our situation was quick to discard my dream as nothing more than wishful thinking.</p> \n<p>By the time I was 18, I had grown out of my Kelly Family fixation, but my obsession with Ireland was in full bloom. Against all the odds, I travelled to Ireland that summer and found the landscape and the people as enticing as I had imagined them to be. Even the&nbsp;weather cooperated and there wasn’t a drop of rain through out my whole stay.</p> \n<p>But it was in 2002, the third time I&nbsp;visited Ireland, that the island worked its magic on me. I attended a summer school of Irish music and dance in Limerick, and that’s where I met a South American boy who not only shared my love for Ireland, but turned out to have been born on 3 March. Only five minutes into the conversation, I&nbsp;knew he was “the one” (he, on the&nbsp;other hand, needed a few more days). On meeting him, the circle was&nbsp;complete.</p> \n<p>Three years later and many flying miles under our belts, we settled in Slovenia. My husband, a musician himself, first heard of the Kelly Family through me and never warmed to their music. But to this day, I stop as if in a&nbsp;trance, whenever I hear that special song – the song that started it&nbsp;all.</p> \n<p><em>Ksenija Yoder Batic </em></p> \n<h2>We love to eat: Tommy Mess, invented for Grandma</h2> \n<p><strong>Ingredients</strong><br /><em>4 meringue nests</em><br /><em>1 tub of whipping cream</em><br /><em>Bowl of blueberries, strawberries and&nbsp;raspberries</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"62607657aa206f5208cf62fe84685a15470ecf1c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434388222261/7e050a85-0126-4bae-9e45-6c39558b2c73-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom and Eva with Tommy Mess.\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom and Eva with Tommy Mess.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Whip cream and line up the meringue nests. Scoop blobs of cream into each nest and arrange the fruit on top.</p> \n<p>Having moved from “up north” (Lancashire) to “down south” (Poole), it’s always a treat for us when family come to down to sunny Dorset to visit. Our four-year-old twins, Tom and Eva, get very excited, especially in the run-up to a visit.</p> \n<p>They want to help get the guest room ready and, of course, go to meet and greet the visitors at the train station. Part of the preparation involves planning meals, and when I&nbsp;ask&nbsp;for help, it usually involves requests for fish and chips.&nbsp;</p> \n<p>In preparation for my mother-in-law’s visit, a trip to the supermarket with the twins was in order, and after making the mistake of asking what pudding we should make for Grandma, bypassing suggestions of iced gems and brioche rolls, Eva spotted some meringue nests and so we decided on our own version of Eton Mess.</p> \n<p>When it was finally time to prepare the pudding, my two little helpers were eager to lick the spoons and bowls. I&nbsp;gave them free rein to assemble the dish, and they piled lashings of cream and fruit on top of the meringue. Eva&nbsp;looked at Tom’s and decided to call it Tommy Mess – as the name suggests, it wasn’t the neatest of puddings but it tasted very good.</p> \n<p>Now Tommy Mess is always on the menu when we have visitors.</p> \n<p><em>Kate Cameron</em></p> \n<h2>We’d love to hear your stories<br /></h2> \n<p>We will pay &pound;25 for every Letter to, Playlist, Snapshot or We love to eat we publish.
