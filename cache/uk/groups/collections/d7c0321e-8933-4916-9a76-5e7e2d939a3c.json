Much of the work involved in this summery menu can be done in advance. All you have to do when your guests turn up is chuck a couple of ingredients on the barbecue and toss together a salad. That leaves you plenty of time to enjoy being outside as much as possible. Have fun.</p> \n<h2><strong>Grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d7431b8da468f23e6cbdd701b01b8b697042df51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435682683820/a9176f92-f820-4d11-bbbe-7c605c8a9775-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ grilled halloumi with courgette, peach and burnt-butter almonds: ‘A perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Halloumi is a wonder ingredient, and at its best when introduced to some heat, ideally flame. Here, slices of halloumi are whipped straight from the barbecue to the platter (it doesn’t do sitting around very well), then tossed with juicy peaches, wafer-thin ribbons of courgette and almonds fried in butter. It’s a perfect first course for sunshine and the outdoors. Serves six to eight.</p> \n<p><strong>6 small courgettes<br />4 peaches, peeled, stoned and cut into thickish wedges<br />1 big handful mint leaves, roughly chopped<br />Juice of 1 large lemon<br />4 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil<br />20g butter<br />Salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />50g skin-on almonds, roughly chopped<br />&frac14; tsp paprika <br />500g halloumi, cut into 1cm-thick slices</strong></p> \n<p>Light the barbecue an hour before you want to eat (failing that, use a griddle pan). Peel the courgettes into long, thin strips with a vegetable peeler, rotating them as you do so and stopping before you get to the seedy centre (keep the middles for stewing in olive oil for a soup or side dish the next day). Put the ribbons in a salad bowl with the peach wedges, mint, lemon juice and three tablespoons of oil, toss gently but thoroughly and set aside.</p> \n<p>Put a small frying pan on a medium heat, add the butter and season generously. Swirling the pan constantly, melt the butter and cook for two to three minutes, until it starts darkening. Add the chopped almonds and paprika, cook for another minute or two, until the butter is a dark, biscuity colour and the almonds are golden, then scatter over the salad.</p> \n<p>Rub the slices of halloumi in the remaining tablespoon of oil, then lay on the hottest part of the barbecue (or on a heated griddle pan). Grill for 30-60 seconds on each side, until char marks appear and the cheese softens. Cut each halloumi slice in half, toss into the salad and taste: you may want a scrunch of black pepper, a sprinkling of sea salt, a squeeze more lemon or a touch more olive oil. Adjust accordingly and serve at once.</p> \n<p><strong>Barbecued rabbit (or chicken) with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f5933327bd4f4f84001da3641c975c1790570dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435683145236/ea3b7813-2416-484d-a2aa-b7db15f5dcfc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ barbecued rabbit with burnt-herb rub, slow-cooked cherry tomatoes and lemon a&iuml;oli: ‘Sensational.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’ve used free-range farmed rabbit here, which is really tender and tasty, but skin-on chicken thighs or even a whole spatchcocked chicken will work just as well. The combination of the black, herby rub, sweet tomatoes and garlicky mayonnaise is sensational. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>3 bunches fresh thyme, 1 bunch picked and finely chopped<br />1 bunch fresh mint<br />5 garlic cloves, peeled and roughly chopped <br />Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 farmed rabbits, jointed into 8 pieces (or chicken thighs)<br />80ml extra-virgin olive oil<br />2 punnets cherry tomatoes, halved<br />A few splashes red-wine vinegar </strong></p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli<br /><strong>2 egg yolks<br />1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed to a paste with a little salt<br />1 tsp Dijon mustard<br />750ml mild olive oil <br />Juice of &frac12; lemon</strong></p> \n<p>Put the barbecue on about an hour before you want to eat. Put two dry frying pans on a medium-high heat and divide between them two of the bunches of thyme and the mint. Dry-toast the herbs, shaking the pan every so often, until they have blackened and the room is smelling fragrant – about 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Put two-thirds of the garlic, the chopped thyme and a big pinch of salt in a mortar and bash with a pestle until you have a green paste (or use a food mixer). Pull the leaves from the burnt herbs, add these to the mortar and bash again until broken down and thoroughly mixed in. You should now have a blackish rub. Season generously, transfer to a large bowl and mix in the lemon zest. Add the rabbit pieces and rub them all over with the marinade.</p> \n<p>For the a&iuml;oli, put the egg yolks, garlic, mustard and a generous pinch of salt into a food processor and blitz briefly. With the motor running, very slowly drip the oil through the funnel of the processor, until the mayonnaise starts to thicken and emulsify, then pour in the remaining oil in a slow, steady stream. Loosen with lemon juice and a few tablespoons of water, season to taste and transfer to a bowl.</p> \n<p>Put the oil and the rest of the garlic in a small saucepan over a medium heat. Once the garlic begins to bubble in the oil, cook for a minute or two to soften, then stir in the tomatoes and season generously. Cover with a lid, turn the heat right down and poach gently for 10 minutes, until the tomatoes have softened. Season with the vinegar to taste, and set aside.</p> \n<p>Once the barbecue is ready (ie, when you can hold your hand over the coals for only about five seconds before it gets too hot for comfort), put the rabbit legs and shoulders on the grill. After five minutes, add the belly pieces and, five minutes later, the ribs and saddle. Turn the pieces frequently until charred all over, brushing them with any leftover marinade as they cook – it should take 15-20 minutes from start to finish. (To check that the meat is done, cut into a thick piece.) Pile the cooked rabbit on to a large plate, squeeze over some lemon juice, then spoon on the juicy tomatoes, followed by the a&iuml;oli. Serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"26d235d0cb1ebf1d305499af9aa58c0efbe7239d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435744594796/393c318f-2ca4-4d4d-9391-486a1afcee3f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: 'Low in gluten.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ cocoa-rye cardamom custard tart: ‘Low in gluten.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This delicious cocoa-rye pastry comes from <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/tartine-2.html\">Chad Robertson’s amazing book Tartine 3</a> (&pound;24.99, Chronicle Books). It gives the sweet cardamom custard a crisp, grown-up, dark chocolate edge. It’s also very low in gluten. Serve with a bowl of fresh raspberries alongside. You’ll need a 26cm tart tin. Serves 12-16.</p> \n<p>For the cocoa-rye pastry<strong><br />500g unsalted butter<br />200g caster sugar<br />1 large egg plus 1 yolk, at room temperature<br />&frac12; tsp vanilla extract<br />280g rye flour, sifted<br />170g cocoa powder, sifted, plus extra for dusting</strong></p> \n<p>For the cardamom custard<strong><br />350ml whole milk<br />350ml double cream<br />6 cardamom pods, seeds crushed<br />Seeds from 1 vanilla pod<br />10 egg yolks<br />120g caster sugar</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. To make the pastry, beat the butter and sugar with a paddle mixer until soft and a pale cream colour – this will take a few minutes. Beat in the whole egg, then the yolk, and stop the mixer. Scrape down the sides and beat in the vanilla, followed by the flour and cocoa, until thoroughly combined. Transfer the pastry to a large piece of clingfilm, pat into a rectangle and refrigerate for at least an hour, until firm.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the custard. Put the milk, cream, cardamom, vanilla seeds and pod into a saucepan and bring to simmering point. Simmer gently for three minutes, then set aside for 10 minutes to infuse. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar in a bowl, until light and pale. Discard the vanilla pod, then whisk the warm milk into the eggs and pour into a jug.</p> \n<p>Divide the dough in two and freeze half for another day. Dust both sides of the remaining dough lightly with cocoa powder and roll out between two large pieces of baking paper or clingflim, rotating as you do, until it’s an even thickness of about 4mm. Carefully roll the pastry on to the rolling pin and transfer to a 26cm tart tin. Press firmly into all the corners of the tin, leaving an overhang of roughly 0.5cm. Trim off any excess dough.</p> \n<p>Freeze the pastry case for 15 minutes, then line with baking paper, fill with baking beans and blind bake for 20 minutes, until slightly puffed up. Remove the paper and beans, and bake for 10-15 minutes longer, until the case is completely cooked (take care not to burn it, so check after 10 minutes).</p> \n<p>Turn down the oven to 140C/285F/gas mark 1. Run a sharp knife along the edges of the tart shell to neaten it, then pour in the custard, filling it up right to the brim. Bake in the centre of the oven for about 50 minutes, until just set – it shouldn’t wobble in the centre when you gently shake the tin. Leave the tart to cool completely, and serve with fresh raspberries.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\">the Wahaca group of

recipes: The big tang theory","trailText":"Buttermilk provides a quick, sweet-and-sour dough perfect for honey‑glazed doughnuts and blueberry soda bread buns","standFirst":"<p>Put on your lab coats – there’s mad science at work in this week’s bakes. Acidic buttermilk reacts with bicarbonate of soda to form a quick, sweet-and-sour dough perfect for honey‑glazed doughnuts and blueberry soda bread buns</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>Apart from in the occasional American-style pancake or spruced up scone, buttermilk rarely gets a chance to shine in our cooking. It’s a shame, because its bright tang is the ideal foil to the kind of sickly sweetness and heaviness that baking’s so prone to. It’s also good at keeping cakes perfectly tender, while its acidity – when set off with a pinch of bicarbonate of soda – gives a good rise and light, open crumb. Put it to good use in a glazed cake doughnut or a sweet, blueberry-studded morning roll.</p> \n<h2><strong>Buttermilk doughnuts with a honey glaze</strong></h2> \n<p>Because they are made with baking powder, these doughnuts are far easier and less temperamental than their yeasted cousins. These are closer to the kind of doughnuts you find heaped into grease-stained bags at the funfair and on the seafront than the round sort, plump with custard, chocolate or jam. They’re light and spongy when freshly cooked – far softer than bread doughnuts, and richer too.<br /></p> \n<p>Deep-frying is scary the first time you try it – particularly if you don’t have the luxury of a deep-fat fryer – but give it a go and you’ll find it surprisingly quick and straightforward, if you work carefully. Just make sure you have a sugar thermometer to monitor the temperature of the oil, and keep small hands far away from the action during the frying (there’s plenty for kids to help with during the rolling, stamping and, later, the dunking stages).</p> \n<p><strong>Makes 10-12</strong><br />1.5-2 litres cooking oil<br />300g plain flour<br />60g soft light brown sugar<br />3&frac12; tsp baking powder<br />&frac12; tsp bicarbonate of soda<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />A pinch of nutmeg<br />1 large egg<br />150ml buttermilk<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br /><strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p><strong>For the glaze</strong><br />75g unsalted butter<br />300g icing sugar<br />3 tbsp water<br />6 tbsp runny honey<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />A pinch of salt</p> \n<p>1 First, prepare the glaze. Melt the butter over a low heat. Stir the icing sugar and water together until a thick paste forms, then add the honey, vanilla extract and salt. Whisk in the melted butter until smooth. Set aside in a large bowl (one wide enough to dunk the doughnuts in later).</p> \n<p>2 Pour the cooking oil into a large pan (not nonstick) to a depth of at least 9cm. Do not to overfill the pan. Heat the oil until it’s 180C/350F; use a sugar thermometer to monitor the temperature. Don’t leave the oil unattended while it’s heating. Once it’s up to temperature, turn the heat right down, or even off, to prevent it from smoking.</p> \n<p>3 While the oil heats, prepare the dough. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the egg, buttermilk and vanilla together in a separate bowl before adding this mixture to the dry ingredients. Stir together to get a sticky, malleable dough.</p> \n<p>4 Dust a work surface with plenty of flour, then empty the dough on to it. Pat the dough out to a thickness of roughly 1cm (you can use a rolling pin if you want, but I find it easier just to use my hands here), flouring it as you go to minimise sticking. Cut out 8cm circles using a pastry cutter, then use a smaller 3-4cm cutter or appropriately sized lid to stamp out the small holes in the middle of each doughnut. It’s up to you whether you gather up these doughnut holes to make more doughnuts or just fry them as they are.</p> \n<p>5 Fry the doughnuts in batches of 3 or 4, cooking them for 1 &frac12; minutes on each side. Once cooked, pat dry on a piece of kitchen towel to soak up any excess oil, then, while they’re still warm, dip them in the glaze, coating one or both sides. Leave to cool and set on a wire rack, then repeat the frying and glazing with the remaining doughnuts. These are at their best when they’re freshly cooked, but you can revive them the next day (if they last that long) by warming them in the microwave or a low oven.</p> \n<h2><strong>Blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns</strong></h2> \n<p>Chelsea buns, sticky cinnamon swirls, dough wrapped in toasted pecans and chocolate chips … sweet buns are as good as baking gets, but they’re not ideal if you’ve got an impatient sweet tooth. Too often the thought of a lengthy knead and slow prove sends me careering towards the biscuit tin instead in my laziness. This is a recipe that sidesteps all that hassle, using a quick buttermilk dough instead of the usual bread sort, so you can have these ready, from storecupboard to table, in under an hour. They’re great for breakfasts because they’re not too sweet, but just as good as an afternoon snack.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 12</strong><br />300g plain flour <br />75g wholemeal flour<br />125g caster sugar<br />1&frac12; tsp baking powder<br />1 tsp bicarbonate of soda<br />1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />50g poppy seeds<br />Zest of 2 lemons<br />300ml buttermilk<br />400g blueberries<br />150g icing sugar<br />Lemon juice</p> \n<p><br />1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 20x30cm roasting dish or baking tin with baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Stir the flours, 100g of the caster sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in the poppy seeds and lemon zest. Pour in the buttermilk and work the ingredients together using a wooden spoon until a rough, slightly sticky dough forms. If the mixture feels very floury or crumbly, add a drop of milk.</p> \n<p>3 Dust the work surface with flour and roll the dough out to a rectangle roughly 50x30cm, flouring the rolling pin as you go. Scatter the blueberries all over the surface of the rectangle and pat them gently into the soft dough. Dust over the remaining 25g of caster sugar.</p> \n<p>4 Roll the rectangle up from long edge to long edge to give a roll roughly 50cm long, pinching the dough a little as you reach the end to help it stay securely rolled. Trim off the ends, then cut into 12 equal slices.

Being the child of a North American myself, cooking my way through these dishes reminded me of my own childhood, from camping on the shores of the Great Lakes to being snowed in, and not minding one bit as long as there were cookies. My own memories made me realise that, although American food is well-established in the UK, there are still so many great recipes that somehow aren’t yet quite as common across the pond ...</p> \n<p>Clairetweet brings us funnel cakes – deep-fried, squiggly pancakes that can be found at US fun fairs. They are much like British mini-doughnuts, and every bit as moreish when fresh out the fryer. ColonialCraving’s buttermilk biscuits were similarly addictive; a crisp crust, soft crumb and salty-sweet edge, topped liberally with butter. And of course, there had to be a cookie recipe in here. The Minnesota munchers from Jackie Pieterick have a caramel depth courtesy of a smattering of melted Daim bars. And, if it’s an authentic 4 July-style cookout you’re after, look no further than Thom O’Dwyer’s classic macaroni salad.</p> \n<p>I’ve relished the eating and cooking of every recipe this week, but, in the end, I feel that if you’ve never eaten a sloppy joe, then... well, you’re missing out. Yes, it’s beef mince, in a burger bun, but for some reason, it’s one of the most fun things you’ll ever eat. This classic recipe is slightly sweet with smoky notes from barbecue sauce and could not be simpler to make. This is the kind of feed-a-crowd food that will never fail to please. What’s more American than that?</p> \n<h2><strong>The winning recipe: sloppy joes</strong></h2> \n<p>What could be more American than a sloppy joe? Tangy, sweet, a little spicy and a lot messy.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/HollieinClare\"><em>HollieinClare</em></a><em>, via </em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55816b13e4b05c5f91d258db\"><em>GuardianWitness</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br />1kg minced beef<br />1 large green pepper, diced<br />1 large onion, diced<br />180ml ketchup<br />180ml bottled barbecue sauce<br />2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce<br />4 garlic cloves, minced<br />2 tbsp brown sugar<br />2 tsp chilli powder<br />1 tsp dry mustard<br />Tabasco sauce, to taste<br />Salt and black pepper<br />6-8 burger buns, to serve<br />Salted crisps, to serve<br />Dill pickles, to serve</p> \n<p>1 In a large frying pan, brown the mince, then drain off any excess fat.

Serve with salted crisps and a dill pickle. Enjoy!</p> \n<h2><strong>Funnel cakes</strong></h2> \n<p>To me these are such an American thing; I’ve never even seen them in the UK. They are nothing more than pancake batter, cooked in 3-5cm of oil instead of a frying pan. Rather than using a funnel to drizzle the batter into the pan, I used a squeezy sauce bottle, but you could just as easily use a piping bag, or zip-lock bag with &frac12; cm cut off the end.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/clairetweet\"><em>Clairetweet</em></a><em>, via </em><em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/55816b13e4b05c5f91d258db\">GuardianWitness</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6455dc0637c9ea3e3eff829b9644f581349155fc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435835453244/e6ac9bc6-784e-4269-a5af-adc5f0429b55-460x460.jpeg\" alt=\"ClareTweet's funnel cake. \" width=\"460\" height=\"460\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ClareTweet sent us in this pic of her funnel cake: ‘These really couldn’t be much easier,’ says she. ‘They are nothing more than pancake batter, cooked in 1-2” of oil instead of a frying pan.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ClareTweet/GuardianWitness</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Makes 6-8</strong><br />90ml milk <br />1 tsp vanilla extract<br />1 large egg<br />Grated zest of half an orange<br />90g plain flour <br />1 tsp baking powder<br />1 tbsp caster sugar<br />A pinch of salt<br />Icing sugar, for dusting</p> \n<p>1 Mix the milk, vanilla, egg and orange zest together.

Baking these in something with quite deep sides will really help to support the biscuits as they rise.</p> \n<p>2 Sift together the flour and raising agents into a large mixing bowl, then mix through the salt and sugar. Cut the butter into small pieces and lightly rub it through the flour mix. It doesn’t have to be too uniform.</p> \n<p>3 Add the cream and buttermilk – a bit at a time, as you may not need all of it – and bring it all together with a fork to form a soft dough. Don’t overmix the dough or you’ll get tough biscuits. I use a fork to mix it so that my hands don’t warm up the mixture either.</p> \n<p>4 Turn the dough out on to a lightly floured surface and pat it out to about 1cm thick. Fold it in half, then pat it out again. Fold it one more time and pat it out again so that it’s 1 cm thick. Stamp out 5cm discs using a pastry cutter It’s very important that you don’t twist the cutter though. Place the biscuits in the buttered cake tin. Brush the tops with a little extra melted butter, sprinkle with black pepper and bake for 15-20 minutes.</p> \n<p>5 For the compote, use a small saucepan to combine all of the ingredients. Gently simmer them until the juices begin to thicken and become syrupy. Try not to stir the compote too much – you don’t want to mush up the fruit. Leave the compote to cool completely before serving it with the still-warm biscuits.</p> \n<h2><br /></h2> \n<h2><strong>Minnesota munchers</strong></h2> \n<p>This recipe is adapted from a 1970s Lutheran Church Ladies cookbook and replaces toffee bits with crushed Daim bars, which suits Minnesota’s Swedish roots.<br /><em>Jackie Pieterick, Wolverhampton</em></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 24</strong><br />240g butter, softened<br />270g brown sugar<br />2 medium eggs<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />300g plain flour<br />1 tsp baking powder<br />200g milk chocolate chips<br />200g dark chocolate chips<br />100g white chocolate chips<br />5 x 28g Daim bars, crushed into bits</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4.

Drop tablespoonfuls of the mix on to the prepared baking trays, then bake in batches for 10-12 minutes, until golden. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet before transferring to wire racks to cool completely.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435836171234/49a36e7a-3fba-47f1-8a23-984fe36102b1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"Sloppy joe's the winner this week.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435835453430/5efe710a-bbfa-44df-8bc9-3d9bddd4c6f6-540x540.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":540,"width":540,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"ClareTweet sent us in this pic of her funnel cake: ‘These really couldn’t be much easier,’ says she. ‘They are nothing more than pancake batter, cooked in 1-2” of oil instead of a frying pan.’ Photograph: ClareTweet/GuardianWitness","credit":"ClareTweet/GuardianWitness","altText":"ClareTweet's funnel cake.

And that is to bring together people who dig each other to eat, drink and be merry.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rhubarb, fennel and celery salad</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74e6717693aff84b2ad9845e13d7221b82564bd8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680241140/01f17a10-b2fa-49b8-98c6-4a8a6b1a9ad7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's rhubarb, fennel and celery salad: 'A refreshing starter.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s rhubarb, fennel and celery salad: ‘A refreshing starter.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Don’t dress the salad until just before you serve it, otherwise it will wilt and look unappetising – if you’re taking it on a picnic, pack the dressing separately. It works as a refreshing starter or alongside some fish or meat. A few tablespoons of fresh pomegranate seeds (40g or so) makes a very tasty, not to mention pretty, addition on top. If possible, use a mandoline to cut the fennel, rhubarb and celery. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>3 tbsp olive oil<br />2 tbsp lemon juice<br />1 tbsp maple syrup<br />Salt and black pepper<br />1 large fennel bulb, trimmed and shaved widthways into 2mm slices <br />1 stick rhubarb, trimmed and cut on an angle into 2mm slices<br />4 sticks celery, trimmed and cut on an angle into 2mm slices<br />20g basil leaves, roughly torn<br />15g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped<br />10g dill leaves, roughly chopped<br />2 tsp fennel seeds, toasted and roughly crushed</strong></p> \n<p>Put the oil, lemon and syrup in a large bowl with half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of pepper. Whisk and, just before serving, add the remaining ingredients and toss gently. Simple.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chorizo meatballs in tomato sauce</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6206eceb65c5c79f227d4eaef827782af5a5c5ad\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680368107/7e05af09-e344-47e2-84db-83aafd1e484c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's chorizo meatballs in tomato sauce: 'Hearty and flavourful.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s chorizo meatballs in tomato sauce: ‘Hearty and flavourful.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Whatever the weather, outdoor eating always makes me crave hearty and flavourful food. These meatballs tick all those boxes, and even more so if served with the rice dish that follows. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>5 cooking chorizo, skinned and the meat torn into 2cm pieces<br />500g beef mince<br />70g fresh breadcrumbs<br />20g picked flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped<br />2 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed<br />&frac12; tsp hot paprika<br />Salt<br />60ml olive oil<br />1 small onion, peeled and cut into 1cm dice <br />2 carrots, peeled and cut into 1cm dice<br />&frac12; medium fennel bulb, trimmed and cut into 1cm dice <br />&frac12; tsp ground cumin<br />&frac14; tsp chilli flakes<br />2 cinnamon sticks<br />2 tsp tomato paste<br />350ml chicken stock<br />6 plum tomatoes, blanched, peeled and cut into rough 2cm dice <br />250g Greek yoghurt</strong></p> \n<p>Put the chorizo in a large bowl with the mince, breadcrumbs, three-quarters of the parsley, the garlic, paprika and a teaspoon of salt. Using your hands, shape the mixture into about 35 meatballs, each weighing about 25g and 2.5cm wide.</p> \n<p>Put a large saute pan on a medium-high heat with two tablespoons of oil. Once hot, add half the meatballs and fry for four minutes, turning them every now and then, so they brown all over. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the remaining meatballs.</p> \n<p>When you’ve transferred the second batch of meatballs to the plate, add the onion, carrot, fennel and remaining oil to the pan, turn down the heat to medium and fry gently, stirring frequently, for eight minutes, until softened and golden brown. Add the cumin, chilli, cinnamon and tomato paste, cook for a minute more, then add the stock, tomatoes and a third of a teaspoon of salt. Turn the heat to medium-low and simmer gently for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has slightly thickened. Return the meatballs to the pan, and cook for 10 minutes, until the sauce is thick and the meatballs are cooked through.</p> \n<p>Remove the pan from the heat and serve at once, with the following rice dish alongside, some yoghurt spooned on top (or in a bowl on the side) and the remaining parsley sprinkled on top. </p> \n<h2><strong>Clove and cardamom rice</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09088daa1b73659ec30a47ec7bcf6e916f4803e3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680615523/e7f81ef9-cea3-412b-834d-cf3a3a7512e2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's clove and cardamom rice: 'A simple dish.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s clove and cardamom rice: ‘A simple dish.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This simple side dish is a sneak preview from my new book, <a href=\"http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/nopi-cookbook/9780091957162\">Nopi: The Cookbook</a>, which is out in September. I love to crunch into the whole cloves and cardamom pods, but if you’re not so keen, pick them out before serving. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>1 tbsp olive oil<br />10 whole cloves<br />10 cardamom pods, lightly crushed<br />250g basmati rice, well rinsed<br />Coarse sea salt and black pepper<br />430ml boiling water</strong></p> \n<p>Put the oil and spices in a medium saucepan for which you have a lid, and put on a medium-high heat. Cook for two minutes, stirring continuously, until the cardamom starts to turn golden, then add the rice, one and a quarter teaspoons of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Cook, stirring, for a minute, then pour in the boiling water and turn down the heat as low as it can go. Stir once, cover, and leave for 12 minutes (no peeking). Remove the pan from the heat, take off the lid and quickly cover the pan with a clean tea towel. Put the lid back on, set aside for 10 minutes, then uncover, fluff up the rice with a fork (any grains that were stuck to the bottom will now come off easily) and serve hot.</p> \n<h2><strong>Plum and rum ice-cream</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ce210f0050baedd2d9e78806e40042bdc436301\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435680775717/96881740-4a1a-4551-8658-e0cdbaf5359c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's plum and rum ice-cream: 'Decadent and punchy.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s plum and rum ice-cream: ‘Decadent and punchy.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julian Anderson</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is everything I want from a summer pudding: light and fragrant enough to justify the season, but decadent and punchy enough to make it worth having. Serves six.</p> \n<p><strong>8 large dark plums, cut in half and stoned<br />160g caster sugar<br />90ml dark rum<br />400ml double cream<br />250ml full-fat milk<br />20 cardamom pods, roughly crushed with a pestle and mortar<br />Shaved skin of 1 large orange, plus 2 tbsp orange juice<br />Salt<br />6 egg yolks</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Put the plums in a large bowl with 50g sugar and three tablespoons of rum, stir, then spread the plums cut side up on a parchment-lined baking tray. Pour over the sugary rum and bake for 20 minutes, until soft and caramelised. Remove and set aside to cool for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>Put all the syrup from the baking tray and 250g of the cooked plums (ie, about a quarter of them) in the small bowl of a food processor, blitz smooth, then set aside. Set aside the remaining baked plums until later, too (or, if you’re planning to serve this the next day, keep them in the fridge).</p> \n<p>Put the cream, milk, cardamom, orange skin and juice, and an eighth of a teaspoon of salt in a large saucepan, and cook on medium heat for about five minutes, stirring regularly, until it is almost coming to a boil. Remove from the heat and set aside to infuse for at least 20 minutes.</p> \n<p>Add the pureed plum mix to the cream mix and warm gently for five minutes. Put the egg yolks in a large bowl with the remaining 110g sugar and whisk until smooth. Add a ladleful of the creamy plum mix to the egg, whisking continuously, then repeat ladle by ladle until it is fully incorporated.</p> \n<p>Clean the saucepan, add the custard mix and cook on a medium-low heat for five to six minutes, stirring continuously, until it has thickened and you can draw a clear line through it with the back of a wooden spoon. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p> \n<p>Once the mixture is cool, strain it, then stir in the remaining three tablespoons of rum. Pick out and discard the orange skin and cardamom, then pour into an ice-cream machine and churn for about an hour, until thick and almost set. Transfer to a plastic container, cover and freeze for at least three hours until set. If it’s frozen for more than five hours, you’ll need to take the ice-cream out of the freezer 30 minutes before serving, to soften.</p> \n<p>To serve, scoop the ice-cream into bowls and top with the reserved baked plums.</p> \n<p> <span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk/locations\">Nopi</a> in London.</p> \n<p><strong>Fiona Beckett’s wine matches </strong>Chorizo meatballs suggest a Spanish red, but rioja is not the only game in town: try the vibrant, juicy <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/mesta-tempranillo-old-vines-case-of-6/p/p60070320?OmnitureRedirect=mesta+tempranillo\"><strong>Mesta Organic Old Vine Tempranillo 2014</strong></a> (14% abv), from the relatively unknown Ucl&eacute;s region – it’s a bargain at &pound;8 from Marks &amp; Spencer.

This week’s recipes for outdoor eating, however, have a Gallic inspiration, because to me, perversely, Wimbledon always conjures up the flavours of France. The Proustian roots of this connection are somewhat tangled. I have a feeling it goes back to 1983, and the semi-final between Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe. I was 13, a plump and increasingly self-conscious boy. School had broken up early, so I had gone to stay with a friend’s parents in France. We all gathered to watch the match in the rather grand, formal sitting room in their diplomatic residence.</p> \n<p>Ignoring the anxious mutterings of my friend’s mother, I took a berth on the window seat, with my back slouched against the windowpane. When Lendl (for some reason my childhood hero) pulled off a rare stroke of genius, I made a clumsy, air-punching convulsion and heard a terrible crack behind me, followed by a rush of air around the ears as I somersaulted backwards through the broken window and landed with a <em>plumph</em> on the flower bed outside.</p> \n<p>I was physically unscathed, but the embarrassment of that moment – looking back up at the window, and seeing the entire party staring back at me, agog – makes it easily my most vivid Wimbledon memory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I somersaulted backwards through the broken window and landed with a plumph on the flower bed outside</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>There was a silver lining, however, and that was that my friend’s mum was an absolutely amazing cook. Both Lendl’s inevitable defeat and my shame were soon washed away by a slap-up picnic lunch in the garden. I hope this lunch will help you recover from even the gravest setbacks.</p> \n<h2><strong>Pissaladi&egrave;re</strong></h2> \n<p>You can use a flaky pastry recipe, such as the one from our <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/12/cornish-pasty-recipe-squash-blue-cheese-spinach-pecan-henry-dimbleby\">Back to Basics pasty recipe</a>. A pizza dough works too.If you are feeling rushed, bought puff pastry makes a good substitute.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br />325g flaky puff pastry<br />2 tbsp olive oil<br />3 onions, cut in half and thinly sliced<br />3 red onions, thinly sliced<br />A sprig of thyme<br />1 bay leaf<br />12 anchovies in oil<br />1 garlic clove, crushed<br />A pinch of sugar<br />Salt<br />15-20 pitted black olives</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Make the pastry as directed. Wrap it in clingfilm and allow it to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. When chilled, roll it out on a floured surface into a rough rectangle, about 2mm thick, that will fit on your baking tray. Transfer the pastry to the baking tray and rest in the fridge (or in a cool place ) for another 20 minutes.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Now prick the pastry all over with a fork and bake for 10-15 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow it to cool.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> To cook the onions, heat the oil in a large, heavy-based pan. Add the thinly sliced onions along with the thyme and bay.

Prepare the vegetables by scooping out the seeds of the tomatoes, cutting the courgettes in half lengthways and scooping out the centre parts with a melon baller a teaspoon<strong>.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Cut the aubergine horizontally into 3 rough cylinders and carefully cut out some of their centres with a knife. Drizzle all of the veg with a little olive oil and season well.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Make the stuffing by blitzing the stuffing ingredients together with the remaining oil in a food processor for 5 seconds and season well. <br /></p> \n<p><strong>4 </strong>Fill the vegetables with the stuffing and bake on a tray in a medium oven for about 20 minutes, or until soft and the tops are golden brown.</p> \n<h2><strong>Vegetable ni&ccedil;oise salad</strong></h2> \n<p>4 eggs<br />2 little gem lettuce, washed and dried<br />150g French beans<br />150g runner beans<br />1 head of fennel <br />4 radishes<br />200g new potatoes, cooked and sliced<br /><strong> <br />For the dressing</strong><br />50g piquillo peppers (or other skinned peppers)<br />Leaves from a small bunch of basil (save some for garnishing)<br />1 garlic clove, crushed<br />50ml olive oil <br />1 tbsp red wine vinegar<br />Salt and black pepper</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Cook the eggs in boiling water for 6 minutes. Remove from the pan and refresh under cold running water. Peel and quarter.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Cut the lettuce into thin wedges. Trim the French beans and blanch in boiling salted water for 2-3 minutes, until tender and “squeaky”. Refresh and drain. Top and tail the runners and cut into thin strips on the diagonal. Cook as the French beans. Toss the beans in a little olive oil and season well.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Shave the head of fennel and slice the radishes into thin rounds. Arrange these on a platter along with the lettuce, potatoes and beans.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Make the red-pepper dressing by blitzing the rest of the ingredients together with a stick blender or liquidiser and season well. Drizzle over the salad. Top with the quartered eggs and extra torn basil leaves.</p> \n<p><em>Henry Dimbleby is co-founder of the natural fast-food restaurant chain Leon; Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/henrydimbleby\">@HenryDimbleby</a>.

Cinemagraph by Emma Lee/Mateusz Karpow/Lizzie Mayson\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>For my last meal, I’d like to be at Blackberry Cottage</strong>, the house in Devon where we had happy family holidays for about 30 years. I cooked there more than anywhere else. I would like my last feast to be lunch so grandchildren of any age could join in.</p> \n<p><strong>It would be late summer, so we could eat on the terrace</strong> overlooking the widest expanse of the tidal river Dart, dotted with sailing boats. In the orchard below us apples and plums would be ripening. Our long wooden table would be decorated with little bunches of flowers from the garden in glass jars, and scattered all over with rose petals.</p> \n<p><strong>Our life there was all about boats and picnics</strong>. I used to make an enormous quiche and take it in its dish wrapped in masses of newspaper, still warm, to the beach – I’d prepare everything for everyone, all the time. I don’t know how I did it now. Quite often I’d be in Dartmouth market laden with baskets, crying with exhaustion but it was so lovely – everyone loved it so much.</p> \n<p><strong>My family would all be there, and my partner Johnny.</strong> My ex-husband David would have to look in as it was his place, too– it was he who first encouraged me to write down my invented recipes, often inspired by my peripatetic childhood in far-flung places abroad, which started a career I never trained for or expected.</p> \n<p><strong>My training was as a singer, so music is as important to me as food.</strong> After the meal I would like my daughter Kate to sing songs that would make us laugh and cry, accompanied by my daughter Liza on her flute and my brother Ben on his musical saw. It would be wonderful to hear their music wafting over the water as we nibbled a chocolate or two and digested our food. Kate does a lot of jazz cabaret, and she’d know all the early songs I love – Peggy Lee, Dorie Previn, all the songs from the 40s and 50s; David used to accompany me on the piano when I still sang. But we never all played together as a family. I remember a very little Henry once walking in when David and I were playing, with his fingers in his ears.</p> \n<p><strong>Since I would be about to die I would want to relax and enjoy the company of my loved ones</strong>, so I might make the puddings in advance. But my son Henry and our friend of many years Bruno Loubet, who produces exactly the kind of imaginative food I love most, would cook the rest. My friend Johnny could be the brilliant sous-chef and host that he is.</p> \n<p><strong>As it would be a Devon feast, I’d stick to things we especially enjoyed there</strong>. Plump Brixham scallops set in saffron wine jelly, followed by roast ribs of tender Devon beef, spiked with smoked oysters and accompanied by Bruno’s pommes dauphinoise and fresh peas with slow-cooked garlic.</p> \n<p><strong>And, since my family used to call me the queen of tarts,</strong> we’d finish with one of my crispy upside-down apple tarts, glazed with quince jelly made from the orchard tree, together with my calvados ice-cream, which my children’s friends raved about.</p> \n<h2>Josceline Dimbleby’s crisp and aromatic apple tart</h2> \n<p>In this recipe, the apples are cooked long and gently so they go a lovely shade of pink.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br />100g unsalted butter<br />4 tbsp golden caster sugar<br />1kg dessert apples<br />Finely grated rind of 2 oranges<br />2 tsp ground cardamom<br />2 tsp ground cinnamon<br />400g filo pastry<br />Quince jelly</p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> Preheat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. Smear the bottom of a 26-27cm round ovenproof flan dish with 25g of the butter and sprinkle 3 tbsp of the caster sugar evenly on top.</p> \n<p><strong>2</strong> Core the unpeeled apples and slice them thinly into half-moon shapes. Arrange a neat layer of overlapping apple slices on top of the caster sugar. Sprinkle with half the grated orange rind, then evenly arrange the remaining apple slices on top – they don’t have to be so neat this time.</p> \n<p><strong>3</strong> Sprinkle with the remaining orange rind and cover with foil. Bake on the centre shelf of the oven for 1 &frac12; -2 hours, until the apples are tender.</p> \n<p><strong>4</strong> Then carefully pour any apple juice into a small saucepan, boil fiercely until syrupy, pour back over the apples and leave until cold.</p> \n<p><strong>5</strong> Gently melt the remaining butter in a saucepan and remove from the heat. Put 1 tbsp caster sugar in a small bowl and stir in the ground spices.</p> \n<p><strong>6</strong> Lay a sheet of filo pastry on top of the apples, folding the edges into the dish. Brush thinly with some of the melted butter and scatter lightly and evenly with a little sugar and spice mixture. Lay another sheet of filo pastry on top and repeat the butter, sugar and spice procedure, again pressing the pastry edges into the dish. Continue like this until all the filo is used up, just buttering the last piece and sprinkling it with a little sugar.</p> \n<p><strong>7</strong> Preheat the oven to 190C/375F/gas mark 5 and put the tart on the centre shelf. Cook for 25 minutes, then turn down the heat to 1670C/325F/gas mark gas 3 and cook for a further 20 minutes, until the pastry is a deep brown.</p> \n<p><strong>8</strong> To serve, put a large, flat serving plate on top of the flan dish and turn both upside down. Give it a good shake and turn the tart out on to the serving plate, carefully lifting the dish off. Serve hot or warm. Before serving brush the apples with a little melted quince jelly.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435836334754/497bc215-b448-435b-b7e1-a2cf447b4e44-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Emma Lee for the Guardian","altText":"josceline dimbleby last bites","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Emma Lee for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-03T11:00:11Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T23:07:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Dale Berning Sawa","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/dale-berning"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style","Chefs"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/chefs","webTitle":"Chefs"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Dale Berning Sawa","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/dale-berning"}}],"series":{"title":"Last bites","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/last-bites"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/josceline-dimbleby-final-meal-last-bites","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abv8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/josceline-dimbleby-final-meal-last-bites","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/03/josceline-dimbleby-final-meal-last-bites"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":3,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435836334754/497bc215-b448-435b-b7e1-a2cf447b4e44-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Emma Lee for the Guardian","altText":"josceline dimbleby last bites","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Emma Lee for the Guardian"}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-06-18T08:17:41Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/d7c0321e-8933-4916-9a76-5e7e2d939a3c","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/d7c0321e-8933-4916-9a76-5e7e2d939a3c"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink/front"}
