The first time I visited, I was struck by the stillness of the sea there, the flat, empty expanse of pebbled beach and the brutalist concrete pier, which no one could describe as charming, but which has come to be precisely that to me. Deal has few of the tourist-bait accoutrements that clutter other British seaside towns. It’s a place with special light and a confluence of modernist and very old buildings, where the local pub is still very much a local pub. There’s a strong sense of identity among the people who’ve made it their home, who appreciate its understated appeal and cherish its open-mindedness. It attracts wistful spirits: artists, writers, bohemians and people looking for new beginnings – exactly what my parents were trying to do when they moved there.</p> \n<p>My dad was coming through a miserable period of ill health, and my mother was recovering from the stresses of nursing him through it. He wasn’t a good patient. They needed change, and somewhere calm and hopeful where they could make new plans. Deal – which my father had visited on holidays as a little boy – offered them some much-needed solace.</p> \n<p>It also offered another thing they always pined for: seafood. An abundance of it. The best fish and chips I’ve ever tasted are from the Middle Street chippy – shiny flakes of firm, white fish, crusted in light, shatter-crisp golden batter. Tubs of buttery whelks and sweet prawns from a seafront van that my dad and I would snaffle on afternoon walks when I’d visit, followed by cones of ice-cream – mint choc chip for me and clotted cream for Dad.</p> \n<p>The town’s local fishmonger, Jenkins and Son, does sparklingly fresh seafood and beautiful day-boat fish, and wooden fishing boats line the shore, selling freshly caught sprats. But my love of fish and seafood predates the family’s move to Deal. We used to go on camping holidays to France and Spain, towing our <a href=\"http://www.365campingcaravanning.com/reviews_foldingcampers_tardis.htm\">Conway Tardis</a>, a sort of pumped-up hybrid of trailer tent and caravan – the assembling of which was a laborious rigmarole that brings to mind tense scenes from Mike Leigh’s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/85290/nuts-in-may\">Nuts in May</a>. Needless to say, we were always the only people in the campsite with a Tardis.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/06/summer-holiday-recipes-favourite-chefs-seafood-shellfish\">Our best summer holiday recipes | Cook</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We would usually camp in coastal areas, where my parents had a knack for sniffing out simple seafood restaurants and shacks where they could feast on the local haul. In Brittany, we’d beachcomb for cockles – walking along the flat, wet sand when the tide was out and looking for the dark grey spots with the two adjacent pin pricks that signified a mollusc burrowed below. I remember so clearly the addictive thrill of poking my finger down into the soft, silty sand and hitting shell, scooping it out and examining its perfect pleats on my palm. We’d also fill buckets and buckets with the little clams, soaking them for hours back at the campsite so they’d give up their grit and later steaming them open to douse in vinegar and white pepper.</p> \n<p>Back home in England, one of my dad’s summer rituals was to buy a live brown crab to dispatch and dress himself, spreading the kitchen table with newspaper and spending hours mining the shell methodically and meticulously for white and brown meat. We’d usually eat it simply with bread and butter, good mayonnaise and lemon juice, and I would often sit by him and watch the way he worked, swiping tastes here and there when he wasn’t looking.</p> \n<p>A taste for the sweet and nutty meat of brown crab has stayed with me, and I truly believe it’s one of the UK’s finest native ingredients. Brown crab is in season now so very easy to come by – live or dressed – from the fishmonger, and there’s also some very good pasteurised and vacuum-packed crabmeat now available in the supermarket. My crab mac and cheese recipe over the page makes the most out of a modest quantity of crab meat, playing on flavours of crab linguine and thermidor, while the ice cream below is inspired by those days with my dad. There’s no denying that rhubarb and custard has more than a whiff of summery seaside sweet shop about it.</p> \n<h2><strong><br />Crab macaroni cheese</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br />200g macaroni<br />20g unsalted butter<br />&frac12; tbsp olive oil<br />2 shallots, peeled and finely chopped <br />50g fennel, finely chopped<br />A handful of parsley, leaves and stalks, separated and finely chopped<br />Salt and black pepper<br />&frac12; tsp red chilli flakes or piment d’espelette<br />Juice and zest of half a lemon<br />1 tbsp flour<br />2 tbsp brandy<br />300ml milk<br />100g cheddar, grated<br />30g gruyere, grated, plus some extra to bake<br />250g crab meat – I like to use a mixture of white and brown<br />A grating of fresh nutmeg<br />A handful of dill, finely chopped<br />4 crab shells, washed (optional)</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"77d9b69851dc02c61be4a8c9f98a82c65568423b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436436741285/6b3d3867-948f-475f-b275-fe7fec189b13-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rosie's crab mac and cheese served in the shell with a side of samphire\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosie’s crab mac and cheese served in the shell.

Cook the macaroni in plenty of salted water until al dente, then drain, rinse under very cold water and set aside.</p> \n<p>2 Melt your butter with the olive oil over a medium heat. Add the chopped shallots, fennel and parsley stalks, with a pinch of salt, red chilli flakes and the lemon zest. Sweat them together for 5 minutes until sweet and fragrant but not brown. Add the flour. Cook, . for a minute or two, stirring to incorporate the flour into the shallot, butter and fennel. Add the brandy. Cook and stir to a paste-like roux. Add milk. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring with a whisk until the sauce is thick with no lumps. Add the cheeses and a good grating of fresh nutmeg and stir into the sauce until they’ve melted. If it’s too thick at this point, add a splash of water.</p> \n<p>3 Transfer to a bowl and add your crab meat, lemon juice, chopped dill, parsley leaves and the macaroni. Stir gently to combine. Season with salt and pepper and put into the crab shells or an enamel baking tray. Top with some more gruyere and bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and serve with the samphire.</p> \n<h2>Rhubarb and custard ice-cream<strong> with almond and white chocolate brittle (below)</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>For the rhubarb confit</strong><br />350g fresh rhubarb, washed, trimmed and cut into chunks<br />3 tbsp caster (superfine) sugar</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"714cdee09eb81b04825418efcdff5ed849f2c970\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436435881318/ebb632e2-c9d6-4167-94c1-6bf4bf83534b-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Rhubarb and custard ice-cream with almond and white chocolate brittle\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosie’s rhubarb and custard ice-cream with almond and white chocolate brittle.

Remove from the heat and set aside.</p> \n<p>2 To make the custard, heat the milk and vanilla pod in a heavy-based saucepan over a low heat until it’s just simmering. Remove from the heat and leave to infuse for 10 minutes.</p> \n<p>3 In a bowl, whisk the sugar and egg yolks for a couple of minutes until pale and fluffy. Remove the vanilla pod from the milk, scraping the seeds into the milk. Pour the infused milk into the egg mixture and whisk until incorporated. Pour the mixture back into the pan and return to a low heat. Cook, stirring, until the custard thickens and will coat the back of a wooden spoon. Do not allow it to boil. Transfer the custard to a bowl, cool and chill for at least 3 hours.</p> \n<p>4 To make the ice-cream, whip the double cream until it just reaches soft peaks. Stir in the custard and rhubarb, and then churn in an ice-cream machine according to the maker’s instructions, until thickened and frozen. Transfer to a freezer-proof container and freeze until you’re ready to serve.</p> \n<p>5 If you don’t have an ice-cream machine, you can still make this by pouring the mixture into a pre-chilled Tupperware container and freeze it for 2 hours, until the edges become icy. Then whisk well to break up any crystals. Freeze again until solidified. Repeat twice more.</p> \n<h2><strong>Almond and white chocolate brittle</strong></h2> \n<p>50g flaked almonds, toasted<br />150g caster sugar<br />30g white chocolate, chopped</p> \n<p>1 Spread your almonds and chopped white chocolate out in a single layer on a sheet of greaseproof paper on a baking tray.<br /></p> \n<p>2 Heat the sugar in a nonstick saucepan over a medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until melted and caramel-coloured. Do NOT put your finger anywhere near it. Pour the melted sugar over the almond and white chocolate, tilting the tray to spread it out thinly and evenly. Leave it to cool and set, and then break up into shards to serve with the ice-cream.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Rosie Birkett is a food writer, stylist, and author of A Lot On Her Plate (Hardie Grant). rosiebirkett.com; @rosiefoodie</em></li> \n</ul>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436435563329/0d2fa111-bdbd-4bd3-8864-3cd788b56d6b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian","altText":"Rosie Birkett staring into the middle distance.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Elena Heatherwick for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436436742621/2e56596c-3d95-4ed9-a09f-c58be626bd67-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rosie’s crab mac and cheese served in the shell.

Halve, peel and slice the onion. Add with the salt to the hot pan then reduce the heat and cook for ten minutes or so until soft. While the onions are cooking, peel and finely slice the garlic.<br /></p> \n<p>Stir through the garlic, chilli and herbs and cook for a minute, then add the tomatoes and their juices from the tins. Swill each of the emptied tins with a little water to get the last remnants of tomato and add this to the pan too. Increase the heat to high and simmer for a few minutes, avoiding the temptation to keep stirring. Then turn the heat down low and leave to reduce to a thick chunky texture. The longer you cook it, the better the sauce will be. I tend to leave it to simmer quietly for about 30 minutes to an hour while I make the meatballs.</p> \n<p>While the sauce is reducing, make the polpettine. Peel the onion and garlic, dicing the onion as finely as you can. Using a mortar and pestle, grind the garlic with the salt to a smooth paste. Pick and finely chop the rosemary and thyme leaves.</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 160C/gas mark 3 and lightly grease a baking tray.</p> \n<p>Put a pan on the heat with a little olive oil and sweat down the onion, garlic, rosemary and thyme. Once they’re completely soft, spread them over a plate and put it in the fridge to cool.</p> \n<p>Soak the bread in the milk in a shallow bowl for five to ten minutes until the milk has been absorbed. Grate the parmesan on a fine setting. Once softened, break the bread into small chunks with your hands and discard any leftover milk.</p> \n<p>Put the cooled onions and garlic, soaked bread, parmesan, mustard, beef and pork mince, chilli and nutmeg in a large bowl and mix together with your hands. Be careful not to overwork the mixture.</p> \n<p>I like meatballs to be light and juicy, and overworking results in a very dense and heavy meatball.

I loved it, and still do – sour cherries have a special place in my heart. In Sicily they make a mulberry granita that is exceptional, but it is hard to find black mulberries these days if you don’t have a tree. Morello cherries are my replacement – tarter, but just as full of fruity goodness, and full of happy memories.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>Morello cherries</strong> 500g, stemmed<br /><strong>water</strong> 600ml<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 175g</p> \n<p>Put everything into a pot, bring it almost to a simmer, turn it off immediately and leave to cool. Put the lot in a food processor (not a liquidiser, which would crush the cherry stones) and pur&eacute;e until the flesh has come from the pits, and broken down to a red liquid. Pass through a sieve, pressing down to extract the juice, and discard the stony residue. Pour the liquid into a deep tray that will fit in your freezer (metal is best, as it will conduct heat from the granita fastest – but this is only a question of time, rather than quality). Place it in your freezer, and check after half an hour. Once ice crystals start to form, stir every 15 minutes or so with a fork or sturdy balloon whisk until you have a thick slush. If it gets too hard, you can always thaw it a little before serving – and it can be stored this way (frozen solid) for weeks. Serve on a hot day.</p> \n<p>If you can’t get fresh Morello cherries, use cooked ones from jars, which can be liquidised and strained. Alternatively, use fresh, eating cherries and the method above. In either case, add sugar to taste if necessary, remembering the granita will taste slightly less sweet when frozen.<br /><em>From Bocca: Cookbook by Jacob Kenedy (Bloomsbury Publishing, &pound;30).

What I suggest is that you buy a decent stock of the stuff (along with farro, and any other more recondite pasta shapes you might be hankering after) in one go, so that you always have the wherewithal to hand.</p> \n<p>I wouldn’t substitute regular couscous for the fregola, which is rather more like dense pasta peas than semolina grains, and thus most comparable to the larger Middle Eastern or Israeli couscous, which could be used in its stead. However, if you can’t find fregola, I would suggest you try a chunky soup-pasta shape such as ditalini, which is more readily available.</p> \n<p>Fregola itself, though, brings a distinct quality: when cooked, it certainly softens but also retains a singular chewiness and nuttiness, which is perfect in this light but clam-rich, spiced and tomato-hued soup.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>small clams</strong> 1kg, such as palourdes<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 x 15ml tbsp<br /><strong>echalion or banana shallot </strong>1, peeled and finely chopped<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 2, peeled<br /><strong>dried chilli flakes</strong> &frac12; tsp<br /><strong>tomato puree</strong> 1 x 15ml tbsp<br /><strong>light chicken stock</strong> 750ml (made up with less powder or concentrate to water than usual)<br /><strong>dry red vermouth </strong>60ml<br /><strong>fregola</strong> 200g<br /><strong>parsley</strong> 3 x 15ml tbsp, plus more for sprinkling, chopped</p> \n<p>Soak the clams in a large bowl of cold water, and sort through them, discarding any shells that remain open or are cracked or smashed.<br /></p> \n<p>Heat the oil in a large, heavy-based pan that comes with a lid, then add the chopped shallot, stirring for a minute, grate in (or mince and add) the garlic, and add the chilli flakes, stirring again over the heat so that it sizzles, though not long enough to let the garlic brown.</p> \n<p>Stir in the tomato puree, then add the stock and the vermouth and let it come to the boil.</p> \n<p>Add the fregola – it should be covered completely by the liquid – and let it simmer, still uncovered, for 10-12 minutes (or as instructed on the fregola packet).</p> \n<p>Check that the fregola is nearly ready and then add the drained clams, and cover the pan with the lid. Leave to cook for 3 minutes at a fast simmer, then uncover the pan to check that the clams have opened. Any clams that, once cooked, stay closed should be discarded.</p> \n<p>Sprinkle in the chopped parsley and stir to let everything combine before ladling into 4 warmed bowls to serve, sprinkling with a little more chopped parsley as you go.</p> \n<p><em>From Nigellissima: Instant Italian Inspiration by Nigella Lawson (Chatto &amp; Windus, &pound;14.99). </em><em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/nigellissima.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Click here to buy it from Guardian Bookshop for &pound;11.99</a></em></p> \n<h2>Giorgio Locatelli’s baked aubergine with cheese</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11f7a010b9b58ccac7d1d43dac7b8bd0dfe2c584\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435676524828/c2ee960b-7e9c-450b-b977-78f8ccca4a1f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Melanzane alla Parmigiana\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><br /></h2> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>aubergines</strong> 4 large<br /><strong>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>olive oil<br /></strong><strong>ripe plum tomatoes</strong> 16<br /><strong>garlic oil </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>sugar</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>eggs</strong> 4 large, hard-boiled, cut into quarters<br /><strong>tuma (Sicilian fresh unsalted sheep’s cheese) or mozzarella</strong> 150g, cut into small cubes<br /><strong>fresh basil</strong> a bunch<br /><strong>caciocavallo or pecorino cheese</strong> 50g, grated</p> \n<p>Cut the aubergines into slices lengthways, about 6mm thick.

The peppers, which are bigger than the more common variety, have a sweetness when roasted akin to tomatoes. They provide a freshness in the antipasti which works brilliantly before the more heavy meat-based ‘primi’ and ‘secondi’. The jarred tuna stems from Liguria originally – a region neighbouring Piedmont. This tuna is packed in the light olive oil of the region and gives the Piemontese an intake of fish which is otherwise not available in this mountainous land.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>red peppers</strong> 4 large<br /><strong>olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>For the tonnato<br /><strong>good quality tuna in olive oil</strong> 2 x 225g jar<br /><strong>tinned anchovies</strong> 6<br /><strong>capers</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>egg yolks</strong> 2<br /><strong>salt </strong>a small pinch<br /><strong>lemon</strong> a small squeeze</p> \n<p>Roast the peppers on a very high heat in the oven (around 200C-220C/gas mark 6-7) until the skins start to blacken. Remove from the oven and place the peppers into a large bowl and cover with cling film. The steam will help release the skins.<br /></p> \n<p>Once cool enough to handle, cut in half, peel the skins and remove all the seeds. Trim up the edges so it is neat. You now should have 2 halves of pepper per person to serve.</p> \n<p>Place the tuna in a blender with all of the oil from the jar and blend with the anchovies, capers and egg yolks to a smooth consistency. Season with salt and lemon juice.</p> \n<p>The tonnato should have a smooth consistency. You may need to add a small glug of olive oil when finishing the blitzing to achieve the correct texture.</p> \n<p>Now assemble it. The idea is to place some tuna on the inside of the pepper pieces and roll them up – you can be quite generous. The most traditional garnish for this dish is a simple lamb’s lettuce salad.</p> \n<p><em>Sam Harris is chef patron of Zucca, London SE1; </em><a href=\"http://zuccalondon.com\"><em>zuccalondon.com</em></a></p> \n<h2>Claudia Roden’s courgette blossoms fried in batter</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"891cb81a765dabc5563ec79460342e507896b5b4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435676696750/44d49c42-2cee-47ae-bd9c-6c5e46ca8e08-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Courgette Flowers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Poole for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the simplest and most popular version of one of the most delightful of dishes.

Apart from a minimal amount of fat required to brown the meat, it has only two components: a loin of pork, and milk. As they slowly cook together, they are transformed. The pork acquires a delicacy of texture and flavour that leads some to mistake it for veal, and the milk disappears to be replaced by clusters of delicious, nut-brown sauce.</p> \n<p>The cut of meat specified includes the rib bones to which the pork’s loin is attached. Have the butcher detach the meat in one piece from the ribs and split the ribs into 2 or 3 parts. By having had the loin boned, you can brown it more thoroughly, and by cooking it along with the bones, the roast benefits from the substantial contribution the bones make.</p> \n<p>Another cut of pork that is well suited to this dish is the boneless role of muscle at the base of the neck, known as boned and rolled neck or blade. There is a layer of fat in the centre that runs the length of the muscle. It makes this cut very juicy and tasty, but when you carve it later, the slices tend to break apart where the meat joins the fat. If you don’t think this would be a problem you can substitute 1 kilo of it in one piece for the rib roast.</p> \n<p>Do not have any fat trimmed away. It will melt in the cooking, basting the meat and keeping it from drying. When the roast is done, you will be able to draw it off from the pot and discard it.</p> \n<p>Serves 6<br /><strong>butter</strong> 15g<br /><strong>vegetable oil</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>pork loin rib roast</strong> 1.2kg (see note above)<br /><strong>salt<br /></strong><strong>freshly ground pepper<br /></strong><strong>full-cream milk</strong> 575ml or more</p> \n<p>Heat the butter and oil over a medium-high heat in a casserole just large enough to contain the pork. When the butter foam subsides, add the meat, fat side down. Brown thoroughly on all sides lowering the heat if the butter starts to turn dark brown.<br /></p> \n<p>Add the salt, pepper and 250ml of the milk. Add the milk slowly lest it boil over. Allow the milk to come to a brisk simmer for 20 or 30 seconds, turn the heat down to medium-low and cover the pot with the lid on slightly askew.</p> \n<p>Cook at a very lazy simmer for about 1 hour, until the milk has thickened into a light nut-brown sauce. (The exact time it will take depends largely on the heat of your burner and the thickness of your pot.) When the milk reaches this stage, and not before, add another 250ml of the milk, let it simmer for about 10 minutes, then cover the pot putting the lid on tightly. Check and turn the pork from time to time.</p> \n<p>After 30 minutes, set the lid slightly askew. Continue to cook at minimum heat and, when you see there is no more liquid milk in the pot, add the remaining milk. Continue cooking until the meat feels tender when prodded with a fork and all the milk has coagulated into small nut-brown clusters. Altogether it will take between 2&frac12; and 3 hours. If, before the meat is fully cooked, you find that the liquid in the pot has evaporated, add another 100ml of milk, repeating the step if it should become necessary.</p> \n<p>When the pork has become tender and all the milk in the pot has thickened into dark clusters, transfer the meat to a cutting board. Let it settle for a few minutes, then cut into slices about 1cm thick or slightly less, and arrange them on a warm serving platter.</p> \n<p>Tip the pot and spoon off most of the fat – there may be as much as a mugful of it – being careful to leave behind all the coagulated milk clusters. Add 2 or 3 tablespoons of water and boil away the water over a high heat, at the same time using a wooden spoon to scrape loose the cooking residues from the bottom and sides of the pot. Spoon all the pot juices over the pork and serve immediately.</p> \n<p><em>From The Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking by Marcella Hazan (Boxtree, &pound;30). </em><em><a

By Nigel Slater","standFirst":"<p>Chewy, nutty and wholesome, freekeh is a super grain – and it really comes alive when combined with smooth avocado and spiky chives</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<h2>The recipe</h2> \n<p>Put a pan of water on to boil. Rinse 150g of freekeh in cold water, then add to the boiling water and leave to cook for 40-45 minutes until tender but slightly chewy. Drain the cooked freekeh and set aside.</p> \n<p>Peel 180g of cucumber, halve lengthways and remove the seeds, then cut the flesh into small dice. Finely chop eight chives (roughly 2 tbsp). Halve, stone and peel a ripe but firm avocado, then cut into small cubes.</p> \n<p>Warm 2 tbsp of olive oil in a shallow pan, add 2 tsp of ras el hanout and let it warm through. (It is already roasted, so a minute or two over heat is long enough.) Add a 400ml can of chickpeas, drained, and the cooked and drained wheat to the pan, together with a little salt. When the chickpeas are hot stir in the chopped cucumber, chives and avocado. Stir only gently – you don’t want to crush the avocado. Trickle over a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar and serve. Enough for 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>Freekeh is whole roasted wheat. It can take a good 45 minutes to cook, but check it after 30. It should still be nutty and enjoyably chewy. I find it best to salt it after cooking rather than adding salt to the cooking water, which sometimes seems to toughen it.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>All manner of grains can be substituted for the freekeh, such as barley or rye, but the cooking times will vary according to which grain you choose. Whole grains, such as pot barely, will take longer to come to tenderness than pearl barley. Use this salad as a base for adding other ingredients as you wish, such as chopped tomatoes, mint or spring onions. You can add feta or grated ricotta salata, the aged and salted sheep’s cheese, if you wish. I sometimes add lemon juice to the warm oil and vinegar dressing.</p> \n<p><br />Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435664438939/Freekeh-with-avocado-and--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nigel Slater's freekeh with avocado and chives recipe.

It is a summer dish, which you would make when tomatoes and basil were good and plentiful.<br /></p> \n<p>If you want to make it the day before you eat it, the flavours will have longer to infuse and it will taste even better.</p> \n<p>When you cook the sardines, it is very important to get your griddle pan really hot, otherwise the sardines will stick and you won’t be able to turn them without them breaking up.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>sardines</strong> 12 large<br /><strong>extra-virgin olive oil </strong>5 tbsp</p> \n<p>For the panzanella<br /><strong>stale Tuscan bread or ciabatta</strong> 200g, without crusts, torn up<br /><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 4 tbsp<br /><strong>tomatoes on the vine</strong> 3<br /><strong>red onion</strong> 1 large, cut into 2cm dice<br /><strong>basil</strong> a big bunch<br /><strong>extra-virgin olive oil</strong> 5 tbsp<br /><strong>salt and pepper</strong></p> \n<p>First, get a griddle pan smoking-hot, otherwise the sardines won’t release their fat and will stick to the pan.<br /></p> \n<p>To make the panzanella: soak the bread in the vinegar. Take the tomatoes from the vine, dice and add to the bread, together with the chopped onion. Tear the basil and add that too. Add the olive oil and season with salt and pepper. Stir together and set aside.</p> \n<p>Under running water, scale the sardines and then open them out, leaving the heads attached. To do this, insert a sharp filleting knife at the tail end, next to the backbone, and cut upwards, until you reach the belly of the fish. Turn the sardine over, then cut in the same way to the same point on the other side of the bone. Starting at the tail end, take the backbone between your forefinger and thumb and run them along the length of the bone up to the head. Cut across the bone at the tail end and head end and the bone should lift out, leaving the fillets still attached at the opposite side, so you can open them out like a book. At the outside of each fillet, you will see a black area with some fine bones. Just take your knife under these parts, and remove them. Then, with a pair of tweezers, take out any pin bones that may have remained in the fillets.</p> \n<p>When all the sardines are prepared, season, brush with a little of the olive oil and put on the hot grill, 6 at a time. Let them get crusty on one side (about 3 minutes), then turn over and do the same on the other side (about 2 minutes).</p> \n<p>While the sardines are cooking, spoon some of the panzanella on each serving plate, then put the sardines on top, drizzle with the remaining olive oil and serve.</p> \n<p><em>From Made in Italy by Giorgio Locatelli (Fourth Estate, &pound;26).</em><em><a

The table would be covered with a linen cloth and napkins, which she had woven from linen she had spun 35 years previously, as part of her bottom drawer. To start she would bring a steaming bowl of stracciatelle soup, the broth made from a free-range chicken. To follow, the boiled chicken would be served with extra-virgin olive oil, freshly ground black pepper and home-cured black olives, ulive strinate, a speciality of the Marche region. The freshly picked black olives are put in a sack with sea salt and hung outside for 40 days in the frosty weather.

It’s a lovely way of celebrating good-quality basil, and for me is very much a summer dish. It makes a delicious first course or a one-plate meal, especially with the addition of French beans.</p> \n<p>Making pesto properly is another good case for slow food because it should ideally be made shortly before it is eaten. It is also one of the many recipes where you need to be very flexible in terms of quantities; tasting and adjusting them during preparation is a must.</p> \n<p>To my mind there is no substitute for pounding by hand, and I recommend using a marble pestle and mortar. Pesto made in a food processor tends to require extra olive oil and in my view, the machine is too harsh on the ingredients, making both the texture and flavour somewhat insipid.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>trenette or linguine</strong> 320-400g<br /><strong>basil leaves</strong> 4<br /><strong>french beans</strong> 200g, topped and tailed (optional)<br /><strong>pesto alla Genovese</strong> 8 tbsp (see below)<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano PDO</strong> 60g</p> \n<p>For the pesto<br /><strong>fresh basil</strong> 4 bunches, ideally PDO Genoese, good Proven&ccedil;al or home-grown outdoors<br /><strong>garlic cloves</strong> 1-2, preferably Imperia from Vessalico, or French pink or violet varieties, such as ail rose de Lautrec<br /><strong>pine nuts </strong>30g<br /><strong>coarse sea salt </strong>10g, ideally sale di Cervia<br /><strong>parmigiano reggiano cheese (aged 24 months)</strong> 30-40g, grated<br /><strong>fiore sardo (pecorino sardo) cheese </strong>40-50g, grated<br /><strong>PDO extra virgin olive oil from Liguria</strong> 50-70ml</p> \n<p>To make the pesto, wash the basil leaves in cold water and dry them on a tea towel but without rubbing. The following steps must be done as quickly as possible to avoid oxidation.</p> \n<p>Put the garlic and pine nuts in a mortar and pound with the pestle until smooth.</p> \n<p>Add a few grains of the salt and some of the basil leaves, then pound the mixture, using a light circular movement of the pestle against the sides of the mortar. Repeat this process until all the basil has been pounded.</p> \n<p>When the basil drips bright green liquid, add both cheeses and mix well. Pour a thin layer of the oil over the pesto and mix very lightly.</p> \n<p>Cook the pasta in plenty of boiling, well salted water until al dente. If you plan to add beans, put them in the water at the same time as the pasta. When ready, drain the pasta, then return it to the saucepan. Add 8 tablespoons of pesto and stir well so that the pasta is fully coated.</p> \n<p>Serve in pasta plates and place a basil leaf in the centre of each portion. Grate some parmigiano on top before eating.</p> \n<p><em>From Semplice by Dino Joannides (Preface Publishing, &pound;25). <a

you pickle a bowl of cherries they add a glorious sweet-and-sour kick to ham and fish dishes</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>Aside from a soft-crusted, sugar-dusted pie, there is little reason to cook a cherry. A jam, glowing jewel-like on the breakfast table, can be a fine thing if you have bothered to remove the stones; hell if you haven’t. But, other than that, cherries are best eaten from the bag or, better still, served cold, in a bowl of ice cubes that you have crushed to a near slush-puppy texture.</p> \n<p>An exception is a pickled cherry. A snap of sweet and sour to bring out the best in a slice of ham, a fillet of oily fish such as a tuna steak or a fillet of silver-skinned mackerel. When I say pickled, I don’t mean the fruit should be kept lurking in a jar of malt vinegar and spices for six months. I mean a quick 20-minute pickle, bright as a button, with star anise, black peppercorns, mild red wine and vinegar, and just enough sugar to stop your lips smarting.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week I simmered a ham in apple juice and served the amber broth with a dose of pickled cherries. The faintly salty cooking liquor and sour cherries were a perfect balance for the sweet, thick-cut meat and fat. An initial boiling in water prevented an over-salty broth. Skimming the surface regularly kept the juices clear and bright.</p> \n<p>The next day we ate the ham cold, cut thinner this time, with a spinach salad (dressing: cider vinegar, walnut oil, grain mustard, lemon juice) with more of the cherries and their juice. Afterwards, greedy for more of the pickled fruit, we ate thick yogurt sweetened with whipped cream, a pinch of sugar and the meanest seasoning of ground cinnamon. We then tipped a tiny spoonful of the cherries over the folds of creamy, spice-flecked yogurt.</p> \n<h2>Pickled cherries</h2> \n<p>I used dark, sweet dessert cherries for this. If you are using sour fruit, then add a little more sugar. Makes 500g of pickled cherries.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>cherries </strong>500g<strong> </strong><br /><strong>red-wine vinegar </strong>125ml<br /><strong>red wine</strong> 375ml<br /><strong>sugar </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>black peppercorns </strong>1 tsp<br /><strong>star anise </strong>2 whole<strong> </strong><br /></p> \n<p>Pull the cherries from their stalks, then halve each fruit and remove the stones. Put the stoned cherries into a stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan then pour in the vinegar and red wine and bring to the boil. Stir in the sugar, the peppercorns and the star anise then lower the heat so the liquid bubbles gently for 3 or 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the mixture to cool.</p> \n<h2>Grilled mackerel, pickled cherries and samphire</h2> \n<p>The sour pickling juice of the cherries does the work of lemon juice here, balancing the oily richness of the fish. A few spoonfuls over the hot fish are as important as the cherries themselves.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>mackerel fillets </strong>4<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>samphire </strong>2 handfuls<br /><strong>pickled cherries </strong>6 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>Check the mackerel fillets for any stray bones, then place them skin-side down on a lined grill pan. Brush them lightly with olive oil, then season with a little salt. Cook under an overhead grill or over the bars of a hot grill for four minutes on each side until lightly cooked through. (The advantage of cooking over a grill is that you will have crisp skin, too, but an overhead grill works well enough.)</p> \n<p>Rinse the samphire in cold running water and trim any tough roots. Put the samphire in a bowl and add the cherries and their juices. Toss the cherries and samphire and leave for a few minutes while the mackerel cooks. Place a bed of samphire and cherries on two plates, spoon over the cherry pickling liquor, then place a couple of fillets on each. Spoon over a little more pickling liquor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dcc71522b93afbfb41333d5575e4833d8d7d40b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661454346/430168d5-e760-48e1-bd70-2e071f686d58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Slater's gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe on a round plate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: Nigel Slater’s gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe.

Do this twice if you fear your ham is on the salty side. Serves 4<br /></p> \n<p><strong>ham or gammon joint </strong>1.5kg, rolled and tied<br /><strong>water </strong>1 litre<br /><strong>apple juice </strong>1 litre<br /><strong>bay leaves </strong>2<br /><strong>peppercorns </strong>10<br /><strong>cloves </strong>4<br /></p> \n<p>To finish<br /><strong>cooking liquor </strong>from the ham <br /><strong>pickled cherries </strong>12 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>Put the piece of gammon in a large, deep pan, cover with cold water and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat so the water doesn’t boil over, and leave to cook for 20 minutes.</p> \n<p>Carefully pour the water away and return the pan to the heat. Pour in the litre of water and the apple juice, then tuck in the bay leaves. Add the peppercorns and cloves and bring to the boil. If any froth comes to the surface, remove it with a draining spoon. When every bit of froth has been removed and the liquid is clear, lower the heat so it bubbles gently, then partially cover with a lid.</p> \n<p>Let the gammon cook for about 60-90 minutes, checking the liquid level from time to time and turning the meat carefully once or twice to ensure even cooking. Switch off the heat but leave the meat in the cooking liquor.</p> \n<p>Lift the meat out and place it on a carving board. Taste the cooking liquid, correct the seasoning if necessary. Carve the meat into thick slices and put two or three per person into shallow dishes or deep plates. Ladle some of the cooking broth over each then add 2 or 3 tablespoons of pickled cherries and some of their liquid over each. Serve with spoons.</p> \n<p><br />Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></p> \n<p>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661339936/Grilled-mackerel-pickled--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A cherry on top: Nigel Slater's grilled mackerel, pickled cherries and samphire recipe.
