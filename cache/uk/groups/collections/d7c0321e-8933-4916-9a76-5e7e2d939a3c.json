Chucking a load of ingredients into the pan and hoping for the best doesn’t really wash here, however hard you scrub.</p> \n<p>Softer and crumblier than toffee, smoother and richer than its close relative, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jan/22/how-to-make-perfect-tablet-recipe\">tablet</a>, its dairy content means fudge is associated particularly with the south-west, though shops churning it out in a mind-boggling array of weird and only occasionally wonderful flavours are de rigueur in tourist honeypots throughout the British Isles.

If you want to keep things simple, like candy <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">pros Mrs Hope and Mr Greenwood</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">folk from Rodda’s clotted cream</a> and <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/caramel-mousse-recipe\">Michelin-star chef Tom Aikens</a>, this can be caster or ordinary white granulated, but given sugar plays such a large part, the demerara suggested by the <a href=\"https://www.carnation.co.uk/recipes/67/Ultimate-Fudge\">Carnation condensed milk tin</a> or the light muscovado used by <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/creamy-sea-salted-fudge-recipe/#ftsTEEwRpKOcplKw.97\">Ren Behan in Jamie magazine</a> will give a more interesting flavour. Personally, I prefer the slightly more subtle caramel notes of the first here.</p> \n<p>Aikens and Roddas both also add some sugar syrup – boring glucose in the former case, ambrosial golden in the latter – which makes their fudge wonderfully smooth as opposed to the slightly gritty, sandy texture of the Carnation and Hope and Greenwood recipes, which, though undoubtedly pleasing, is more reminiscent of Scottish tablet. Clearly feeling two types of sugar aren’t quite enough, Aikens finishes his fudge with an infinitesimal amount of icing sugar, for, no doubt, very sound Michelin-starred reasons which I am unable to fathom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15f50824423376fe7324855e6d5deb45f925ddde\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945143833/02911193-5340-4c62-9f42-70adb1e18073-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roddas's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roddas’s fudge goes all out with clotted cream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The dairy</h2> \n<p>The second, and most important, ingredient in fudge is fat. Dairy fat to be precise. Some recipes cleverly combine the two ingredients in one big hit of nauseatingly delicious condensed milk, which makes their fudge taste distinctly like white chocolate – not that there’s anything wrong with this, but it’s not the classic flavour I’m after.</p> \n<p>Hope and Greenwood plump for the nostalgic boiled flavour of evaporated milk instead, an ingredient that has so far failed to reinvent itself for a more decadent age. Despite a weird complaint that it tastes “meaty”, I happen to like it, but not as much as the clotted cream which plays an unsurprisingly large part in the Roddas recipe, or the double variety in Aikens’s fudge.</p> \n<p>In fact, the Roddas recipe proves pretty popular; soft, smooth and rich, it’s classic Cornish seaside stuff. My only complaint is that the flavour is a little too sweet and rich, which I admit may sound ridiculous, but in a side-by-side comparison, we preferred those recipes using butter as well. Let’s be honest, everything’s better with butter. But, as butter and clotted cream could prove a fatal combination, a downgrade to double seems just what the doctor ordered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb2e571089756166bf95884fb673baae2a7c905b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945257884/e7b22b5b-562c-436a-b61f-86987205051f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ren Behan's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ren Behan’s recipes uses vanilla extract.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The flavouring</h2> \n<p>Though to make this a fair test I omit Hope and Greenwood’s peanut butter (anything containing peanut butter is always going to win big for me), I do allow Roddas, Behan and Aikens their vanilla. Not strictly necessary for a satisfactory result, but a lovely combination of flavours nevertheless – and this is one place where I think vanilla extract works better than those fiddly little seeds. Salt is another must – as ever, it brings out the best in the sugar, keeping it just the right side of sickly. How much you add depends on how enthusiastically you have embraced salted caramel mania over the last few years; sceptics will be content with a pinch, salt fiends like myself should up the dosage considerably. In for a penny, in for a pound.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28087b3b2da0edb1419a066bbbc37cab6d8e9da5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945369181/d110d9e0-c45d-47e4-9883-ecdc4f5be5c9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Aikens fudge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Aikens uses a high temperature to produce a more brittle fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>All the recipes I try start in much the same way, dissolving the sugar and dairy together over heat, bringing the resulting mixture to the boil, and then letting it simmer until it reaches the desired setting temperature. (Covering the pan, as Roddas suggest, works fine, but feels a bit scary to me; I prefer to keep my molten sugar where I can see it.)</p> \n<p>The difference comes in temperature, which ranges from 113C from Behan, which gives a very soft, almost fondant-like result, to Aikens’s 121C, which is brittle and chewy, more like a hard caramel than a fudge. Even Hope and Greenwood and Carnation’s 118C is a bit harder than I had expect from a fudge – my testers and I agree that Roddas have hit the sweet spot at 116C: firm enough to hold its shape, soft enough to melt in the mouth.</p> \n<p>Lots of recipes give advice about how to achieve this without a sugar thermometer (dropping a little into a glass of cold water until it reaches a pliable consistency), but this is a fiddly and inexact science, so I’d recommend investing in a sugar thermometer. They’re not expensive, and they’ll work forever (though be careful when washing as they can be delicate).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff868836c9b6e7193c7f55d0a3b6ca6c64059f29\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945538506/71cf141a-be66-4573-94d9-0c1097f9e045-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hope &amp; Greenwood's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hope &amp; Greenwood’s fudge has a slightly gritty texture.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Stirring?</h2> \n<p>Fudge, like tablet, is beaten as it cools to help it thicken. Behan suggests allowing it to cool a little before doing this, but I can’t see that it makes much difference, apart from making it dangerously tempting to sample (still not a good idea, however tough you think your tongue is). Once it’s set completely, however, it’s every man for himself. I cannot be held responsible for the consequences. Add chopped nuts, dried fruit, crisp nuggets of streaky bacon … your call.</p> \n<h2>The perfect fudge</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1ffc0ad8082f6feb097654dd62cb6a614aaf625\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434004392334/11b8acb2-0705-4248-a43a-41958b7cd118-460x318.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"318\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>(makes 1 x 23x23cm tin)</em></p> \n<p>100g butter<br />550g demerara sugar<br />200g golden syrup<br />350ml double cream<br />1 tsp vanilla extract<br />&frac14;-&frac12; tsp sea salt flakes</p> \n<p>Melt the butter, sugar and syrup and cream in a medium, high-sided heavy-based pan, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.

Pod 400g of broad beans (you will probably get about 100g of beans). Bring a deep pan of water to the boil, salt it lightly, then add the beans. Cook for 5-8 minutes depending on size, then drain them and refresh under cold running water.</p> \n<p>Put 150g of white basmati rice in a bowl, cover it with warm water, then rinse it using your fingertips, and pour off the water. Put the rice in a saucepan, add a bay leaf, eight black peppercorns and a couple of cloves. Tuck in a peeled clove of garlic, then cover with twice the volume of water and bring to the boil. Add a little salt, cover tightly and leave to simmer for 10 minutes or until small, deep holes have appeared in the surface. Remove from the heat and leave, covered, for 5 minutes.</p> \n<p>Roughly chop three tablespoons of dill fronds. Remove the lid from the rice, remove the bay leaves and cloves and stir in two-thirds of the chopped dill. Pour four tablespoons of olive into a bowl and season. Add the rest of the dill. Transfer the rice on to a serving plate, add the thick-cut slices of lamb then spoon over the dill dressing. Serves 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>Cold roast meats are best served at room temperature, so remove them from the fridge at least half an hour before serving. Rinse the rice thoroughly in warm water to wash away any loose starch. I do this three times, ensuring the rice grains do not stick. The rice is cooked when deep holes have appeared on the surface and the water has disappeared. Run a fork through the rice before serving to separate the grains.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>Any cold meat will work here. Add herbs to suit what you have: swap the dill for basil if using roast beef, and use young tarragon leaves for chicken. For pork, try half parsley and half basil with a splash of cider vinegar or lemon juice in with the olive oil.</p> \n<p><br /><em>Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></em></p> \n<p><em>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433252204694/Nigel-Slaters-lamb-with-b-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Have a rice day: Nigel Slater's lamb with basmati rice and dill recipe.

A frozen cheese and herb ice for a hot summer’s day, not to stuff into a cornet, but to spread on toast, to eat with slices of air-dried ham, or to sit at the side of a tomato and basil salad.</p> \n<p>I wanted to sweeten the ice, partly as this helps to improve the texture. Sugar seemed inappropriate. Honey, on the other hand, stood out as a natural candidate. A trickle of liquid honey makes a fine addition to a soft, bloomy goat’s cheese – particularly those with a hint of thyme or rosemary to them. So honey it was, a little being first warmed with thyme leaves then folded into the goat’s yogurt with the crumbled cheese. I could, to be honest, have added more, but the plan was always to use the ice cream to spread on bread and eat with a slice of ham, so I used just enough to balance the sourness and to give a backnote of honey. No machine necessary for this, by the way.</p> \n<p>Talking of sourness, rhubarb is abundant in the shops at the moment, and deserves a life beyond crumble. I use it mostly in conjunction with custard, either as stewed fruit, in a trifle or a posset, or in a tart filled with pastry cream. Today it was rhubarb and custard’s turn in the ice-cream machine. The point of rhubarb, at least for me, is its bracing sourness, and that can be lost among the sugar and cream of an ice. I got round this by reserving some of the juice, and pouring it over the ice cream as we ate.</p> \n<h2>Rhubarb ice cream</h2> \n<p>Serves 6<br />For the custard:<br /><strong>single cream</strong> 500ml<br /><strong>vanilla extract</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>egg </strong>5 yolks<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 4 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>For the rhubarb:<br /><strong>rhubarb</strong> 600g<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 75g<br /><strong>water</strong> 100ml</p> \n<p>Make the custard first. Pour the cream into a medium-sized nonstick saucepan, then add the vanilla extract and bring to the boil. Beat the egg yolks and sugar until thick and creamy, then pour over the hot milk and stir to mix. Wipe the saucepan clean, place it over a low to moderate heat and pour in the sugar, egg and cream mixture. Stir gently with a wooden spoon, letting the mixture heat through, but stay just short of coming to a boil. (If it boils, the custard will curdle.) As the mixture thickens, stir almost continuously until it is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon.</p> \n<p>Reduce the temperature of the custard quickly, by pouring it into a chilled bowl, beating quickly to let the steam escape. Leave the custard to cool, then chill it in the fridge.</p> \n<p>To cook the rhubarb, cut it into short lengths (about the size of a wine cork), then pack them into a medium-sized saucepan. Scatter over the caster sugar, pour in the water and bring it to the boil. Lower the heat, partially cover the pan with a lid, then leave the rhubarb to simmer for 5 to 10 minutes until it is tender and soft.</p> \n<p>Pour the rhubarb syrup from the pan into a bowl or jug and set it aside. Process the rhubarb to a thick pur&eacute;e – either in a food processor or a blender. Chill the juice and the pur&eacute;e.</p> \n<p>Stir the chilled custard and pur&eacute;e together, pour it into the bowl of an ice-cream machine and leave to churn. If you are not using a machine, then pour the mixture into a chilled freezer box and freeze for a couple of hours. Stir the frozen edges into the liquid middle and return to the freezer every hour. It should take about 4 hours to freeze.</p> \n<p>To serve, place spoonfuls or balls of ice cream into bowls then spoon over the chilled rhubarb syrup.</p> \n<h2>Goat’s cheese ice cream</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a255f57592ae8d5b0cb025f5f1db78590ca25676\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433323745411/2a3ff5f3-3ba0-4f25-9c1b-e4c65a8c174c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chilled out: goat’s cheese ice cream with air-dried ham.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chilled out: goat’s cheese ice cream with air-dried ham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This ice is made especially to be eaten with thin slices of charcuterie.

A good strawberry’s zing, flavour complexity and divine sweetness makes my eyes close reflexively and remember the time when I used to pick them in the fields as a child.</p> \n<p>I used to work on a strawberry farm in Thorncombe in Dorset, picking with travellers and locals from my village. We were paid by the punnet: some people were making as much as &pound;80 a day – picking furiously, bent over in the sun – a reasonable wage for five hours’ work in 1995. We’d pick from early morning until the sun got too hot. I was only 15 so had a slightly more laidback philosophy of “one for me, one for you” - “you” being the punnet. Every now and again I would come across a strawberry ripened to perfection and gobble it down.</p> \n<p>Summer strawberries are here and it was so worth the wait. Fruit undoubtedly tastes best when it is in season, but there is also a psychological change that comes into play when we haven’t tasted an ingredient for a long period of time. Strawberries are a prime example of this and taste infinitely better when eaten in season. The anticipation of their flavour and the memories this invokes all add to the enjoyment we experience when the season comes around again.</p> \n<p>Of course, a strawberry is perfect as it is, eaten unadulterated, bitten directly from the stalk. But, after the initial gorge, it’s time to start experimenting with them, making the most of the seasonal glut. Marinating strawberries in grappa (or macerating) really intensifies their flavour and is a good way to preserve an abundance of soft fruit. These will keep in the fridge for up to five days and can be used as a base ingredient for a number of other delicious recipes.</p> \n<h2><strong>To macerate your strawberries</strong></h2> \n<p>1200g strawberries<br />8 tbsp grappa<br />4 tsp caster sugar, plus extra to serve</p> \n<p><strong>1 </strong>Hull the strawberries by pulling off the green tops (cut them if they are under-ripe.)</p> \n<p><strong>2 </strong>Cut the strawberries in half from top to tail. Put them in a bowl with the grappa and caster sugar. Allow them to sit in the fridge for 30 minutes – all the juices will begin to seep out and the strawberries will soften. Turn every now and again to cover them with grappa.</p> \n<h2><strong>1.&nbsp;The classic dessert:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Sourdough summer pudding&nbsp;</strong><strong>(pictured above)</strong></h2> \n<p>An all-time summer favourite of mine and so quick to assemble. I like to experiment with different fillings and fruits. Summer pudding is best made the day before so the bread can soak up the juices and completely set.

Thanks to modern technology, we&nbsp;can now get them for much longer than their natural season, and with no loss of flavour (which is,&nbsp;sadly, not the case with strawberries): freezing peas and broad beans arrests the process that&nbsp;turns their natural sugars into starch, keeping them sweet. Even so, there’s a lot to be said for buying them fresh and enjoying their season, not least because children, in particular, seem to enjoy the lovely, meditative task of podding and shelling. Oh,&nbsp;who am I&nbsp;kidding? I&nbsp;love it, too.</p> \n<h2>Spaghetti with squid, peas and&nbsp;chilli</h2> \n<p>Beautifully simple flavours yet full of punch. The colours and contrast of the garlicky squid, sharp lemon and chilli bite make this ideal for hot, sunny days. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>400-500g fresh squid, cleaned (ask the fishmonger to do this, if need be), tubes and tentacles left whole</strong><br /><strong>300g fresh or frozen peas</strong><br /><strong>300g spaghetti</strong><br /><strong>6 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil (the best you can afford)</strong><br /><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>3 cloves garlic, peeled and sliced fine</strong><br /><strong>1 small handful marjoram leaves, finely&nbsp;chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 small dried red chillies, crumbled </strong><br /><strong>Zest and juice of 1 lemon</strong><br /><strong>1 handful mint leaves, finely chopped</strong></p> \n<p>Cut open each squid tube and open&nbsp;their bodies like a book. Scrape&nbsp;out any remaining residue inside with a&nbsp;knife, then finely slice the bodies into strips and pat dry with kitchen paper. Cut the tentacles into thirds or quarters.</p> \n<p>Bring a pan of water to a boil, blanch the peas for a couple of minutes, until just done, and drain.</p> \n<p>Bring a large pan of well-salted water to a rolling boil and cook the spaghetti until al dente, then drain, reserving some of the cooking water, to help finish the sauce.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, put a large, heavy-bottomed frying pan on a high heat and add half the olive oil. Throw the squid into the pan, season generously and stir-fry for a minute. Add the garlic, marjoram, peas and chilli, stir-fry for a few minutes more, until the squid is tender and starting to brown at the edges and the garlic is cooked. Scatter over the lemon zest, juice and mint, and stir to&nbsp;combine.</p> \n<p>Toss the squid through the cooked spaghetti, then pour on the remaining oil and a few tablespoons of reserved cooking water. Quickly toss to combine, season to taste and serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Morcilla with broad beans and mint on toast</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37f9d8cb0c7e40306843bb98ed80d95c361124dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432643680328/94e9e443-c3d3-4b32-9c5a-6603eb43443d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Thomasina Miers' morcilla with broad beans and mint on toast: 'Simple, gutsy and hard to stop eating.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomasina Miers’ morcilla with broad beans and mint on toast: ‘Simple, gutsy and hard to stop eating.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian. Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The gutsy, earthy flavour of black pudding is delicious with young, sweet broad beans. This is my favourite type of food: simple, gutsy&nbsp;and hard to stop eating. If&nbsp;you&nbsp;can’t find young, small beans,&nbsp;use peas; old broad beans tend to be bitter. Likewise, if you can’t get&nbsp;morcilla, use black pudding.&nbsp;Serves four as a&nbsp;first course.</p> \n<p><strong>250g shelled young broad beans, fresh or frozen </strong><br /><strong>30g butter</strong><br /><strong>1 leek, finely shredded</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp extra-virgin olive oil</strong><br /><strong>2 garlic cloves, finely sliced, plus one for rubbing</strong><br /><strong>250g morcilla, skinned</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp sherry</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp sherry vinegar</strong><br /><strong>1 handful mint leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>4 slices rustic-style bread</strong></p> \n<p>Bring a medium pot of water to a boil and simmer the broad beans until just done, about four to five minutes. Drain and leave in the colander to steam dry.</p> \n<p>Melt the butter in a large frying pan over a medium-high heat. Once sizzling, add the leek, half the oil and a generous pinch of salt (or two). Saute for three minutes, then add the garlic and cook for a few minutes more, until the leek is just softening. Crumble the morcilla or black pudding into the pan and use a wooden spoon to break it up further. Fry for about five minutes, until the pudding is caramelising on the outside and just cooked through, then stir in the beans, sherry, sherry vinegar and a splash of water. Turn down the heat and cook, stirring gently, for a couple of minutes more, so the liquid reduces to a syrupy sauce. Season to taste, and add a splash more vinegar if it needs to be a little sharper, then stir in the mint.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, toast the bread (on a char-grill if you can, so you get those lovely char lines). Rub the cut side of the spare garlic clove over the toast (the hard bread will act a bit like a grater), then drizzle with the remaining oil. Place on plates and spoon over the broad bean and black&nbsp;pudding mix. Add a final sprinkle of mint and serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>And for the rest of the week…</strong></h2> \n<p>The sauteed squid is delicious tossed into a salad as well as with the spaghetti. Allow it to cool once fried as above, and save for tossing with rocket and dressed with olive oil and more lemon juice – that makes a great bruschetta topping, by the way, if you want a laid-back but glam dish to hand round before dinner (and way less work than a&nbsp;formal starter). Blitz any leftover cooked peas with some goat’s cheese or fresh curd, lots of mint, a&nbsp;little garlic and seasoning, and use&nbsp;to fill fried wontons, quesadillas or wraps.</p> \n<p>Buy more morcilla or black&nbsp;pudding than you need for today’s dish – like chorizo, it keeps for weeks in the fridge. It’s a real winner fried and served in salads with sliced pears, shallots and baby&nbsp;gem, or with roast red peppers.&nbsp;Eat young broad beans any which way – I often serve a pile of the pods whole in the centre of the&nbsp;table, alongside a bowl of grassy extra-virgin olive oil, some good country bread and a hunk of pecorino, and leave guests to shell the beans themselves… it’s fun, not to mention gloriously easy.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Thomasina Miers is co-owner of <a href=\"http://www.wahaca.co.uk\" title=\"\">the Wahaca group of Mexican restaurants</a>.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/5/26/1432643411808/Thomasina-Miers-spaghetti-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thomasina Miers' spaghetti with squid, peas and chilli: 'Beautifully simple flavours yet full of punch.'

This week’s theme, though, has convinced me that a pot of creme fraiche is so much more than a sidekick to sickly sweets... My tastebuds have travelled from France and Greece to South America and the Middle East, resulting in hugely varied recipes, all with boast-worthy results.</p> \n<p>Mmarilena’s Greek syrup cake – spiked with aniseed – incorporates creme fraiche into the batter and is toothsome in the extreme, as are Clairetweet’s luxury scones. Serve these hot from the oven with plenty of jam and the rest of the tub of creme fraiche.</p> \n<p>Used in savoury recipes, creme fraiche lends creaminess to a dish without the rich, heaviness of cream or white sauce – see Leftoverliz’s classic flammekueche, or tarte flamb&eacute;e.</p> \n<p>Creme fraiche also lifts roasted veg to centre stage – try Marmaduke Scarlet’s sweet roasted carrots, or Fadime Tiskaya’s burnt spring-onion dip. But this week’s winning recipe – despite the list of somewhat disparate ingredients (peanut butter, fish sauce) – was transformed entirely by a generous dollop of creme fraiche. Proof indeed that this is a versatile tub your fridge can’t do without.</p> \n<h2><strong>East Asian-meets-South American prawn curry</strong></h2> \n<p>The creme fraiche makes a rich, creamy sauce and mellows the spice from the chilli. To mellow it further, remove the seeds from the chilli. The fish sauce stands in for shrimp paste and adds umami depth. This should be cooked gently throughout to avoid scalding the creme fraiche. Since the prawns are already cooked they just need to be heated through and flavoured. Ready all your ingredients before you start cooking and this will come together easily.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Sarah%20isDichohecho\"><em>Sarah isDichohecho</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/555c9725e4b034dccb767cec\"><em>GuardianWitness</em></a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a47d3846ca240faf3315db3e52935d03460f04a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433416402356/7495f8ab-d0ce-43a9-a298-dfdc29aa6ea1-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"An east-Asian-South-American prawn curry, courtesy of this week's winner, Sarah...\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cook gently and prepare well and this curry will come together in no time...</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Serves 2-3</strong><br />A dash of sesame oil<br />3 spring onions, sliced<br />2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />15g fresh coriander, stalks chopped and separated from leaves<br />1 red chilli, chopped<br />Salt and pepper<br />200g cooked prawns<br />2 tbsp desiccated coconut<br />&frac14; red pepper, sliced thinly<br />1 tbsp chunky peanut butter<br />2-3 large tomatoes, chopped<br />A handful of sugar snap peas or mange tout, sliced or left whole<br />1 tbsp Thai-style fish sauce<br />3 heaped tbsp half-fat creme fraiche<br />Juice of &frac12; a lime<br />2 portions basmati rice, cooked</p> \n<p>1 Heat the sesame oil and soften the spring onions and garlic. Then add the coriander stalks and chilli. Season a little.</p> \n<p>2 Next add the prawns, stirring so they don’t get boiled too much. Distribute the desiccated coconut evenly across the pan. It’s OK if it sticks to the prawns or toasts slightly. Add the red pepper and let it soften.</p> \n<p>3 Stir in the peanut butter, making sure it doesn’t stick and burn.

Add the creme fraiche and cheese and season. Serve with toast or crispbreads.</p> \n<h2><strong>Greek semolina cake (ravani)</strong></h2> \n<p>This is my version of a traditional syrup-soaked semolina cake, called ravani. It is supposed to be a traditional Greek recipe but truth is that this kind of cake is found in almost every cuisine in the Eastern Mediterranean. There are a number of regional variations of this cake throughout Greece. Personally, I use creme fraiche to add richness to the cake and I also scent it with mastika liqueur. It is a very moist and fragrant, almost addictive, cake that gets even better the next day. Enjoy it with an extra dollop of creme fraiche.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/mmarilena\"><em>Mmarilena</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/555c9725e4b034dccb767cec\"><em>GuardianWitness</em></a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c7819eae691b6779855215200a7ddc66614626a1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433417125546/7cf11ee8-4a34-4bca-92da-1aa110b71d2d-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Mmarilena's pic of her moreish and moist Greek semolina cake...\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mmarilena’s pic of her moreish and moist Greek semolina cake...</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mmarilena/GuardianWitness</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Serves 8-10</strong><br /><strong>For</strong> <strong>the</strong> <strong>cake</strong><br />180g semolina flour<br />100g plain flour<br />1 tsp baking powder<br />5 eggs<br />140g sugar<br />200g creme fraiche (room temperature)<br />1 shot of mastika or ouzo liqueur<br />A large handful of flaked almonds</p> \n<p> <strong>For the syrup</strong><br />200ml water<br />350g sugar<br />30g glucose syrup<br />50ml <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastika\">mastika</a> or ouzo liqueur</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 170C/325F/gas mark 3, then grease and line a 24cm cake tin. Sift the semolina, the baking powder and the flour in a bowl. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs with the sugar for about 10 minutes or until the mixture doubles in volume and gets pale and creamy.</p> \n<p>2 Whisk the creme fraiche with the liqueur and fold it into the egg mixture. Fold the dry ingredients into the egg mix very gently until the mixture is just combined together.</p> \n<p>3 Pour the batter into the tin, sprinkle with the almonds and bake for 30 minutes, or until cooked in the middle and golden.</p> \n<p>4 While the cake is cooking, make the syrup. Put the water, sugar and glucose syrup in a saucepan over a low heat, then cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until the sugar has dissolved. Increase the heat to high and boil, without stirring, for 4-5 minutes, or until the mixture thickens. Add the liqueur.</p> \n<p>5 When the cake comes out the oven, cut into diamonds across the tin. Ladle the hot syrup over the hot cake, allowing each ladle of syrup to be absorbed, before ladling again. Allow time for the syrup to be absorbed, and then serve cold or at room temperature.</p> \n<h2><strong>Flammekueche flatbread</strong></h2> \n<p>Flammekueche, or tarte flamb&eacute;e, is a dish from Alsace (hence both French and German names.) It is like a pizza, but wafer-thin and crispy, topped with creme fraiche, smoked bacon and onions. You can make it with a pizza dough, or with a flatbread dough as in this recipe.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/leftoverliz\"><em>Leftoverliz</em></a><em>, </em><em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/555c9725e4b034dccb767cec\">GuardianWitness</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"276c397ebe4ddeb8069afdcd34e6932e925131fe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433417260281/f6570a8c-27ec-40c4-8b7e-cfa9f529edb7-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"A french-German flatbread like a thin, crispy pizza, which is delicious with bacon and cheese.\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A french-German flatbread like a thin, crispy pizza, which is delicious with bacon and cheese.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LeftoverLiz/GuardianWitness</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br /><strong>For the dough</strong><br />250g plain flour<br />2 tsp salt<br />50ml vegetable oil<br />150ml warm water<br />Cornmeal, for sprinkling</p> \n<p><strong>For the topping</strong><br />2 onions, thinly sliced<br />Butter, for frying<br />Oil, for frying<br />140g smoked bacon, cut into thin strips or lardons<br />200ml creme fraiche</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 250C/475F/gas mark 9. Make the dough by combining the flour, salt and oil and adding the water bit by bit until you have a dough that is easy to handle.</p> \n<p>2 Knead for a little while on a floured board until elastic and then roll out really thinly. Sprinkle some cornmeal or extra flour on a baking tray and lay the dough on it.</p> \n<p>3 Fry the onions in some butter and oil until translucent and starting to turn golden, but not too dark. Then lightly fry the bacon strips once the onions have softened a little.</p> \n<p>4 Spread creme fraiche quite thickly over the surface of the dough, add the bacon and onions, and bake in the oven until the bacon is crispy and starting to catch and the creme fraiche is beginning to brown. Delicious with a cold glass of Alsace white wine.</p> \n<h2><strong>Luxury scones with creme fraiche</strong></h2> \n<p>I had always baked the scone recipe my mother made. But they were a bit ordinary. So I have been trialling different ingredients and quantities and I have settled on this as my new “luxury scone”’. I like to make these quite small so you that you can break them open while they are still warm.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/clairetweet\"><em>Clairetweet</em></a><em>, via </em><em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/555c9725e4b034dccb767cec\">GuardianWitness</a></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"138556249f1ee376595a272fd3bd7fe42861a2d1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433417460089/0ee72347-173f-48c7-b263-3f2d237fc705-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"ClareTweet's pic, uploaded to GuardianWitness, of her \" luxury=\"\" scones\"=\"\" –=\"\" just=\"\" baked!\"=\"\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">ClareTweet’s pic, uploaded to GuardianWitness, of her “luxury scones” – just baked!</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ClareTweet/GuardianWitness</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Makes 8-10<br /></strong>280g self-raising flour<br />1 tsp baking powder<br />A pinch of salt<br />85g butter<br />2&frac12; tbsp vanilla sugar (or add a drop of vanilla extract to the eggs)<br />1 egg yolk<br />2 tbsp creme fraiche<br />150ml milk</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.
