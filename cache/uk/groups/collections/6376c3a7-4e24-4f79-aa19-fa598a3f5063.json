This is because we have pre-ordered (as you must) the clay-baked duck at <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk\">this extraordinary new restaurant</a> from <a href=\"http://stevieparle.co.uk\">chef Stevie Parle</a>. Parle himself brings the bird, wrapped in pale clay and looking for all the world, on its nest of pine, like a giant pupa.</p> \n<p>Tap, tap with the truncheon, and the clay parts to reveal more layers, hay and fermented cabbage. The larval impression intensifies as cabbage is peeled apart, trailing strings of ducky goo. It’s all very <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/alien\">Alien</a>. But out of this vaguely disturbing carapace emerges a luminous “butterfly”: a roast duck, bronze-lacquered in honey and miso, almost too perfect-looking to be real – like one of those plastic Japanese window-display foods. It’s whisked away to return, jointed and carved into pristine chunks, with wafers of purple pickled carrot, roll of cabbage, a sweet-savoury pear (from, I think, its “broad bean and barley miso”) and “fireplace potatoes”, sliced into an armadillo shape, like hasselbacks – nutty, crisp, bewitching – roasted in Craft’s own-cultured butter in the ashes of the wood-fired ovens. The duck alone is worth the schlep to Greenwich. Hell, with its tender, rosy flesh, sticky skin, fat basted away to nothing, and the whole suffused with a subtle smokiness and sweetness, I’d almost swim there for it.</p> \n<p>Yes, it costs &pound;75, which causes a frisson. But it feeds three (we take a lot home) and could easily stretch to four. It’s hard for the rest of the menu to keep up with this barnstormer, but keep up it does: turnip, carrot and cauliflower pickled in brine and planted on strained yoghurt with fronds of fennel might seem Spartan by comparison, but has a wonderful, fresh vibrancy. Einkorn, an ancient, protein-rich wheat variety, is used to make a cakey drop scone topped with a sultry duck liver parfait, jammy damsons and tiny, frothy bouquets of elderflower. There is the finest eel I’ve tasted (and, yes, I’ve been to Japan): glossy, dark-toffee coloured, it wreathes the mouth in buttery smoke, bitter sweetness from treacle, sharpness from malt vinegar, blades of pickled leek – and sheer eelishness.</p> \n<p>Home-cured meats are remarkable: ribbons of white pork fat, a feisty London lardo; petals of pork loin, gently salty, wholly porcine; IPA-cured beef leg, like the best bresaola, but subtler; lop (a rare-breed pig) salami, its peppery richness spiked by a dab of fierce mustard. There’s a Britishness to it all, uncompromising in intent (Parle is using UK-only suppliers), but luxurious in execution.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"91cd74215f87563891f83f41c10edc69493e3cb0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434378054954/92aff1b8-244f-4009-a380-cd940bad8b9d-316x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Clay-baked duck\" width=\"316\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Craft’s clay-baked duck: ‘It’s hard for the rest of the menu to keep up with this barnstormer, but keep up it does.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I arrive early for my meal – whisking along the Jubilee line takes a lot less time than I imagine – so I wander around <a href=\"http://www.theo2.co.uk\">the O2</a>’s internal “street” of restaurants, increasingly dejected. There’s the estimable <a href=\"https://www.byronhamburgers.com\">Byron</a>, true, but there are also the execrable <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/jul/09/perfect-burger-review-nationwide\">Five Guys</a>, <a href=\"http://www.garfunkels.co.uk\">Garfunkels</a>, <a href=\"http://www.frankieandbennys.com\">Frankie &amp; Benny’s</a>. There’s a place threatening, “Try our Elvis-inspired menu”. Seriously? One joint I’d never previously heard of, <a href=\"http://jimmysrestaurants.com\">Jimmy’s</a>, offers Mexican, Italian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese and American food – I don’t need my inbuilt restaurant equivalent of gaydar to know it’ll be several levels of shite. Even the strikingly beautiful, mosaic-ed <a href=\"http://www.farshidmoussavi.com/node/28\">Farshid Moussavi campus building</a> alongside has a <a href=\"http://www.caferouge.com\">Cafe Rouge</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.chiquito.co.uk\">Chiquito</a> festering in its haunches. For Parle to open up here is the equivalent of his newly hatched butterfly landing in a bluebottle nest.</p> \n<p>There’s no doubt Craft is a curious place. During the day, it has the look of the only upscale restaurant in this newly built village. At night, though, the design (by long-time collaborator <a href=\"http://www.tomdixon.net/uk/?gclid=CLHmrPj98MUCFSLKtAodvUsA0Q\">Tom Dixon</a>) makes sense, as city lights glitter in the darkness outside the wraparound, third-floor cocktail bar. The vivid colour scheme, all turquoise, mauve, sapphire, copper, mutes into something louche and sexy. But the lightbulb moment happens when you realise that the building’s sheer scale has allowed those wood-fired ovens, in-house curing rooms, a vast kitchen for on-site butchery, a fermenting cellar, coffee roastery, plus Parle has the use of the new public park, co-designed by Dixon, Thomas Hoblyn and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alys-fowler\">the Guardian’s own Alys Fowler</a>, for an orchard, beehives and smoking huts: it’s a fertile mini empire. With our duck, we have a bowl of greens (“from our garden”), the freshest-tasting, sprightliest leaves and herbs grown within spitting distance. Like I said, extraordinary. But nothing is more extraordinary than that duck.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk\"><strong>Craft London</strong></a><strong> </strong>Peninsula Square, Greenwich Peninsula, London SE10, 020-8465 5910.

But for how long, asks Jay Rayner</p>","byline":"Jay Rayner","body":"<p><strong>1 Leicester Street, London WC2 (020 3696 6460). Meal for two, including drinks and service: &pound;120</strong></p> \n<p>How can an entire street corner lose its way? How can it simply stop being a place anyone wants to visit and become instead the subject only of deep sighs and shrugs? For decades the corner of Leicester and Lisle Streets on the southern edge of London’s Chinatown was definitely a place people frequented – until they didn’t. It was occupied by a legendary fish restaurant called Manzi’s, with gingham tablecloths and swollen plaits of bread made of plastic hanging over the bar. You went there for oysters and Dover sole, and for Italian waiters straight out of central casting. They did stewed eels with mash, and something worrying called curried halibut and a strawberry tart everyone swore by. Manzi’s was a great London restaurant when the city didn’t have enough of them.</p> \n<p>In 2007 it went dark. London no longer thought it needed Manzi’s. Perhaps it didn’t. The building was sold to Fergus Henderson and Trevor Gulliver of Clerkenwell’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2007/oct/14/foodanddrink.restaurants\">St John</a>, who took a long time converting it into a boutique hotel. It had their customary white abattoir chic, and a restaurant that grilled the inner valves and ducts of animals and did fabulous bronzed pies that scared diners from Surrey. But not enough people wanted to sleep in a room that looked like somewhere you could butcher a pig, or eat great pies and valves and ducts, however brilliantly bronzed and grilled, and the cost of delayed renovation meant they were always playing financial catch-up.</p> \n<p>It was sold to the Singapore-based hotel group behind the <a href=\"http://townhallhotel.com/home\">Town Hall Hotel</a> in Bethnal Green. They softened the whiteness of the dining room by adding gunmetal grey panelling, and kept the St John-style menu under the same chef, Tom Harris, but still no one really wanted to come, despite the food being very good. I like a grilled duct, me. So now it has been sold on again to become Leicester House with yet another restaurant, this time serving “French Vietnamese” food. And I’m afraid I’m still not convinced anyone will have much of a need to come to this London street corner. Or, if they do, it will be because they don’t know any better.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0bd559a8e2989264db6b134fcee767184ce6427\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934332997/90f2e994-2a52-4dc0-9afa-f76a26eade05-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'The latest annoying piece of menu cobblers': bone broth.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The latest annoying piece of menu cobblers’: bone broth.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Think of this review as a companion to last week’s, where I scratched my head over Alan Yau’s glossy take on the eclectic Chinatown Chinese restaurant and then concluded it provided an interesting one-stop shop. This one sits on the other edge of Chinatown, offering something nobody needs: a limp, vapid, emasculated take on the Vietnamese repertoire. Somewhere in this hotel, perhaps locked away in a safe, must lie the testicles of an entire culinary tradition. It is Vietnamese food for people who wouldn’t like real Vietnamese food, and who want to drink cloudy “natural” prosecco while not eating it. There are warning signs: the place settings of heavy-handled knives and forks, rather than chopsticks which are never offered; the lack of chilli sauces on the tables, or any sauces at all for that matter.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the very notion should have been enough to sound the alarms. Vietnamese food has been strongly influenced by French colonialism, hence the famed b&aacute;nh m&igrave;, a baguette sandwich, only using a lighter bread than found in the occupying homeland. The idea of French Vietnamese food feels tautological. Then you see the menu. They’ve put duck liver parfait in with the dry pork belly in their b&aacute;nh m&igrave;, made with a heavy loaf, to produce something dense and cloying. They’ve also added a very short cheese and charcuterie list. Including Italian ham. I’m sorry, but now you’ve lost me.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3ec6bba2872c0726d8b3f08f443f3a390789815\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934583679/a7b391f0-6013-423a-b2fc-d75d0421a757-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'Big tiger prawns under a deep leaf fall of fresh green herbs and crushed peanuts.'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Big tiger prawns under a deep leaf fall of fresh green herbs and crushed peanuts.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The problem here is not clumsiness. They do a fair job of grilling some big tiger prawns and then offer them up under a deep leaf fall of fresh green herbs and crushed peanuts. A salad of blackened squid definitely contains squid that has been blackened. Taken alone, these dishes, and others like them, are fine without being enlivening or astonishing. But taken together it becomes a dull parade. It is all one note, a whack of sugar and salt and absolutely no fire and spice. Smoked ribs are long braised, not very smoky and again taste of sugar and salt. Some of the pricing is odd. A sizable portion of the ribs is &pound;7.50. One limp, boned-out quail is &pound;16.50. The latter is advertised as coming with salt, lime and ginger, which sounds fresh and thrilling. If only. Green papaya, daikon and cashew slaw is crunchy enough if underpowered. Steamed ong choi with fried garlic is very salty. Where is the intensity, the brazenness?</p> \n<p>Naturally, being a hip new London restaurant, they serve a “bone broth”, which is the latest annoying piece of menu cobblers. It’s a roasted bone-based stock, simmered for 12 hours. Or stock, as it’s known, but you try flogging a bowl of that for big money. (Lots of chefs, who have no medical training and who gained their nutritional knowledge from scrolling through Reddit, love making health claims for bone broth. Unsurprisingly they don’t stand up to examination. For example, ingesting collagen that’s been cooked for 12 hours will not prove beneficial for bone growth, however much you close your eyes and whisper, “I wish, I wish, I wish.”) The bone broth here, with strands of long-braised pork collar and tightly bound crab wonton, is actually the best hit of the salt and sweet on the menu, but &pound;12.50 is an awful lot to pay for a bowl of stock with stuff in it.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3820a5a72308bc1969ff83598666beff60b7035\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433935008628/23ede46c-d430-4d86-ac38-e45f2f22225f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'What depresses me most is some people might think this represents Vietnamese food': salt-baked pineapple.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘What depresses me most is some people might think this represents Vietnamese food’: salt-baked pineapple.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for The Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>What depresses me most is some people might think this represents Vietnamese food; that, in being served in this square, wood-panelled room with the comfy leather chairs and the fancy wine list, it is some higher expression of the tradition. It really isn’t. Desserts of a chocolate pot, topped with nitro-gunned cream, a few passable vanilla doughnuts and some salt-baked pineapple don’t help the cause any either.</p> \n<p>When we arrived at Leicester House I was greeted by a young very friendly chap who had served me here when it was both the St John Hotel and its successor. I can see why he has been kept on. He is charming and efficient without being intrusive, and makes the steely dining room a pleasant enough place in which to pass the time. As we leave, I joke that I’ll see him when the restaurant launches its next incarnation. He sighs deeply, as if to say he probably will. This once-famous, now-forgotten Chinatown corner is, I fear, still not ready for a glorious return to the limelight.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s news bites<br /></h2> \n<p>■ A few days later, for real Vietnamese food I went to Cay Tre on Soho’s Dean Street. There was a papaya salad with fire and flash, and summer rolls full of fresh prawn and crunchy rice noodle. There was catfish in caramelised anchovy sauce, pork belly stewed in coconut milk and seared mustard greens with chilli. It’s half the price and twice the flavour (<a href=\"http://vietnamesekitchen.co.uk/\">vietnamesekitchen.co.uk</a>)</p> \n<p>■ Congratulations to Chris Honor of Chris Kitch, the little deli-caf&eacute; in London’s Muswell Hill, on the publication of his cookbook Big Flavours From a Small Kitchen written with Laura Washburn Hutton. Think big-fisted salads, robust soups and terrific sweet and savoury bakes (<a href=\"http://www.chriskitch.com/\">chriskitch.com</a>)</p> \n<p>■ Meanwhile, Phaidon has some thrilling books coming up for autumn. There’s Toast at a mere &pound;14.95. Apparently, ‘Toast features 50 seasonal recipes for artisanal toast that will appeal to home cooks of all levels.’ Better still there’s Breakfast and a Dog in which food stylist Natsuko Kuwahara captures ‘the moment she serves breakfast under the watchful eye of her dog’.

They’re honking with hilarity, phones clicking like dolphins. Who knows what’s causing the mirth – maybe the Buckfast ice-cream (notorious fortified wine, known locally as “Electric Soup”), or the burger topped with Smith’s bacon crisps, or the Irn-Bru pork. The “Mad Chef” at <a href=\"http://bloc.ru/\">Bloc</a> specialises in OTT food designed not so much to be savoured as to cause a commotion. Especially online. His Pot Noodle burger might be revolting, but it is a wholly successful piece of attention-grabbing. Love it or loathe it – and there is a startling number for whom the very idea causes a foam of fury – the marriage of food and social media isn’t going away any time soon.</p> \n<p>The internet has become increasingly food-obsessed since the early days when a slightly fetishistic subculture known as “foodies” would post pictures of <a href=\"http://www.tayyabs.co.uk/\">Tayyabs</a>’s legendary lamb chops on hilariously clunky sites such as <a href=\"http://forums.egullet.org/\">eGullet</a>. Today, it is impossible to scroll through any timeline without encountering other people’s lunches, and, worldwide, there is an increase in dishes that appear to be deliberately engineered to get you snapping before tucking in. Take the <a href=\"http://www.carmelwines.co.il/en/aboutus.aspx\">Carmel Winery</a> in Israel with its Foodography tasting menu, featuring as many flowers and twiddles as you can shake a tweezer at, and its “Limbo” crockery that incorporates a mobile-phone stand. The international chain <a href=\"http://www.chilis.com/EN/Pages/home.aspx\">Chili’s</a> has just appointed a consultancy that came up with egg wash to make its burger buns more photogenic and “shareable”; the cost – <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/instagram-food-taste-study-research/\">a cool $750,000</a>. You’re scoffing? Research suggests<a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CHILIS_PHOTOGENIC_BUNS?SITE=AP\"> that photographing your food makes it taste better</a> (it’s all to do with ritual and savouring).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e6b36a49dc96db131f97e3ef844fa7cafd7cae5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859293548/37b28b1e-82cb-448d-8f2d-096be9381abd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Meat fruit at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meat fruit at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Palmer-Watts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It has been going on for a few years now. In 2011, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/02/heston-blumenthal-christmas-canapes-meat\">Heston Blumenthal created his “meat fruit”</a>, a chicken-liver parfait coated in jelly and fashioned into a startling facsimile of a tangerine. This coincided with a massive spike in Twitter usage and, lo, the delicately dimpled orange was everywhere. In the US, Frankenstein creations such as the cronut were tweeted like the second coming. Earlier still, then-young gun David Chang’s nascent empire was fuelled by fans gibbering about his pork buns online. He played to the crowd, and suddenly everyone knew about Taiwanese-style buns. Soon diners were working as unpaid marketeers for their favourite restaurants, a paradigm fully exploited in the UK by clued-up new restaurateurs such as Russell Norman of <a href=\"http://www.polpo.co.uk/\">Polpo</a> and Scott Collins of <a href=\"http://meatliquor.com/\">MeatLiquor</a>.</p> \n<p>Now everyone’s at it. Are these chefs and restaurateurs pulling our strings? The more serious, cerebral types will deny there is any such manipulation at play. When the <a href=\"http://www.chilternfirehouse.com/\">Chiltern Firehouse</a> landed in London, a new star was born: chef Nuno Mendes’ crab doughnuts. Did he know that they were going to be as much of a draw as the chance of clocking Kate Moss? Not according to Mendes: “They were an experiment at [his previous restaurant] Viajante that only saw the light of day when we opened the Firehouse,” he says. “I just didn’t have the right space to serve them. Some ideas stay in your head for years before they find their way out.” I believe him, although I suspect he knows exactly what he’s doing at his new place, <a href=\"http://www.tabernamercado.co.uk/\">Taberna do Mercado</a>, with his twist on <em>abade de priscos</em>, a strikingly visual pudding – yellow and scarlet from its egg yolks and port caramel, given even more of a shareability factor by the addition of pork fat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f08c80f893ede6e9acc194e7ee4e408e23e4b68e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859101483/397f38d1-2c3b-444d-9363-b0b33c4bdaa2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nuno Mendes' abade de priscos, or pork fat pudding\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuno Mendes’ abade de priscos, or pork fat pudding.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most of the chefs and restaurateurs I speak to are coy about the idea that they would do anything so calculated. When I ask Jonathan Downey, the orchestrator of a sprawling street-food collective, if any of his team deliberately creates dishes in the hopes of online cult status, he laughs. “My God. I thought I was cynical, but <em>you</em> …” Most profess to be taken aback by the sudden stardom. A contender for the most-Instagrammed dish in the UK at the moment must be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/28/french-toast-the-pudding-of-2015\">Shackfuyu’s <em>kinako</em> french toast</a>; general manager Alina Sann says the sheer popularity of this simple dessert took them completely by surprise. “We have quite a small menu and kitchen, so we wanted something easy to make – but it has taken us way beyond what we ever expected,” she says. So why the fandom? “It looks quite cool, especially with the <em>matcha</em> soft-serve on the side. People started posting pictures … it started getting all the hype, and it’s an easy sell for our waiters because they know everyone will love it.”</p> \n<p>The spectacular confit potatoes at the <a href=\"http://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House</a> are another internet smash (and something <a href=\"https://instagram.com/marinagpoloughlin/\">I’m guilty of Instagramming</a> more than once). Chef Shaun Shearly also credits necessity for their genesis: “They were born on the back of really wanting to stay away from a conventional chip – mostly because of space in my little kitchen, and because people expect that fried carb.” What are the downsides of having such a labour-intensive “star” dish? “With potatoes being so variable in water due to their starch levels, they need constant attention. And I can never take them off the menu, despite them being a complete pain in the arse during service. We can only cook three portions at a time, and they take about four minutes to cook. Most tables order at least three portions at a time.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dfd439fb35da835d580ce3bedd3b289da721ba4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859160488/aece8a5b-676d-4af3-8ee9-3552ae8da1a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So it’s all a happy accident, right? Speak to the publicists, however, and a different story emerges. When I ask Hannah Norris, the PR for a number of the capital’s hottest restaurants, if she advises chefs to deliberately devise dishes to grip the internet by the throat, she says: “Yes, I’d encourage it for sure. Content is key – and having a ‘hero’ dish to shout about is often the difference between a stonking launch and a lukewarm one. If a restaurant asks me to do their PR, one of the first questions is, ‘What’s the glory dish? What’s our <a href=\"http://duckandwaffle.com/\">Duck &amp; Waffle</a>?’ If there isn’t one, I often make my excuses and scurry away.”</p> \n<p>With all the chefly coyness, it is refreshing to speak to Stevie Parle, the owner of the newly opened <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk/\">Craft</a> in Greenwich, who is pragmatic about the value of the cult dish. His clay-baked duck actively encourages sharing, not only over dinner but, with his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IZMNy3quzA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">hypnotic video of the bird’s serving ritual</a>, online too. “The duck [served in clay to be smashed at the table] was very conscious,” he says. “Most chefs have always thought about ‘signature’ dishes and generally end up hating them, but now there is an added element of them going viral too.” So they are stuck with them? Yes, says Parle: “I love the duck but it isn’t ever going to be able to come off the menu. And people get really cross if I start smashing it before they’re ready with their cameras.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IZMNy3quzA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4IZMNy3quzA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Franco Sotgiu of Solita in Manchesteralso acknowledges the internet effect. “It pains me to say, but when creating specials I’ve learned that anything with ‘big, fried, bacon or cheese’ in the title sells well. The better they look in a photo on Twitter and Facebook, the more RTs and likes they get, the better they sell.” He is rueful about the side-effects: “In Manchester, ‘dirty’ still sells well, and even though I’ve tried relentlessly to push more grill items and less calorific dishes, the stuff that looks sloppy-great in a photo can often achieve 500-plus RTs on Twitter. So it makes sense from a business point of view to lead with these.”</p> \n<p>It is as simple as bums on seats, then. Instagram snaps are the restaurant’s equivalent of an Amsterdam-style shop window. Viewers scroll through pic after pic, the squelchier, more drooling meat juices on show the better, frequently tagged – ugh – #foodporn. Petra Barran of streetfood collective Kerb says: “Anything oozing melted cheese does really well.” Neil Rankin of the Smokehouse and Bad Egg takes it even further: “Burgers, as long as they are oozy and wet, are a sure thing. Food gets people off without the guilt of objectifying the opposite sex.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2588e7ba41865c8556c05af17f0aa0695968fe57\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859493093/0bc4a537-124b-4c6b-8c4e-b6c6dcb6053b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"St John's doughnuts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St John’s doughnuts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But what’s in it for the tweeters and Instagrammers? The anonymous <a href=\"https://instagram.com/clerkenwellboyec1/\">Clerkenwell Boy</a>, a hugely followed Instagrammer whose account has contributed to the fetishisation of what is frequently dubbed *that* burger or *those* wings, says: “I think there is something fundamentally satisfying about sharing a photo of a brilliant dish with others. I’m no psychologist, but it probably also has links to ‘social proof’ – so posting photos of *that* dish is like providing (and receiving) a universal seal of approval. I guess you could liken it to the way that tourists react when they see a major landmark in a foreign city. Just like the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben, a photo of *that* signature dish means that you’ve arrived.” What does he think it is that captures the imagination so fiercely? “People suffer from massive food envy and fear of missing out. Ordering *that* dish becomes a failsafe way to ensure we don’t make the wrong choice.”</p> \n<p>Not only is there the serotonin rush from watching the likes mount up, but there is the chance of catching the celebs’ eye: a #followoftheday from Nigella or a regram by Jamie. (Nigella’s Instagram of Stevie Parle’s clay duck video has, at the time of writing, more than 2,300 likes.) It creates a circle of validation: the restaurants get the punters, the punters get the likes – behavioural economics. The problem, of course, is that social media is driven by the thrill of the new. Tweeters move on to the next big thing without a backward glance. Six months down the line, there’s a chorus of “we’ve all seen that bloody pithivier”, a mindset that compels chefs and restaurateurs to reach ever more attention-seeking heights, dreaming up the culinary equivalent of Kim Kardashian’s bottom to penetrate the noise. The internet’s appetite for the food rush is insatiable; and if you don’t post that snap of your <a href=\"http://www.crumbsanddoilies.co.uk/\">Crumbs &amp; Doilies</a> cupcake, or doughnut from <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/\">St John</a>, it might not taste as sweet.</p> \n<h2>Eight of the best cult dishes</h2> \n<h2>1. Stevie Parle’s clay-baked duck, <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk/\">Craft</a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd08b5a59ed5ae1218edd55b3c579dc514f0c6b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858033459/33c4b4c8-a8a3-4c71-bcda-193abfbabd18-460x346.jpeg\" alt=\"Clay-baked duck\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clay-baked duck.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Parle wanted a duck dish to rival the <em>canard &agrave; la presse</em> at <a href=\"http://ottos-restaurant.com/food.html\">Otto’s</a> in terms of occasion and fun. Based on an ancient Celtic cooking technique, it is glazed in honey, and wrapped in cabbage leaves and hay before being roasted in a clay wrapper, then delivered on a bed of pine twigs. It is then smashed open at the table and served with broad bean and barley miso, and salted carrots. Much videoed.</p> \n<h2>2. Shaun Searley’s confit potatoes, <a href=\"http://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a88bd2bde8a07bf8f830021740d3f40ec05bc507\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858093982/f0ceeeb9-4bfc-4b0e-8f3c-8669aa2d4864-460x459.jpeg\" alt=\"Confit potatoes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confit potatoes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Thinly sliced potatoes, baked like <em>pommes anna</em> but with dripping instead of butter, then sliced, fried and drizzled with mustard vinaigrette – as delicious as they are complex. Apparently, Shearley played about with a version featuring tunworth cheese and shaved truffle, the sort of thing that may cause one to emit a small moan. The subject of many posts captioned *those* potatoes.</p> \n<h2>3. Wild muntjac biryani, <a href=\"http://www.gymkhanalondon.com/\">Gymkhana </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5036863980e80bf78e840dbd1a39016691c4cb5c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858314804/7aa0f0d1-d790-4fd1-916d-c9cd573e7ac3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wild muntjac biryani\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild muntjac biryani.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is the all-action videos of this ravishing creation that add to its shareable appeal. It arrives with a flaky, domed dough lid, studded with <em>kalonji</em>, to be slit open at the table, releasing the bewitching aromas of spiced deer and buttery basmati rice. If only there were Smellagram too. An uncommon, upscale cult dish.</p> \n<h2>4. Blood cake, <a href=\"http://www.baolondon.com/\">Bao</a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a866d88f63f8bca70236b17883bd8ca52658cea1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858459407/06703ddd-2755-4c4f-8e40-4bc5f57f0328-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Blood cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blood cake.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another one Instagrammed by Nigella, thereby assuring its must-eat status. This is a traditional Taiwanese streetfood made from pig’s blood and glutinous rice. Instead of the usual peanut and coriander condiments – which feature in their classic bao – it is topped with a just-wobbling, soy-cured egg yolk. The Bao owners welcome their dishes’ “Instagrammability”, saying it provides immediate, important feedback. But they insist taste is paramount.</p> \n<h2>5. Bacon naan, <a href=\"http://www.dishoom.com/\">Dishoom </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b697a68b737006eb3c201cc65c07e07ee668842a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858515916/97d655a3-3ab3-472d-bd50-5c9789680c54-460x353.jpeg\" alt=\"Bacon naan.\" width=\"460\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bacon naan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This beauty more than deserves its online fame: a pillowy, gently charred bread stuffed with crisp bacon, cream cheese and tangy chilli-tomato jam. Some add an egg. (A fork piercing yolks in slow-motion is a meme: there are currently 63,307 Instagram post for #eggporn. Sigh.)</p> \n<h2>6.

Tiny lamps are placed on the table to ensure we are not dining in the dark. The result is a dim, quiet, moody space at the Darling Harbour end of the CBD.

And for the last five years, Sepia.<br /></p> \n<p>Sepia is the sort of place where you go to celebrate a successful corporate takeover, or being granted a mining lease, or being made partner of your law firm. Or maybe where you mark your 20-year wedding anniversary or the awarding of your Fulbright scholarship or the successful resolution of a long, protracted lawsuit. In other words – it’s a serious place. It is special, grave and slightly forbidding.

Some dishes, such as the exploding white chocolate egg dessert, are positively playful.</p> \n<p>But first things first: what sort of food and wine can you expect at Sepia? We had five courses for $160 and $90 for matching wines. In light of the world-class quality of the food and wine, that could be considered good value.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ba9182dc721765b9f5e36bfd3ddd322b337a623\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0ba9182dc721765b9f5e36bfd3ddd322b337a623/0_57_2448_1636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The amuse-bouche – salmon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The amuse-bouche – salmon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We started with an amuse-bouche – a small bite of salmon with a nest of salmon roe in the middle. Biting down into it, the roe exploded with a satisfying burst of flavour. Two bites and it was gone, but “it wakes up the palate and now you’re hungry”, said my now hungry companion. There’s a slight, delightful trickiness to it and the dish that followed. Was there someone in the kitchen with a syringe injecting the salmon roe into the small, perfectly spherical ball of salmon?</p> \n<p>And in the next course – a sashimi of yellowfin tuna, jam&oacute;n ib&eacute;rico cream avocado, baby radish, ponzu and pork crackling (minute sprinkles like divided snowflakes) – how the hell did the pinky-green cream end up as the filling in the tube of tuna?</p> \n<p>It’s worth marvelling at before consuming, because not only is the food beautifully presented but its construction is a work of art. </p> \n<p>And the wines were exquisitely chosen. The acidity of the 2013 Domaine Mittnacht Freres Gyotaku from Alsace cut through the fat of the cream. Our sommelier – like all the staff we dealt with – was knowledgable and slightly stiff. Which is good, and appropriate. In a place like this, you don’t want your waiters to crouch down, elbows on your table and say: “So have you dined with us before?”</p> \n<p>The next course – matched with a 2013 Jamsheed Roussanne from Beechworth –was tender and crunchy at the same time; the pine mushroom, fried potato, poached quail egg, caviar and roasted chicken powder like a delicious Sydney beachside breakfast in miniature. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e56b56b9f908c8f179f46b7d1745eeeedc52f9bf\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e56b56b9f908c8f179f46b7d1745eeeedc52f9bf/0_0_2105_2807/750.jpg\" alt=\"Pine mushroom, fried potato, poached quail egg, caviar, roasted chicken powder.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pine mushroom, fried potato, poached quail egg, caviar and roasted chicken powder.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the kitchen playing with texture – as well as flavour. The potato was crispy and looked like a bird’s nest; the quail’s egg was soft and runny, the mushrooms were the most flavoursome I’ve had. Together they were interesting and full of flavour without being overwhelming. </p> \n<p>“It’s got grip and a savoury edge, it walks a wonderful tightrope,” said my friend. “And it’s so seasonal. You can only get this sort of dish in Sydney, at this time of the year.”<br />He also liked that the plate was warmed appropriately for the temperature of the dish.</p> \n<p>In between courses we were served a milky bun with butter, and then came our favourite wine of the evening, a ros&eacute; from Georgia, the 2013 Pheasant’s Tears.</p> \n<p>“It’s a phantom!” exclaimed my friend. “It’s there and it’s not. No smell, no taste, nothing.” He sniffed this mysterious ruby wine. “Slight nose ... it just falls of the edge of a cliff.”</p> \n<p>The wine was paired with a crab dish (with dashimaki tamago, egg rice, kabosu, blood plum, hijiki and wild wood sorrel) that was the most comfort-food-y dish on the menu – all the softness and flavour of a Japanese omelette, with the sharp tartness of the blood plum cutting through the egginess.</p> \n<p>Our last savoury dish was the most dramatic looking. The Wagyu sirloin was finely sliced and layered, with the dark sculpture of reshaped mushroom placed on the meat like a work of art. It threw shadows the shape of antlers across the plate. Food that looks like this is almost (but not quite) too good to eat. Thank God for Instagram which will allow the memory of the perishable to remain in perpetuity.</p> \n<p>Save room for dessert. We got the white chocolate egg which, when cracked, spills treats like a pi&ntilde;ata, popping candy the flavour of finger lime and the sharp acidity of sherbet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a32e5771cb4a6fa20293943b9199dc24dbef4e2e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a32e5771cb4a6fa20293943b9199dc24dbef4e2e/0_0_2232_2992/746.jpg\" alt=\"The autumn chocolate forest dessert.\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The autumn chocolate forest dessert.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It’s a classic Spanish technique,” said my friend. “Very moulded shell, very molecular.”</p> \n<p>But not too molecular. This is still food with a lot of heart.</p> \n<p>We also shared an “autumn chocolate forest” which felt like eating a mash-up of Willy Wonka and Walt Whitman. It was nature and a forest floor as reimagined and made edible with soft chocolate, hazelnut and almond, lavender and honey cream blackberry sorbet, blueberry and rosewater jellies, green tea, <strong>l</strong>iquorice, chocolate twigs and bronze fennel.</p> \n<p>Oh, maybe you don’t need to wait until your planning permit comes through from council to build a 30-storey residential tower or you wind up giving your evidence at Icac. Maybe you should just go there because the food is so good and glorious.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/58a83c03d8c88efc64d4a211b5900a068a646db0/0_0_3045_1827/3045.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1827,"width":3045,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Brigid Delaney for the Guardian","altText":"King crab, dashimaki tamago, egg rice, kabosu, blood plum, hijiki and wild wood sorrel, as served at Sepia in Sydney.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0ba9182dc721765b9f5e36bfd3ddd322b337a623/0_57_2448_1636/2448.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1636,"width":2448,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The amuse-bouche – salmon.

But the girls, who spend half their time in Paris where Darroze oversees her other restaurant, got stuck on a delayed Eurostar.</p> \n<p>Charlotte was convinced that the prize would be a bottle of champagne (the award was sponsored by Veuve Clicquot), so Darroze had to take a photo of the trophy on her phone and send it to her to prove otherwise.</p> \n<p>“They should have been there,” Darroze says now, back in professional mode and talking over the phone from her Paris restaurant with the sound of clattering dishes in the background. “I regret it. For me, it was really important and they wanted to see it. I think they realised it was something special.”</p> \n<p>At 48, Darroze is that rare thing: a mother and a female chef operating at the top of her game in an industry still overwhelmingly dominated by men. On the same evening that she won her prestigious award, the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, as compiled by trade publication <em>Restaurant</em> magazine from an academy of more than 1,000 members, was revealed. Of that list, fewer than 4% of the kitchens were run by women.</p> \n<p>“The fact is we’re a minority, I know that,” says Darroze phlegmatically. A diminutive, forthright woman with wavy blond hair and a ready smile, she could be easily underestimated. This would be a mistake. She was born and raised in south-west France, where her parents ran a restaurant, and she was taught to cook by her grandmothers. Her first experience of a professional kitchen was at the age of 23 when, after a business degree at university, she got a job at Alain Ducasse’s Louis XV restaurant in Monaco. At the time, Darroze was the only woman in the brigade. For several months, she was authorised only to wash the lettuce. She did so without complaint, asking questions and taking notes on what was going on around her whenever she could.</p> \n<p>Three years later, she returned to run her family restaurant. By 1999, she was opening her own place in Paris, winning her first Michelin star in 2001 and gaining a slew of high-profile admirers, including the former French president Jacques Chirac and the actress Salma Hayek.</p> \n<p>Despite her professional success, Darroze considers motherhood the most important role in her life. She always wanted to have children but never met “the right man” and so, at the age of 40, decided to take matters into her own hands and adopt a baby girl from Vietnam (she returned, two years later, for her younger daughter).</p> \n<p>“Before 40, I don’t think it would have been possible for a few reasons,” she says. “First, I didn’t have in place a team strong enough to support me. I had to trust my team and be able to delegate because I wanted to be a mother who could spend time with my children … Second, because I often start work at 8.30 and come back at 11.30 or midnight, sometimes only with one hour of pause, and normally I work at least five days a week – of course I need two nannies. So on the financial side, there is a lot, and before 40 I didn’t have enough money.”</p> \n<p>She says it was beyond her control whether she adopted a boy or a girl, but “I admit, I was really happy it was like that”.</p> \n<p>Are women put off a career as a chef because they cannot see a way of juggling work and children? “Yes, it’s happened a lot of times in my kitchen. [I’ve seen] so many young women in their late 20s and early 30s and I was sure they could be the next H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Darroze or Anne-Sophie Pic [Pic has won three Michelin stars for her restaurant in south-east France] and unfortunately they say, ‘No, I want to be a wife and have a baby.’ Unfortunately they couldn’t do both at this age. When you want to be a chef at this level, it’s tricky.”</p> \n<p>Darroze is clear-sighted about the fact there is very little to be done about this because restaurant hours are always going to be long and arduous. The only thing that can change is, she says, “a woman’s mindset and that’s really difficult because when you’re a mother, of course you want to spend time with your baby. That’s humanity. I think this problem will be around for ever. It’s a big conflict in the head. I used to say if I was in love with a man who wanted to have a baby and get married to me at 32, I’m not sure I’d be here.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"841452270060ed11d5d0d213377b06948c7e63f9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/6/1433600214062/171ea289-cef3-44bb-abbf-df56d83e0ed6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Darroze trained with Alain Ducasse at his Louis XV restaurant in Monaco; for months, she was only allowed to wash the lettuce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darroze trained with Alain Ducasse at his Louis XV restaurant in Monaco; for months, she was only allowed to wash the lettuce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Hache/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s rare, I suggest, to hear a successful woman speak so openly about her desire to get married and settle down. “I am honest,” she says, and you can almost sense her shrugging her shoulders on the other end of the phone line.</p> \n<p>She is often asked what advice she would give wannabe female chefs and her response is always the same: “I say: ‘OK, be a woman. Never try to be a guy and you will be respected.’”</p> \n<p>Darroze insists she has never experienced sexism in her career, although she admits that some of her contemporaries have. But, as a rule, she is not much given to moaning. Her attitude has always been simply to get on with things and work hard. Ducasse once told her that, if she wanted to be a success, she should “notice everything. Don’t forget anything.”</p> \n<p>It is advice that has served her well. Darroze says she felt “big emotion” on receiving the award for the world’s best female chef. But isn’t it patronising to have a special prize just for women?</p> \n<p>“No. Like every minority, we have some special awards,” she replies. “On the contrary, I take that as an opportunity to speak about us [female chefs]. I take it as a good thing, as motivation to other women.”</p> \n<p>In her acceptance speech, Darroze made reference to the fact that, for the first time since her Paris restaurant opened in 1999, women now outnumber men in the kitchen. It was “not deliberate”, she says, but rather a function of the fact that there are far more female students at culinary school in France than male. As a result, she gets more women than men applying for jobs. “It’s not a personal choice – just a matter of fact and circumstance. It reflects what could happen in the future. It will be challenging because we [men and women] don’t have the same sensibility or reaction when it comes to cooking.”</p> \n<p>In what way?</p> \n<p>“Women are very instinctive, they listen to their emotions. The guys want to put something [on the plate] to show something. They think, at the beginning, of a technique they want to show, and then follow the story. We [women] think about emotion first and then put the technique on that after.</p> \n<p>“The two ways are very respectable and very different. There are some exceptions, of course. I know some male chefs who are very feminine and some female chefs who are very male.”</p> \n<p>But, generally speaking, does she think she would be able to tell whether a dish was cooked by a woman or a man in a blind tasting?</p> \n<p>“I think so,” she replies.</p> \n<p>I ask if she sees the same emotional attachment to food in her daughters, and she laughs. Both her children have a taste for spice and Charlotte was eating sushi with wasabi at the age of one.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know if it’s in their blood or DNA,” she says. “But they also like the things all kids love – the bolognese pasta, the chicken nuggets.” Darroze stops, then adds hurriedly: “Home-made ones, for sure.”</p> \n<p>Well, of course. When your mother is the world’s best female chef, it would be foolish not to make the most of it.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/5/1433527498181/H-l-ne-Darroze-in-her-Par-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hélène Darroze in her Paris restaurant, where women now outnumber men in the kitchen.

But you can have both a chicken and an egg sandwich”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bf728b0e79c69a26d3935f956ef7ce26f4366057\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433353872797/11b3efe2-a0b5-4653-8341-b3c03e4f559b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Joe Kaye and his staff serving customers at lunchtime.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joe Kaye and his staff serving customers at lunchtime.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aisha Gani for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kaye said his team of six staff were learning more about the consumer’s lunch of choice each day. “The pesto, mozzarella and tomato baguette is flying out; we can’t even keep up.”</p> \n<p>As the shelves emptied, Kaye said: “Today we increased our production, but obviously not enough.

Reyners and her two colleagues in Paris-based “collective” Occupy 50 Best have put le chat among the grilled pigeons with an attack on this week’s annual list of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/02/worlds-50-best-restaurants-list-spanish-eatery-reclaims-crown\" title=\"\">World’s 50 Best Restaurants</a>. The collective’s <a href=\" http://occupy50best.com\" title=\"\">website</a>, launched less than a month ago, has already attracted 403 signatories, including many leading chefs, to an online petition calling on the food industry to “stop financing and supporting 50 Best if it doesn’t change its methods”.</p> \n<p>The name “Occupy 50 Best” would suggest the collective’s driving force is economic, but their real concern is transparency. “This is a ranking based on nothing,” says Reyners, who works in PR but emphasises she has no food clients. “We want proper methods of selection.” The 50 best restaurants are chosen by a&nbsp;panel of 1,000 chefs, food writers and gastronomes, but Reyners says the voting process is riven with “conflicts of interest” and “cronyism” – “fishy” is the word she inevitably uses to sum it up.</p> \n<p>She also criticises the western European bias, and what she sees as a celebration of (almost invariably) male celebrity chefs. “I dislike cool cuisine and the ‘storyfication’ of chefs,” she says. “There is a need for more authenticity in cooking. One of my colleagues believes in eating naturally, and is annoyed at the favouritism shown to avant-garde and molecular food.”</p> \n<p>Why adopt the Occupy name? “It is similar to other Occupy movements in that it’s a grassroots movement without specific leaders,” she explains. Is occupation an option? She laughs. “It’s a good question. I don’t know where the movement will go. It doesn’t depend on me or on the people who started it. Hopefully other people will join, and if there are some actions taken, cool.”</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theworlds50best.com\" title=\"\">World’s 50 Best Restaurants</a> was started in 2002 by UK-based magazine Restaurant, but has now been hived off as a&nbsp;separate brand and from next year will decamp to New York. Group editor William Drew dismisses the criticism. “It’s a&nbsp;very small, if vocal, minority,” he says. “Our voting process is clear – 1,000 independent experts across the globe create the list and none of our sponsors or any of the organisers can influence it. The basis on which [Occupy’s] arguments are built is flawed. We are a positive force and celebrate gastronomy around the world.”</p> \n<p>Reyners says Occupy has received lawyers’ letters from 50 Best Restaurants, which she alleges wants to close their website down. Drew denies this, and says the letters relate only to a logo 50 Best believes is too similar to its own. Let’s hope this argument is not about to move from the dining room to the courts.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433261550812/El-Celler-de-Can-Roca-in--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"El Celler de Can Roca, in Girona, Spain, which was chosen as No 1 on the 50 Best Restaurants list.
