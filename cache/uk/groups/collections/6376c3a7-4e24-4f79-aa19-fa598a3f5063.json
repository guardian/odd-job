But do they have to be so complicated? The Guardian’s restaurant critic considers five modern masterpieces, from the Ledbury and Sat Bains, to Hedone and the Sportsman</p>","byline":"Marina O'Loughlin","body":"<p>It was <a href=\"http://noma.dk\">Noma</a> that started it. When Copenhagen’s two Michelin star restaurant first launched its now legendary signature dish – vintage carrots with camomile – in the Noughties, a generation of chefs gasped in awe and reached for their tweezers. Suddenly, vegetables everywhere were to be lightly pickled and teased into decorative little tubes of myriad colours, tottering down a specially designed plate in a wave of exquisiteness.</p> \n<p>But they were still just vegetables, right? Did the intricate and painstaking presentation make them taste any better? Apparently so: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2014/jun/20/food-presented-artistically-taste-salad-kandinsky\">a research team at Oxford University found last year</a> that a salad plated up to resemble a Kandinsky painting was judged by human guinea pigs to be more delicious than exactly the same ingredients delivered any old how. Beauty, as ever, matters.</p> \n<p>If almost every high-end restaurant in the world is to be believed, how their dishes look is right up there with flavours and ingredients. Gone are the 1990s, when food came in vertiginous towers that required servers to have the balancing skills of a circus act. Today, a dish’s components must appear to have been insouciantly strewn by Tinker Bell in a bewitching melee of dots and splodges and tiny, edible flowers.</p> \n<p>It’s no coincidence that the practitioners of high culinary art tend to be fans of vegetables (and foraged produce from fields and hedgerows). A vast chunk of charred meat might get the juices going, but it’s unlikely to win any beauty contests. So in Paris, Alain Passard “strangles” charred baby onions with a little tangle of twine, or twists leaves of mandolined courgettes into the shape of blowsy roses and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/arpegelive\">plays with colour like an artist</a>: blue potatoes and purple carrots. One of the most visually striking cookery books of recent times is <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/alexis-gauthier-vegetronic.html\">Vegetronic, by Alexis Gauthier</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.gauthiersoho.co.uk/vegetronic.php\">acid-drenched colours frame dishes of painterly loveliness</a>. And <a href=\"http://www.theethicurean.com/\">the Ethicurean</a> in Bristol, whose ingredients frequently come from its ancient walled garden, will <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=576468845764361\">tile a plate with almost translucent slices of different-coloured beetroots</a> until it looks “like a stained-glass window”.</p> \n<p>Diana Henry is the author of another book rammed with pupil-dilating, photogenic food: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/apr/05/change-of-appetite-diana-henry-review-cookworm\">Change Of Appetite</a> (I can’t stop perving over her perfect, limpid <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/pin/469852173600313212/\">poached white peach with rose jelly</a>). I ask her why the appearance of what she eats is important. She is adamant: “I honestly think that if a plate of food looks good, it can taste better.” Eating isn’t simply about taste. Cliches are cliches for a reason, hence “you eat with your eyes”.</p> \n<p>Anyone who’s ever wandered in a mesmerised trance around Tokyo’s dazzling depachikas – the football pitch-sized food halls underneath department stores – can’t fail to realise how important the visuals of food are to the Japanese, from jewel box-like bento to a single, perfect melon wrapped in tissue paper and presented in a gilded box. The Japanese fetish for beauty in food – which covers everything from crockery to glassware to the correct use of negative space – even has a name: <em>moritsuke</em>. Food slants like a cedar tree (<em>sugimori</em>) or is high like a mountain (<em>takamori</em>). Their <em>kaiseki-ryori</em> (haute cuisine raised to an art form) is about presentation every bit as much as the unimpeachable quality of the ingredients: nothing is ever left to chance. And culinarily, where Japan leads, the world follows.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If a plate of food looks good, it can taste better</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Diana Henry</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>I wonder what an artist might make of it. Apart from musing on something that occurs to a lot of us when presented with the over-elaborate dish (“Someone’s been fingering that for quite a while”), <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2014/oct/04/grayson-perry-dress-tranny-art-who-are-you-tv\">Grayson Perry</a> has a typically perceptive take: “Square plates – especially rough-hewn glass ones – seem to be an unofficial warning that the food is likely to be all show and no taste. I’m also averse to smears on the porcelain.” He makes me howl with laughter at a current gastropub trope: “I went to one place where the chips were served in a little galvanised pail, but went off the idea when I discovered their urinals were made from larger galvanised pails.” This is an unfortunate side-effect of the restaurateur failing to think his <em>moritsuke</em> through.</p> \n<p>I can only nod in enthusiastic agreement when Henry says, “I have a belief that the small things in life are very important. If we don’t get pleasure from the small things, the rather ordinary things, then we’re stuffed. Caring about making your food look lovely is part of that. Cumulatively, it makes you happier, however mad that sounds.” An independent observer of the Oxford experiment came to the conclusion that, yes, expectations were raised by the artistry on the plates and that, crucially, this meant people were prepared to pay more for beautiful food. They seemed a little perplexed by the discovery. How daft: of course we prize beauty. I just wouldn’t try this at home.</p> \n<h2>Flame-grilled mackerel with avocado, Celtic mustard and shiso: the Ledbury, London W11 </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bebd1b533c5cee60e4b0a3735f8b571f800bd627\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435826840320/b1d499bd-7cd1-4f54-9d04-6c4f97fddc3c-420x420.png\" alt=\"Flame-grilled mackerel with avocado, Celtic mustard and shiso: the Ledbury, London W11.\" width=\"420\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flame-grilled mackerel with avocado, Celtic mustard and shiso at the Ledbury, London W11: ‘Today, a dish’s components must appear to have been insouciantly strewn by Tinker Bell in a bewitching melee of dots and splodges and tiny, edible flowers.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Franke for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<ol> \n <li>The mackerel is pan-roasted until its flesh is oily and tender; its skin is then flamed over stone until it’s a crackly mackintosh of just-charred crispness.</li> \n <li>Pillows of cucumber agar-agar (a jellying agent) with a filling of mackerel tartare, plus the sting of shiso and the balm of avocado.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: &pound;50-&pound;100<br /></h2> \n<p><br />I have always associated the village of Saltwood near Hythe in Kent with a certain kind of agreeable louchness. This is because it is home to Saltwood Castle, inhabited by the late Alan Clark MP until his death in 1999, when he insisted on being buried in its grounds. Politically, Clark was to the right of Genghis Khan, and could say things that would make your bottom jaw fall so slack it seemed to have become dislocated from the rest of your skull. Referring to Africa as “bongo-bongo land” sticks in the memory. Racism aside, he did rather add to the gaiety of nations. In 1992 he retired as an MP and published his diaries, but missed the Commons so much he stood again for election in 1997.</p> \n<p>As a candidate he could no longer write his diaries. Instead, throughout the election, <a href=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435228006702/JayRayner-23-March-1997-001.jpg\">I wrote them for him</a> for this newspaper, which meant I pursued him around Kensington and Chelsea for a month. It was an eventful campaign. Halfway through, a retired judge turned up from South Africa looking to “horse whip” Clark because it transpired he’d shagged both his wife and his daughter. Clark’s birthday fell during the campaign so the <em>Observer</em> gave him a present – an academic treatise on the objectification of breasts, because we knew he appreciated those (breasts, not academic treatises.) The cover, featuring a dozen photographs of its subject, was the only racy thing about it. He passed the package to his long-suffering wife Jane to open. Apparently she was not amused.</p> \n<p>I like to think Clark would have approved of <a href=\"http://www.saltwoodrestaurant.co.uk/\">Saltwood on the Green</a>, the restaurant that not long ago opened close to the castle. As both a small and big C conservative, he might have mourned the fact that it occupies the site that was once the village general store. Then again, as the only minister ever to have been accused of being sloshed while at the dispatch box, I suspect he might have seen the benefits of being able to drink there in a way he never could when it was the local shop. There’s the modestly priced wine list, the changing roster of cocktails at &pound;7 a pop and, best of all, the local ciders by Jake’s Orchard, flavoured with nettles or strawberries which, on a muggy summer’s day, are just the thing, in a glass so heavy with ice it’s practically frosted. </p> \n<p>The last reminder of the shop is the magnificent piece of wooden shelving and drawers, once used by the store for everything from flour to spices to balls of string, which fills a whole wall. Otherwise it’s a pleasing whitewashed, airy space. Viewed through the prism of its lunchtime menu, it ticks all the boxes marked useful: there’s scrambled eggs and fishcakes, soup of the day and cheesecake. It’s where laydees come to natter. It’s when you start looking at the evening menu that you sense a greater ambition at work. The head chef is American <a href=\"http://www.saltwoodrestaurant.co.uk/team.html\">Jeff Kipp</a>, who worked at Charlie Trotter’s in Chicago before coming to London to work with Gordon Ramsay and, later, at the estimable <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/02/duck-and-waffle-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Duck and Waffle</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e7d7a4b3fdb57142e415ceacce9e6d014386f7f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435678905597/c8480254-a553-4402-ab71-10d26c0cacb5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A triangle of warm cornbread smothered at one end with sticky tomato jam and  a curl of soft goat’s cheese\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The clearest sign of head chef Jeff Kipp’s American roots are in the nibbles: warm cornbread with sweet, sticky tomato jam and goat’s cheese,’ says Jay. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The clearest sign of his American roots are in the nibbles: a delicious warm cornbread with a sweet, sticky tomato jam and a curl of soft goat’s cheese; an absurdly moreish soft pretzel, with a dish of liquid Welsh rarebit topping for dredging through, and dredging through again. Elsewhere it’s clear that Kipp is most energised by the ambitious and lightly tweezered. On the one hand, a smoked fishcake is a puck of far more potato than fish, as though he’s thinking about the lunchtime bottom line rather than the end product. It feels like something he knows he has to have there and, at &pound;7, bulking up with potato is the only way to make it work.</p> \n<p>By contrast &pound;9 for three good-sized scallops feels like value. They are perfectly seared and come draped with thin slices of lardo, the cured back fat of the pig, melting to translucence so you can see the sear marks beneath. There are curls of crackling to up the pig quotient, which can never be a bad thing, and thin batons of Granny Smith apple to give all that fat and caramelisation a bit of life.</p> \n<p>From the list marked “big plates”, a title which has a whiff of “Alan Partridge at the breakfast buffet” about it, a chicken dish is quite the piece of work. Yes it’s &pound;18, but boy do you get a lot for your money. There are thumping pieces of skinless breast from a bird that could clearly have taken you down with one punch. More impressive than the size is the fact that it tastes so deeply of chicken and is soft without feeling like cotton wool. There are small planks of smoked mushroom, bronzed cylinders of potato, and then a load more chicken that has been braised, shredded, spun through with fresh herbs and reformed into what fancy restaurants like to call a “tian” before being topped with crumbs made from crisp chicken skin. Try saying all that without taking a breath. Bring a friend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8c95affc95e240f37038187cf7ff3825b5c0ebf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435678742577/7f3c8df7-69b7-408e-92bf-f6d0782a66e6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Two slices of lamb loin next to a raviolo made with lamb's liver and crisped sweetbreads\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The lamb loin accompanied by a raviolo made with lamb’s liver and crisped sweetbreads.

They look as if they have been plated for Instagram rather than with the diner in mind. A rectangle of set pollen cream is merely a lightly aromatic mousse, though the accompanying nuggets of cinder toffee lift the dish. The piece of honeycomb reads nicely, however, but is a hit of sweet too far. A strawberry cheesecake is dependent on a disc of gel which is a little too much sweet and not enough fruit.</p> \n<p>To be fair I think these criticisms are judging Saltwood on the Green by its own standards. For all its laidback chic, this is a serious kitchen keen to punch above its weight. Often it succeeds. Certainly Alan Clark would have been very happy here. Whether they would have been happy to have him is another matter entirely.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s news bites</h2> \n<p>■ For another smart bistro punching above its weight, try Digby Chick in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis. At lunchtime it can do you paninis and fishcakes, because it must to survive. But come the evening it’s beef fillet with local scallops, or pistachio and sesame-crusted monkfish (<a href=\"http://digbychick.co.uk\">digbychick.co.uk</a>).</p> \n<p>■ One of the most beautiful dining rooms in London may get a new operator after the Criterion Restaurant on Piccadilly Circus went into administration following a 60% rent rise which, operators said, makes the business unviable in its current location. The extraordinary gold-tiled vault of the Criterion was run by Charles Forte for many years, but more recently by a Georgian entrepreneur. In my 2010 review I declared it my worst meal of the year, even though it was only January. Fingers crossed someone with taste and skill gets control (<a href=\"http://criterionrestaurant.com\">criterionrestaurant.com</a>).</p> \n<p>■ If you enjoyed billiards in the cellar at the Lime Wood Hotel in Hampshire, bad luck.

For instance, did you know that the Bee Gees have sold more than 200m records? That nearly 10 million people watched <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jan/02/tv-ratings-mrs-browns-boys-dethrones-queen\">the Mrs Brown’s Boys Christmas special</a>? Or that <a href=\"https://www.npdgroup.co.uk/wps/portal/npd/uk/news/press-releases/pubs-continue-to-build-on-food-success/\">less than one-in-10 visits to the pub</a> are now solely for the purpose of having a drink?</p> \n<p>“Sorry, come again?” you may ask of that last factoid, and you would be right to question it. Despite <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Trends-Reports/Dining-trends-Fewer-than-one-in-10-pub-visits-now-solely-drink-occasions\">the headlines that greeted this latest research</a> from market analysts NPD, its central thrust – that British pubs are now primarily places to eat rather than drink – is not quite<em> </em>as dramatic as it first appears. NPD reported that 92 out of every 100 pub visits now involve the consumption of food. But when I asked NPD to clarify this, it transpires that it counts crisps and nuts. “If the panellist considers a pint and crisps as their dinner, they can declare them as such,” said a spokesperson.</p> \n<p>That is a less resounding death knell for the quick pint than was <a href=\"https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/358129/pub-food-on-the-up-as-operators-diversify\">reported at the time</a>, but it does not soften NPD’s wider message. For those who bemoan the march of the gastropub and the way that many pubs now marginalise drinkers, this report makes grim reading. There are now 100m breakfasts sold in pubs annually, up 128% since 2008. The number of servings of alcohol in pubs has dropped by more than a quarter over the same period, while consumption of tea and coffee has risen by more than 11%. It appears to confirm what analysts and the huge pub companies have been saying for years: that the pint and the traditional boozer is in decline and, to survive, your local must become a family-friendly, food-led pub.</p> \n<p>You can see that happening all around you. Twenty-nine pubs shut each week, and those that survive are, increasingly, places to dine not drink. They are effectively restaurants in former pub spaces. I have nothing against that per se. However, no one could argue that the character of a pub is not hugely altered (that something special is lost, even), in that shift of focus from booze to food. Moreover, while this broad generational change is irrefutable, the propaganda around food-led pubs as the only viable business model has shut out discussion of potential alternatives. There are, although you might not know it, purist drinking dens bucking this rush to food.</p> \n<p>The last few years has seen a surge in pubs where you might get a bowl of wasabi peas (the most illogical pub snack ever) or, at most, a cheese barm, but whose offer is very much based around fantastic drinks, not food. The craft beer movement has been a game-changer in that respect, with – to name but a few – Manchester’s Port Street Beer House, Cask Tavern and Smithfield Tavern; Conwy’s Albion; the Black Dove in Brighton; the Wellington and Craven Arms in Birmingham; or the York, Euston and Harrogate Taps all thriving while doing at most the bare minimum of food. </p> \n<p>In some ways, the fast-growing <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2014/09/community-fixers-mighty-rise-micropub\">micropub movement</a> (small, no-frills pubs) is an implicit kick-back against the rise of shiny, barnlike family food pubs. In Manchester, there has been a remarkable recent growth in suburban bars that exclusively specialise in great beer. Many of these – Heaton Hops in Stockport, <a href=\"http://prairie-schooner-taphouse.co.uk/\">the Prairie Schooner in Urmston</a>, BarBeerian in Whitefield – double-up as bottle shops, too, a formula replicated at, for instance, Cardiff’s Gravity Station or Tall Boys in Leeds. The message? Stock high-quality, unusual drinks and that, in itself, can turn a pub into a destination. </p> \n<p>That specialism and sense of occasion is something cocktail bars have exploited for years, without feeling the need to serve food. At the same time, a new wave of informal London wine bars, such as Vindinista and <a href=\"http://www.timeout.com/london/bars-pubs/sager-wilde\">Sager + Wilde</a>, while serving food, don’t trouble themselves much beyond short menus comprising small plates, sandwiches, cheeses and charcuterie. Fundamentally, these are places to drink exciting wine. The food is almost incidental.</p> \n<p>I love restaurants, but they have a completely different dynamic to pubs and bars. Pubs are democratic, communal, potentially raucous adult spaces in a way that restaurants (almost) never are. And that is something precious. Let us raise a glass, therefore, to those landlords fighting the good fight for the pure appreciation of fine alcohol, the ennobling effects of a boozy atmosphere and a world where you can walk into a pub and not find all the tables reserved for dinner.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435080905098/756df9f1-89f9-4e6c-b445-a34051ffeb78-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Oli Scarff/Getty Images","altText":"Food for thought ... can pubs get by without going gastro?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T10:41:15Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T10:44:46Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":697,"contributors":[{"name":"Tony Naylor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tonynaylor"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Pubs","Food & drink","Restaurants","Life and style","Alcohol","Society","Beer","Wine"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/pubs","webTitle":"Pubs"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/restaurants","webTitle":"Restaurants"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"society/alcohol","webTitle":"Alcohol"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/beer","webTitle":"Beer"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tony Naylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/tonynaylor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/must-pubs-serve-food-to-survive","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3mq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/must-pubs-serve-food-to-survive","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/must-pubs-serve-food-to-survive"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435080905098/756df9f1-89f9-4e6c-b445-a34051ffeb78-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Food for thought ... can pubs get by without going gastro?

Some friends and I wanted to recapture something of our childhoods, so took a trip to one of the only three remaining Sizzler restaurants in Sydney. In the new millenium, Sizzler restaurants had become outcasts, scattered out far away from Sydney’s CBD. </p> \n<p>For kids of the 90s, there are certain Sydney landmarks which held special meaning. For me, they were Sizzler, Wonderland, Old Sydney Town and, to a lesser extent, Sega World. Of those four, only Sizzler remained open, so it become the destination for our bittersweet journey. The nearest Sizzler to us was in Carramar, a suburb 30km from the city, which will now always be associated with my own endless salad bar version of the Last Supper.</p> \n<p>The door to the restaurant declared: “We request our guests maintain a neat, casual standard of dress. (Footwear MUST be worn)”. </p> \n<p>The words “all-you-can-eat” and “dress code” don’t always go hand in hand, but Sizzler was the exception. </p> \n<p>We surveyed the menu but, in truth, we were only there for the complimentary cheese toast. I don’t care to know what caused Sizzler’s demise but I think you have to wonder about the financial viability of a business whose flagship meal item – cheese toast – was free.</p> \n<p>You really can’t overstate the brilliance of <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/heres-the-sizzler-cheese-bread-recipe/story-fnkgdftz-1227415724258\">Sizzler’s cheese toast</a>. If Sizzler’s owners had any sense, they’d rebrand as a chain of restaurants called Just Cheese Toast. Sizzler’s version – crunchy on the top but soft on the bottom – is like butter chicken at an Indian restaurant: it’s really all we were there for.</p> \n<p>But don’t try to tempt me with the salad bar. Although it was described in advertising as “endless”, for me it was beginningless.

They’re honking with hilarity, phones clicking like dolphins. Who knows what’s causing the mirth – maybe the Buckfast ice-cream (notorious fortified wine, known locally as “Electric Soup”), or the burger topped with Smith’s bacon crisps, or the Irn-Bru pork. The “Mad Chef” at <a href=\"http://bloc.ru/\">Bloc</a> specialises in OTT food designed not so much to be savoured as to cause a commotion. Especially online. His Pot Noodle burger might be revolting, but it is a wholly successful piece of attention-grabbing. Love it or loathe it – and there is a startling number for whom the very idea causes a foam of fury – the marriage of food and social media isn’t going away any time soon.</p> \n<p>The internet has become increasingly food-obsessed since the early days when a slightly fetishistic subculture known as “foodies” would post pictures of <a href=\"http://www.tayyabs.co.uk/\">Tayyabs</a>’s legendary lamb chops on hilariously clunky sites such as <a href=\"http://forums.egullet.org/\">eGullet</a>. Today, it is impossible to scroll through any timeline without encountering other people’s lunches, and, worldwide, there is an increase in dishes that appear to be deliberately engineered to get you snapping before tucking in. Take the <a href=\"http://www.carmelwines.co.il/en/aboutus.aspx\">Carmel Winery</a> in Israel with its Foodography tasting menu, featuring as many flowers and twiddles as you can shake a tweezer at, and its “Limbo” crockery that incorporates a mobile-phone stand. The international chain <a href=\"http://www.chilis.com/EN/Pages/home.aspx\">Chili’s</a> has just appointed a consultancy that came up with egg wash to make its burger buns more photogenic and “shareable”; the cost – <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/instagram-food-taste-study-research/\">a cool $750,000</a>. You’re scoffing? Research suggests<a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CHILIS_PHOTOGENIC_BUNS?SITE=AP\"> that photographing your food makes it taste better</a> (it’s all to do with ritual and savouring).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e6b36a49dc96db131f97e3ef844fa7cafd7cae5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859293548/37b28b1e-82cb-448d-8f2d-096be9381abd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Meat fruit at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meat fruit at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Palmer-Watts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It has been going on for a few years now. In 2011, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/02/heston-blumenthal-christmas-canapes-meat\">Heston Blumenthal created his “meat fruit”</a>, a chicken-liver parfait coated in jelly and fashioned into a startling facsimile of a tangerine. This coincided with a massive spike in Twitter usage and, lo, the delicately dimpled orange was everywhere. In the US, Frankenstein creations such as the cronut were tweeted like the second coming. Earlier still, then-young gun David Chang’s nascent empire was fuelled by fans gibbering about his pork buns online. He played to the crowd, and suddenly everyone knew about Taiwanese-style buns. Soon diners were working as unpaid marketeers for their favourite restaurants, a paradigm fully exploited in the UK by clued-up new restaurateurs such as Russell Norman of <a href=\"http://www.polpo.co.uk/\">Polpo</a> and Scott Collins of <a href=\"http://meatliquor.com/\">MeatLiquor</a>.</p> \n<p>Now everyone’s at it. Are these chefs and restaurateurs pulling our strings? The more serious, cerebral types will deny there is any such manipulation at play. When the <a href=\"http://www.chilternfirehouse.com/\">Chiltern Firehouse</a> landed in London, a new star was born: chef Nuno Mendes’ crab doughnuts. Did he know that they were going to be as much of a draw as the chance of clocking Kate Moss? Not according to Mendes: “They were an experiment at [his previous restaurant] Viajante that only saw the light of day when we opened the Firehouse,” he says. “I just didn’t have the right space to serve them. Some ideas stay in your head for years before they find their way out.” I believe him, although I suspect he knows exactly what he’s doing at his new place, <a href=\"http://www.tabernamercado.co.uk/\">Taberna do Mercado</a>, with his twist on <em>abade de priscos</em>, a strikingly visual pudding – yellow and scarlet from its egg yolks and port caramel, given even more of a shareability factor by the addition of pork fat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f08c80f893ede6e9acc194e7ee4e408e23e4b68e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859101483/397f38d1-2c3b-444d-9363-b0b33c4bdaa2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nuno Mendes' abade de priscos, or pork fat pudding\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuno Mendes’ abade de priscos, or pork fat pudding.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most of the chefs and restaurateurs I speak to are coy about the idea that they would do anything so calculated. When I ask Jonathan Downey, the orchestrator of a sprawling street-food collective, if any of his team deliberately creates dishes in the hopes of online cult status, he laughs. “My God. I thought I was cynical, but <em>you</em> …” Most profess to be taken aback by the sudden stardom. A contender for the most-Instagrammed dish in the UK at the moment must be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/28/french-toast-the-pudding-of-2015\">Shackfuyu’s <em>kinako</em> french toast</a>; general manager Alina Sann says the sheer popularity of this simple dessert took them completely by surprise. “We have quite a small menu and kitchen, so we wanted something easy to make – but it has taken us way beyond what we ever expected,” she says. So why the fandom? “It looks quite cool, especially with the <em>matcha</em> soft-serve on the side. People started posting pictures … it started getting all the hype, and it’s an easy sell for our waiters because they know everyone will love it.”</p> \n<p>The spectacular confit potatoes at the <a href=\"http://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House</a> are another internet smash (and something <a href=\"https://instagram.com/marinagpoloughlin/\">I’m guilty of Instagramming</a> more than once). Chef Shaun Shearly also credits necessity for their genesis: “They were born on the back of really wanting to stay away from a conventional chip – mostly because of space in my little kitchen, and because people expect that fried carb.” What are the downsides of having such a labour-intensive “star” dish? “With potatoes being so variable in water due to their starch levels, they need constant attention. And I can never take them off the menu, despite them being a complete pain in the arse during service. We can only cook three portions at a time, and they take about four minutes to cook. Most tables order at least three portions at a time.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dfd439fb35da835d580ce3bedd3b289da721ba4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859160488/aece8a5b-676d-4af3-8ee9-3552ae8da1a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So it’s all a happy accident, right? Speak to the publicists, however, and a different story emerges. When I ask Hannah Norris, the PR for a number of the capital’s hottest restaurants, if she advises chefs to deliberately devise dishes to grip the internet by the throat, she says: “Yes, I’d encourage it for sure. Content is key – and having a ‘hero’ dish to shout about is often the difference between a stonking launch and a lukewarm one. If a restaurant asks me to do their PR, one of the first questions is, ‘What’s the glory dish? What’s our <a href=\"http://duckandwaffle.com/\">Duck &amp; Waffle</a>?’ If there isn’t one, I often make my excuses and scurry away.”</p> \n<p>With all the chefly coyness, it is refreshing to speak to Stevie Parle, the owner of the newly opened <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk/\">Craft</a> in Greenwich, who is pragmatic about the value of the cult dish. His clay-baked duck actively encourages sharing, not only over dinner but, with his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IZMNy3quzA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">hypnotic video of the bird’s serving ritual</a>, online too. “The duck [served in clay to be smashed at the table] was very conscious,” he says. “Most chefs have always thought about ‘signature’ dishes and generally end up hating them, but now there is an added element of them going viral too.” So they are stuck with them? Yes, says Parle: “I love the duck but it isn’t ever going to be able to come off the menu. And people get really cross if I start smashing it before they’re ready with their cameras.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IZMNy3quzA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4IZMNy3quzA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Franco Sotgiu of Solita in Manchesteralso acknowledges the internet effect. “It pains me to say, but when creating specials I’ve learned that anything with ‘big, fried, bacon or cheese’ in the title sells well. The better they look in a photo on Twitter and Facebook, the more RTs and likes they get, the better they sell.” He is rueful about the side-effects: “In Manchester, ‘dirty’ still sells well, and even though I’ve tried relentlessly to push more grill items and less calorific dishes, the stuff that looks sloppy-great in a photo can often achieve 500-plus RTs on Twitter. So it makes sense from a business point of view to lead with these.”</p> \n<p>It is as simple as bums on seats, then. Instagram snaps are the restaurant’s equivalent of an Amsterdam-style shop window. Viewers scroll through pic after pic, the squelchier, more drooling meat juices on show the better, frequently tagged – ugh – #foodporn. Petra Barran of streetfood collective Kerb says: “Anything oozing melted cheese does really well.” Neil Rankin of the Smokehouse and Bad Egg takes it even further: “Burgers, as long as they are oozy and wet, are a sure thing. Food gets people off without the guilt of objectifying the opposite sex.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2588e7ba41865c8556c05af17f0aa0695968fe57\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859493093/0bc4a537-124b-4c6b-8c4e-b6c6dcb6053b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"St John's doughnuts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St John’s doughnuts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But what’s in it for the tweeters and Instagrammers? The anonymous <a href=\"https://instagram.com/clerkenwellboyec1/\">Clerkenwell Boy</a>, a hugely followed Instagrammer whose account has contributed to the fetishisation of what is frequently dubbed *that* burger or *those* wings, says: “I think there is something fundamentally satisfying about sharing a photo of a brilliant dish with others. I’m no psychologist, but it probably also has links to ‘social proof’ – so posting photos of *that* dish is like providing (and receiving) a universal seal of approval. I guess you could liken it to the way that tourists react when they see a major landmark in a foreign city. Just like the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben, a photo of *that* signature dish means that you’ve arrived.” What does he think it is that captures the imagination so fiercely? “People suffer from massive food envy and fear of missing out. Ordering *that* dish becomes a failsafe way to ensure we don’t make the wrong choice.”</p> \n<p>Not only is there the serotonin rush from watching the likes mount up, but there is the chance of catching the celebs’ eye: a #followoftheday from Nigella or a regram by Jamie. (Nigella’s Instagram of Stevie Parle’s clay duck video has, at the time of writing, more than 2,300 likes.) It creates a circle of validation: the restaurants get the punters, the punters get the likes – behavioural economics. The problem, of course, is that social media is driven by the thrill of the new. Tweeters move on to the next big thing without a backward glance. Six months down the line, there’s a chorus of “we’ve all seen that bloody pithivier”, a mindset that compels chefs and restaurateurs to reach ever more attention-seeking heights, dreaming up the culinary equivalent of Kim Kardashian’s bottom to penetrate the noise. The internet’s appetite for the food rush is insatiable; and if you don’t post that snap of your <a href=\"http://www.crumbsanddoilies.co.uk/\">Crumbs &amp; Doilies</a> cupcake, or doughnut from <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/\">St John</a>, it might not taste as sweet.</p> \n<h2>Eight of the best cult dishes</h2> \n<h2>1. Stevie Parle’s clay-baked duck, <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk/\">Craft</a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd08b5a59ed5ae1218edd55b3c579dc514f0c6b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858033459/33c4b4c8-a8a3-4c71-bcda-193abfbabd18-460x346.jpeg\" alt=\"Clay-baked duck\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clay-baked duck.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Parle wanted a duck dish to rival the <em>canard &agrave; la presse</em> at <a href=\"http://ottos-restaurant.com/food.html\">Otto’s</a> in terms of occasion and fun. Based on an ancient Celtic cooking technique, it is glazed in honey, and wrapped in cabbage leaves and hay before being roasted in a clay wrapper, then delivered on a bed of pine twigs. It is then smashed open at the table and served with broad bean and barley miso, and salted carrots. Much videoed.</p> \n<h2>2. Shaun Searley’s confit potatoes, <a href=\"http://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a88bd2bde8a07bf8f830021740d3f40ec05bc507\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858093982/f0ceeeb9-4bfc-4b0e-8f3c-8669aa2d4864-460x459.jpeg\" alt=\"Confit potatoes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confit potatoes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Thinly sliced potatoes, baked like <em>pommes anna</em> but with dripping instead of butter, then sliced, fried and drizzled with mustard vinaigrette – as delicious as they are complex. Apparently, Shearley played about with a version featuring tunworth cheese and shaved truffle, the sort of thing that may cause one to emit a small moan. The subject of many posts captioned *those* potatoes.</p> \n<h2>3. Wild muntjac biryani, <a href=\"http://www.gymkhanalondon.com/\">Gymkhana </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5036863980e80bf78e840dbd1a39016691c4cb5c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858314804/7aa0f0d1-d790-4fd1-916d-c9cd573e7ac3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wild muntjac biryani\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild muntjac biryani.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is the all-action videos of this ravishing creation that add to its shareable appeal. It arrives with a flaky, domed dough lid, studded with <em>kalonji</em>, to be slit open at the table, releasing the bewitching aromas of spiced deer and buttery basmati rice. If only there were Smellagram too. An uncommon, upscale cult dish.</p> \n<h2>4. Blood cake, <a href=\"http://www.baolondon.com/\">Bao</a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a866d88f63f8bca70236b17883bd8ca52658cea1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858459407/06703ddd-2755-4c4f-8e40-4bc5f57f0328-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Blood cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blood cake.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another one Instagrammed by Nigella, thereby assuring its must-eat status. This is a traditional Taiwanese streetfood made from pig’s blood and glutinous rice. Instead of the usual peanut and coriander condiments – which feature in their classic bao – it is topped with a just-wobbling, soy-cured egg yolk. The Bao owners welcome their dishes’ “Instagrammability”, saying it provides immediate, important feedback. But they insist taste is paramount.</p> \n<h2>5. Bacon naan, <a href=\"http://www.dishoom.com/\">Dishoom </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b697a68b737006eb3c201cc65c07e07ee668842a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858515916/97d655a3-3ab3-472d-bd50-5c9789680c54-460x353.jpeg\" alt=\"Bacon naan.\" width=\"460\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bacon naan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This beauty more than deserves its online fame: a pillowy, gently charred bread stuffed with crisp bacon, cream cheese and tangy chilli-tomato jam. Some add an egg. (A fork piercing yolks in slow-motion is a meme: there are currently 63,307 Instagram post for #eggporn. Sigh.)</p> \n<h2>6. Duck and waffle, <a href=\"http://duckandwaffle.com/\">Duck &amp; Waffle </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3caa3bf3f149e00e3a65c19079e17149d88156e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858581182/3f34216b-67f2-4e76-8382-9a018d74b32b-460x418.jpeg\" alt=\"Duck and waffle\" width=\"460\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duck and waffle.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nothing ensures hero status so much as calling your whole restaurant after one dish. If diners at this City smash aren’t tweeting the view, they’re Instagramming the crisp, fluffy waffles, flanked with confit duck and fried duck egg, the whole to be drenched with mustard maple syrup. The restaurant goes through a reported 7,000 duck legs a month.</p> \n<h2>7.

Tiny lamps are placed on the table to ensure we are not dining in the dark. The result is a dim, quiet, moody space at the Darling Harbour end of the CBD. This part of Sydney is a bit of a wind tunnel and slightly dystopian: home of office blocks and sandwich bars. And for the last five years, Sepia.<br /></p> \n<p>Sepia is the sort of place where you go to celebrate a successful corporate takeover, or being granted a mining lease, or being made partner of your law firm. Or maybe where you mark your 20-year wedding anniversary or the awarding of your Fulbright scholarship or the successful resolution of a long, protracted lawsuit. In other words – it’s a serious place. It is special, grave and slightly forbidding. And that’s just the decor. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTdeON2CnUE\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NTdeON2CnUE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Cracking the gold egg dessert at Sepia. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As for the food, well, it’s pretty amazing, and shows a lightness of touch that is missing in the interior. Some dishes, such as the exploding white chocolate egg dessert, are positively playful.</p> \n<p>But first things first: what sort of food and wine can you expect at Sepia? We had five courses for $160 and $90 for matching wines. In light of the world-class quality of the food and wine, that could be considered good value.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ba9182dc721765b9f5e36bfd3ddd322b337a623\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/0ba9182dc721765b9f5e36bfd3ddd322b337a623/0_57_2448_1636/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The amuse-bouche – salmon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"668\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The amuse-bouche – salmon.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We started with an amuse-bouche – a small bite of salmon with a nest of salmon roe in the middle. Biting down into it, the roe exploded with a satisfying burst of flavour. Two bites and it was gone, but “it wakes up the palate and now you’re hungry”, said my now hungry companion. There’s a slight, delightful trickiness to it and the dish that followed. Was there someone in the kitchen with a syringe injecting the salmon roe into the small, perfectly spherical ball of salmon?</p> \n<p>And in the next course – a sashimi of yellowfin tuna, jam&oacute;n ib&eacute;rico cream avocado, baby radish, ponzu and pork crackling (minute sprinkles like divided snowflakes) – how the hell did the pinky-green cream end up as the filling in the tube of tuna?</p> \n<p>It’s worth marvelling at before consuming, because not only is the food beautifully presented but its construction is a work of art. </p> \n<p>And the wines were exquisitely chosen. The acidity of the 2013 Domaine Mittnacht Freres Gyotaku from Alsace cut through the fat of the cream. Our sommelier – like all the staff we dealt with – was knowledgable and slightly stiff. Which is good, and appropriate. In a place like this, you don’t want your waiters to crouch down, elbows on your table and say: “So have you dined with us before?”</p> \n<p>The next course – matched with a 2013 Jamsheed Roussanne from Beechworth –was tender and crunchy at the same time; the pine mushroom, fried potato, poached quail egg, caviar and roasted chicken powder like a delicious Sydney beachside breakfast in miniature. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e56b56b9f908c8f179f46b7d1745eeeedc52f9bf\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e56b56b9f908c8f179f46b7d1745eeeedc52f9bf/0_0_2105_2807/750.jpg\" alt=\"Pine mushroom, fried potato, poached quail egg, caviar, roasted chicken powder.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pine mushroom, fried potato, poached quail egg, caviar and roasted chicken powder.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the kitchen playing with texture – as well as flavour. The potato was crispy and looked like a bird’s nest; the quail’s egg was soft and runny, the mushrooms were the most flavoursome I’ve had. Together they were interesting and full of flavour without being overwhelming. </p> \n<p>“It’s got grip and a savoury edge, it walks a wonderful tightrope,” said my friend. “And it’s so seasonal. You can only get this sort of dish in Sydney, at this time of the year.”<br />He also liked that the plate was warmed appropriately for the temperature of the dish.</p> \n<p>In between courses we were served a milky bun with butter, and then came our favourite wine of the evening, a ros&eacute; from Georgia, the 2013 Pheasant’s Tears.</p> \n<p>“It’s a phantom!” exclaimed my friend. “It’s there and it’s not. No smell, no taste, nothing.” He sniffed this mysterious ruby wine. “Slight nose ... it just falls of the edge of a cliff.”</p> \n<p>The wine was paired with a crab dish (with dashimaki tamago, egg rice, kabosu, blood plum, hijiki and wild wood sorrel) that was the most comfort-food-y dish on the menu – all the softness and flavour of a Japanese omelette, with the sharp tartness of the blood plum cutting through the egginess.</p> \n<p>Our last savoury dish was the most dramatic looking. The Wagyu sirloin was finely sliced and layered, with the dark sculpture of reshaped mushroom placed on the meat like a work of art. It threw shadows the shape of antlers across the plate. Food that looks like this is almost (but not quite) too good to eat. Thank God for Instagram which will allow the memory of the perishable to remain in perpetuity.</p> \n<p>Save room for dessert. We got the white chocolate egg which, when cracked, spills treats like a pi&ntilde;ata, popping candy the flavour of finger lime and the sharp acidity of sherbet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a32e5771cb4a6fa20293943b9199dc24dbef4e2e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a32e5771cb4a6fa20293943b9199dc24dbef4e2e/0_0_2232_2992/746.jpg\" alt=\"The autumn chocolate forest dessert.\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The autumn chocolate forest dessert.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It’s a classic Spanish technique,” said my friend. “Very moulded shell, very molecular.”</p> \n<p>But not too molecular. This is still food with a lot of heart.</p> \n<p>We also shared an “autumn chocolate forest” which felt like eating a mash-up of Willy Wonka and Walt Whitman. It was nature and a forest floor as reimagined and made edible with soft chocolate, hazelnut and almond, lavender and honey cream blackberry sorbet, blueberry and rosewater jellies, green tea, <strong>l</strong>iquorice, chocolate twigs and bronze fennel.</p> \n<p>Oh, maybe you don’t need to wait until your planning permit comes through from council to build a 30-storey residential tower or you wind up giving your evidence at Icac. Maybe you should just go there because the food is so good and glorious.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/58a83c03d8c88efc64d4a211b5900a068a646db0/0_0_3045_1827/3045.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1827,"width":3045,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Brigid Delaney for the Guardian","altText":"King crab, dashimaki tamago, egg rice, kabosu, blood plum, hijiki and wild wood sorrel, as served at Sepia in Sydney.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0ba9182dc721765b9f5e36bfd3ddd322b337a623/0_57_2448_1636/2448.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1636,"width":2448,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The amuse-bouche – salmon.

But the girls, who spend half their time in Paris where Darroze oversees her other restaurant, got stuck on a delayed Eurostar.</p> \n<p>Charlotte was convinced that the prize would be a bottle of champagne (the award was sponsored by Veuve Clicquot), so Darroze had to take a photo of the trophy on her phone and send it to her to prove otherwise.</p> \n<p>“They should have been there,” Darroze says now, back in professional mode and talking over the phone from her Paris restaurant with the sound of clattering dishes in the background. “I regret it. For me, it was really important and they wanted to see it. I think they realised it was something special.”</p> \n<p>At 48, Darroze is that rare thing: a mother and a female chef operating at the top of her game in an industry still overwhelmingly dominated by men. On the same evening that she won her prestigious award, the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, as compiled by trade publication <em>Restaurant</em> magazine from an academy of more than 1,000 members, was revealed. Of that list, fewer than 4% of the kitchens were run by women.</p> \n<p>“The fact is we’re a minority, I know that,” says Darroze phlegmatically. A diminutive, forthright woman with wavy blond hair and a ready smile, she could be easily underestimated. This would be a mistake. She was born and raised in south-west France, where her parents ran a restaurant, and she was taught to cook by her grandmothers. Her first experience of a professional kitchen was at the age of 23 when, after a business degree at university, she got a job at Alain Ducasse’s Louis XV restaurant in Monaco. At the time, Darroze was the only woman in the brigade. For several months, she was authorised only to wash the lettuce. She did so without complaint, asking questions and taking notes on what was going on around her whenever she could.</p> \n<p>Three years later, she returned to run her family restaurant. By 1999, she was opening her own place in Paris, winning her first Michelin star in 2001 and gaining a slew of high-profile admirers, including the former French president Jacques Chirac and the actress Salma Hayek.</p> \n<p>Despite her professional success, Darroze considers motherhood the most important role in her life. She always wanted to have children but never met “the right man” and so, at the age of 40, decided to take matters into her own hands and adopt a baby girl from Vietnam (she returned, two years later, for her younger daughter).</p> \n<p>“Before 40, I don’t think it would have been possible for a few reasons,” she says. “First, I didn’t have in place a team strong enough to support me. I had to trust my team and be able to delegate because I wanted to be a mother who could spend time with my children … Second, because I often start work at 8.30 and come back at 11.30 or midnight, sometimes only with one hour of pause, and normally I work at least five days a week – of course I need two nannies. So on the financial side, there is a lot, and before 40 I didn’t have enough money.”</p> \n<p>She says it was beyond her control whether she adopted a boy or a girl, but “I admit, I was really happy it was like that”.</p> \n<p>Are women put off a career as a chef because they cannot see a way of juggling work and children? “Yes, it’s happened a lot of times in my kitchen. [I’ve seen] so many young women in their late 20s and early 30s and I was sure they could be the next H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Darroze or Anne-Sophie Pic [Pic has won three Michelin stars for her restaurant in south-east France] and unfortunately they say, ‘No, I want to be a wife and have a baby.’ Unfortunately they couldn’t do both at this age. When you want to be a chef at this level, it’s tricky.”</p> \n<p>Darroze is clear-sighted about the fact there is very little to be done about this because restaurant hours are always going to be long and arduous. The only thing that can change is, she says, “a woman’s mindset and that’s really difficult because when you’re a mother, of course you want to spend time with your baby. That’s humanity. I think this problem will be around for ever. It’s a big conflict in the head. I used to say if I was in love with a man who wanted to have a baby and get married to me at 32, I’m not sure I’d be here.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"841452270060ed11d5d0d213377b06948c7e63f9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/6/1433600214062/171ea289-cef3-44bb-abbf-df56d83e0ed6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Darroze trained with Alain Ducasse at his Louis XV restaurant in Monaco; for months, she was only allowed to wash the lettuce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darroze trained with Alain Ducasse at his Louis XV restaurant in Monaco; for months, she was only allowed to wash the lettuce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Hache/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s rare, I suggest, to hear a successful woman speak so openly about her desire to get married and settle down. “I am honest,” she says, and you can almost sense her shrugging her shoulders on the other end of the phone line.</p> \n<p>She is often asked what advice she would give wannabe female chefs and her response is always the same: “I say: ‘OK, be a woman. Never try to be a guy and you will be respected.’”</p> \n<p>Darroze insists she has never experienced sexism in her career, although she admits that some of her contemporaries have. But, as a rule, she is not much given to moaning. Her attitude has always been simply to get on with things and work hard. Ducasse once told her that, if she wanted to be a success, she should “notice everything. Don’t forget anything.”</p> \n<p>It is advice that has served her well. Darroze says she felt “big emotion” on receiving the award for the world’s best female chef. But isn’t it patronising to have a special prize just for women?</p> \n<p>“No. Like every minority, we have some special awards,” she replies. “On the contrary, I take that as an opportunity to speak about us [female chefs]. I take it as a good thing, as motivation to other women.”</p> \n<p>In her acceptance speech, Darroze made reference to the fact that, for the first time since her Paris restaurant opened in 1999, women now outnumber men in the kitchen. It was “not deliberate”, she says, but rather a function of the fact that there are far more female students at culinary school in France than male. As a result, she gets more women than men applying for jobs. “It’s not a personal choice – just a matter of fact and circumstance. It reflects what could happen in the future. It will be challenging because we [men and women] don’t have the same sensibility or reaction when it comes to cooking.”</p> \n<p>In what way?</p> \n<p>“Women are very instinctive, they listen to their emotions. The guys want to put something [on the plate] to show something. They think, at the beginning, of a technique they want to show, and then follow the story. We [women] think about emotion first and then put the technique on that after.</p> \n<p>“The two ways are very respectable and very different. There are some exceptions, of course. I know some male chefs who are very feminine and some female chefs who are very male.”</p> \n<p>But, generally speaking, does she think she would be able to tell whether a dish was cooked by a woman or a man in a blind tasting?</p> \n<p>“I think so,” she replies.</p> \n<p>I ask if she sees the same emotional attachment to food in her daughters, and she laughs. Both her children have a taste for spice and Charlotte was eating sushi with wasabi at the age of one.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know if it’s in their blood or DNA,” she says. “But they also like the things all kids love – the bolognese pasta, the chicken nuggets.” Darroze stops, then adds hurriedly: “Home-made ones, for sure.”</p> \n<p>Well, of course. When your mother is the world’s best female chef, it would be foolish not to make the most of it.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/5/1433527498181/H-l-ne-Darroze-in-her-Par-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hélène Darroze in her Paris restaurant, where women now outnumber men in the kitchen.
