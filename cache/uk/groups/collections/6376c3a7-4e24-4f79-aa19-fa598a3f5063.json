No prizes for guessing which one our critic prefers</p>","byline":"Marina O'Loughlin","body":"<p>This is a tale of two pubs. On the surface, very similar: both deep in the chocolate-box depths of the Kentish countryside, a landscape dotted with thatches, weathered brick and wonky, mullioned windows, where fat bumblebees drone and the air is fragranced with freshly-cut grass. Both in historic buildings, both aiming to provide more than the basic country pub beer and scratchings. But they couldn’t be more different if they tried.</p> \n<p>The first, <a href=\"http://thedukewilliamickham.com\">the Duke William in Ickham</a>, comes from a big-name chef. <a href=\"http://www.marksargeant.net\">Mark Sargeant</a> is ex-Ramsay and, like so many of the sweary one’s alumni, has set about empire building. Sticking to his Kentish roots, here he is with his own local: the fantasy gig for many a man <em>d’un certain &acirc;ge</em>. It’s been Farrow &amp; Balled to within an inch of its life, dark grey cocoons the interior, fur throws are scattered over wooden settles, there are numerous “quirky” touches (filament lightbulbs, decorative trays, mini Etch-a-Sketches).</p> \n<p>Over two visits, we make major inroads into the menu, from sausage rolls to ice-cream. It’s all… OK. That’s about as excited as I can get about lamb neck curry served with a dome of plain rice and a vague aura of <a href=\"http://www.curry-recipes.co.uk/imagehost/pics/288f7ede0bdf03d61ab6b5923d36c77d.jpg\">Vesta</a>. Or roast beef, served in a steak-like slab and defiantly repelling the knife. P&acirc;t&eacute;, with a milky disc of fat on top, chicken livers granular with a backnote of bitterness. Potted Dungeness shrimp, the butter properly softened, have an offputting metallic quality, though that might be me grinding my fillings at the &pound;10.50 price-tag. Local “heritage” tomatoes are plonked on commercial-tasting not-very-sourdough with <a href=\"http://www.goldencrosscheese.co.uk\">Golden Cross goat’s cheese</a>, no oil, butter or dressing to add lubrication or allure. Fish pie is heavy on potato, light on fish, its white sauce watery. There’s a “tankered” (sic) of prawns. Chips – decent, homemade – come in a bloody flowerpot.</p> \n<p>Staff are friendly, and remember us when we visit again, possibly because the first time they chased us out into the street for not paying (we had, obviously). But the training isn’t there: they bring malbec (red) instead of macabeo (white); finished plates are left uncleared; when none of the billed vanilla ice-cream arrives with a pedestrian apple crumble, we get a shrug and, “The kitchen is really busy.” Erm, we’re the only people in the dining area.</p> \n<p>You know what? It’s good enough – if you got this at a random pitstop, you’d be mildly chuffed – but from a “name” chef, you expect more. It’s clear, with its curry nights and steak nights, that the brief for the Duke William is “proper community pub”. Problem is, no number of Kentish Gypsy tarts or guest ales will make me believe that for a moment.</p> \n<p>Our other pub comes unburdened by names or makeovers. Down the road in less picturesque Crundale is <a href=\"http://www.thecompassescrundale.co.uk\">The Compasses</a>, an 18th-century hostelry with none of ye olde English attitude you expect from that heritage. You brave some extremely free-range chickens to enter, there are garlands of hops and an inglenook fireplace, but the mood is workmanlike, not twee. Rob Taylor runs it with his wife, Donna; he’s alone in the kitchen. His food is warming, like a hug: pasties stuffed with lamb and onion, perfect for dunking in homemade mushroom ketchup. Ox cheek, slow-cooked until spoonable, comes with a dollop of mustard-laced clotted cream, its richness pooling over the meat; crisp shallots add texture. Garnet-coloured wild pigeon breasts with sharp rhubarb and a bonbon of deep-fried black pudding. Local crab wrapped in supple, homemade cannelloni sit in a rich seafood bisque. Vegetables are given starring roles in the likes of a salt-baked celeriac dish, the root rendered sultry and languid, reclining in a pool of roast garlic cream. Spuds are basted in dripping while they roast into fudgy perfection. Brioche bread-and-butter pudding with marmalade custard delivers purest, sticky pleasure.</p> \n<p>One boozer is jazz-handsing and tap-dancing as a sleight away from its ordinariness. (Sargeant has told the trade press that <a href=\"http://www.bighospitality.co.uk/Venues/Mark-Sargeant-pub-preview\">he has “no plan to chase accolades”</a> here. Just as well, eh?) The other is quietly going about its business of being genuinely excellent – it reminds me of the early days of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/26/the-sportsman-seasalter-restaurant-review\">the Sportsman in Seasalter</a>.

I want it brought to me, or, if necessary, I want me brought to it. I won’t hold my breath, because I really doubt there is one. The joy is not simply in the cooking, though it does possess the sort of vigour and attitude that makes properly greedy people swoon. It’s in the simplicity of the offering, the straightforwardness, the resolute lack of tiresome, self-regarding flimflam and hauteur. Their approach comes down to this: we cooked some stuff; we think you might like it.</p> \n<p>Oh, but I do.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e78fbd02745ea48c95e564f60ed7352d72c536a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434713929063/6e28a12c-12ed-4294-a1b6-318b5efe8941-460x439.jpeg\" alt=\"Marksman's devilled mussels\" width=\"460\" height=\"439\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Glossy fat meats on a chunk of sourdough toast’: devilled mussels.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This doesn’t come as a huge surprise. I visited the pub out of profound irritation with last week’s dreary misunderstanding of Vietnamese cooking at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/14/leicester-house-restaurant-review-jay-rayner\">Leicester House</a>. The Marksman is where Tom Harris, the previous chef in that space – both when it was the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2011/may/29/jay-rayner-restaurant-review-st-john-hotel\">St John Hotel</a> and 1 Leicester Street – went next, to team up with Jon Rotheram, formerly of Jamie Oliver’s 15. I needed my faith restored and I believed a short trip to London E2 would do so.</p> \n<p>For those now wringing their hands over the violation of an old wood-panelled pub, one perhaps pretending to be as streetwise as a public school boy in artfully distressed Doc Martens when in truth it’s actually now just a restaurant, relax. This one really is still a pub. There’s a bar, propped up by blokes who look like they’ve done this sort of heavy lifting in many boozers down the years. There are beers on tap, including local offerings, such as the Bethnal Blonde, a light straw-coloured beer brewed just 300 metres away. There’s a juke box. Mind you, there are also neatly appointed green leather banquettes, none of which are split so the stuffing’s bursting out. Give it time. They’ve only just opened.</p> \n<p>The menu is divided between 10 small dishes priced between &pound;4 and &pound;8, and four in the mid-teens. Almost nothing disappoints; much makes us sigh; a few make me dab the moisture from my eyes. Brown shrimp rissoles are more akin to Spanish croquettes, the nutty little darlings set in the lightest of b&eacute;chamels that must stay together in the hot fat through sheer strength of personality. Don’t pop one of these in your mouth whole or it will be a trip to matron for you. They come with a pokey romesco-like aioli for dredging purposes, which gives spiky corners to the soft, rounded flavours. Devilled mussels on toast are glossy fat meats on a chunk of sourdough toast, the whole bathed in a light broth given attitude and conviction by the application of chilli.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"578fc2fa374890def53ddbec4fbd218081bf85f4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434714176439/895bb0db-db14-4d17-9735-059c5a84f022-460x454.jpeg\" alt=\"Marksman's curried kid\" width=\"460\" height=\"454\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘A depth of flavour best measured by sonar’: curried kid.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another piece of toast comes heavily smeared with sweet, crushed peas and piled with a mixture of pea shoots, shaved violet artichokes and grated Bermondsey hard press, a smooth, salty cheese that’s planning to be mates with Gruy&egrave;re when it grows up. Fresher still is a salad of cos lettuce, with halved radishes, rounds of pickled cucumber and a sharp buttermilk dressing. This is a salad for people suspicious of them. It’s a mound of revitalisation and briskness.</p> \n<p>It’s also a necessary foil to the beef and barley bun, a glazed dome of soft bread roll containing a filling of finely diced braised beef. Fresh horseradish is grated over the top, and on the side is a thick puddle of sauce flavoured with more of the same. Think of it as Britain’s answer to the Chinese char siu bun. You tear through the bread to find – puff – a thick filling of meatiness in long-reduced jus. This is a self-mopping stew. It is one of those gloriously simple items, which requires lots of thought, care and precision.</p> \n<p>Next, from the bigger dishes, a huge-flavoured curry of young goat. Some might call it oily. I’ll call it luscious. The temptation with these Anglo takes on Caribbean cooking is to chuck in the sugars, be it from palm or granulated. Here, any sweetness comes from the natural caramelisation of the meat, and a buxom dollop of punchy tomato chutney. The rest is fire and spice, and a depth of flavour best measured by sonar. The one duff note was the sourdough roti on the side: one of the toughest, least yielding pieces of bread I have ever come across. Perhaps the glutens had been overworked.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6d6802940bdc51b5a01bf345653be100df58bd9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434714823713/2e6295a4-c569-4edb-87bb-6276cb689c18-460x421.jpeg\" alt=\"butter and honey tart\" width=\"460\" height=\"421\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘The deep caramel filling has the wobble and softness of a newborn’s thigh’: butter and honey tart.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Happily, honour on the carb front was saved by the innocent-sounding fried potatoes with a burnt onion mayonnaise. Gosh. These could be the saviour of the public house, swiftly stopping all closures. Behold: finely sliced potatoes, long cooked in the oven, then pressed and chilled before being cut into 6in planks and deep fried to an umber-tinged golden. Each one is like a dozen of the best chips ever, pressed together. It is the potato raised up high to the status of luxury item or, better still, brought down low to the level of crack. And alongside, because this might not be enough, is that poke-in-the-eye of a mayo full of deep, dark-roasted onion tones. (Credit where it’s due: the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/mar/02/quality-chop-house-london-restaurant-review\">Quality Chophouse</a> in Farringdon has served something similar for a while now.)</p> \n<p>A few years ago, when I visited the St John Hotel to write about it, Tom Harris leant over the counter of the open kitchen and ordered me to have his custard tart. I did as I was told, and it was indeed a wonder of crisp pastry and deep-filled set custard with just the slightest wobble. Those skills are on display here again in a similar tart of brown butter and honey, sitting alone on the plate unadorned, cut to a perfect point. The pastry snaps. The deep, buttery caramel filling has the wobble and softness of a newborn’s thigh. Naturally it eclipses a scoop or two of buttermilk ice cream with sweet-sour pickled pear and the crunch of oats. But then it would eclipse anything.</p> \n<p>And all of this, delivered to the bare wood pub tables with the minimum of fuss, and a soundtrack of 50s jazz from that jukebox. The temptation when one comes across such perfect poise is to blunder into hyperbole, but I never, ever, ever do that. Instead I’ll now follow their lead and do pared back and restrained. Go to the Marksman. It’s good. You might like it.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s news bites</h2> \n<p>■ For more top pub food served with the minimum of fuss try the White Swan at Fence in Lancashire, where young chef Tom Parker is knocking out the likes of oxtail cottage pie made with smoked mash and bone marrow, or plaice with roasted garlic potatoes and langoustine sauce.

But on Thursday came reports that <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/finance/money/is-this-the-beginning-of-the-end-for-sizzler/story-fnagkbpv-1227414367982\">its parent company would be shutting some of its remaining restaurants</a>. If Sizzler had been in a coma, it’s now contracted pneumonia.</p> \n<p>Let’s just say the phone rings. The voice at the other end says: “Your father doesn’t have long. If you can get on a plane, this might be your last chance to see him”. Australia, this is that phone call. Your father is Sizzler. Get on that plane. </p> \n<p>From its heyday in the 1990s, Sizzler has just 25 stores left across Australia, mostly in regional towns in Queensland, where there are 18 stores. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"328be8fc79a3c341d517c8db36834c0f89b56db1\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/328be8fc79a3c341d517c8db36834c0f89b56db1/0_30_604_362/500.jpg\" alt=\"Sizzler salad menu\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">All you can eat salad at Sizzler – for only $11.25.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Humphries</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The last time I went to Sizzler was out of nostalgia, not hunger. Some friends and I wanted to recapture something of our childhoods, so took a trip to one of the only three remaining Sizzler restaurants in Sydney. In the new millenium, Sizzler restaurants had become outcasts, scattered out far away from Sydney’s CBD. </p> \n<p>For kids of the 90s, there are certain Sydney landmarks which held special meaning. For me, they were Sizzler, Wonderland, Old Sydney Town and, to a lesser extent, Sega World. Of those four, only Sizzler remained open, so it become the destination for our bittersweet journey. The nearest Sizzler to us was in Carramar, a suburb 30km from the city, which will now always be associated with my own endless salad bar version of the Last Supper.</p> \n<p>The door to the restaurant declared: “We request our guests maintain a neat, casual standard of dress. (Footwear MUST be worn)”. </p> \n<p>The words “all-you-can-eat” and “dress code” don’t always go hand in hand, but Sizzler was the exception. </p> \n<p>We surveyed the menu but, in truth, we were only there for the complimentary cheese toast. I don’t care to know what caused Sizzler’s demise but I think you have to wonder about the financial viability of a business whose flagship meal item – cheese toast – was free.</p> \n<p>You really can’t overstate the brilliance of <a href=\"http://www.news.com.au/finance/business/heres-the-sizzler-cheese-bread-recipe/story-fnkgdftz-1227415724258\">Sizzler’s cheese toast</a>. If Sizzler’s owners had any sense, they’d rebrand as a chain of restaurants called Just Cheese Toast. Sizzler’s version – crunchy on the top but soft on the bottom – is like butter chicken at an Indian restaurant: it’s really all we were there for.</p> \n<p>But don’t try to tempt me with the salad bar. Although it was described in advertising as “endless”, for me it was beginningless. Urban legends about bacteria and the sight of some customers choosing to ditch tongs in lieu of their own fingers made it a no-go zone.</p> \n<p>We left Carramar, pregnant with food and looking like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Junior. Had we eaten well? God, no. Had we eaten all we could? You’d better believe it.<br /></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fef682c8ede3f0237c660e630a527eba19c05713/0_54_604_362/604.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":362,"width":604,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mark Humphries","altText":"Mark Humphries at a Sizzler restaurant","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mark Humphries"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/328be8fc79a3c341d517c8db36834c0f89b56db1/0_30_604_362/604.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":362,"width":604,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"All you can eat salad at Sizzler – for only $11.25.

They’re honking with hilarity, phones clicking like dolphins. Who knows what’s causing the mirth – maybe the Buckfast ice-cream (notorious fortified wine, known locally as “Electric Soup”), or the burger topped with Smith’s bacon crisps, or the Irn-Bru pork. The “Mad Chef” at <a href=\"http://bloc.ru/\">Bloc</a> specialises in OTT food designed not so much to be savoured as to cause a commotion. Especially online. His Pot Noodle burger might be revolting, but it is a wholly successful piece of attention-grabbing. Love it or loathe it – and there is a startling number for whom the very idea causes a foam of fury – the marriage of food and social media isn’t going away any time soon.</p> \n<p>The internet has become increasingly food-obsessed since the early days when a slightly fetishistic subculture known as “foodies” would post pictures of <a href=\"http://www.tayyabs.co.uk/\">Tayyabs</a>’s legendary lamb chops on hilariously clunky sites such as <a href=\"http://forums.egullet.org/\">eGullet</a>. Today, it is impossible to scroll through any timeline without encountering other people’s lunches, and, worldwide, there is an increase in dishes that appear to be deliberately engineered to get you snapping before tucking in. Take the <a href=\"http://www.carmelwines.co.il/en/aboutus.aspx\">Carmel Winery</a> in Israel with its Foodography tasting menu, featuring as many flowers and twiddles as you can shake a tweezer at, and its “Limbo” crockery that incorporates a mobile-phone stand. The international chain <a href=\"http://www.chilis.com/EN/Pages/home.aspx\">Chili’s</a> has just appointed a consultancy that came up with egg wash to make its burger buns more photogenic and “shareable”; the cost – <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/instagram-food-taste-study-research/\">a cool $750,000</a>. You’re scoffing? Research suggests<a href=\"http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_CHILIS_PHOTOGENIC_BUNS?SITE=AP\"> that photographing your food makes it taste better</a> (it’s all to do with ritual and savouring).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e6b36a49dc96db131f97e3ef844fa7cafd7cae5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859293548/37b28b1e-82cb-448d-8f2d-096be9381abd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Meat fruit at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meat fruit at Dinner by Heston Blumenthal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ashley Palmer-Watts</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It has been going on for a few years now. In 2011, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2010/dec/02/heston-blumenthal-christmas-canapes-meat\">Heston Blumenthal created his “meat fruit”</a>, a chicken-liver parfait coated in jelly and fashioned into a startling facsimile of a tangerine. This coincided with a massive spike in Twitter usage and, lo, the delicately dimpled orange was everywhere. In the US, Frankenstein creations such as the cronut were tweeted like the second coming. Earlier still, then-young gun David Chang’s nascent empire was fuelled by fans gibbering about his pork buns online. He played to the crowd, and suddenly everyone knew about Taiwanese-style buns. Soon diners were working as unpaid marketeers for their favourite restaurants, a paradigm fully exploited in the UK by clued-up new restaurateurs such as Russell Norman of <a href=\"http://www.polpo.co.uk/\">Polpo</a> and Scott Collins of <a href=\"http://meatliquor.com/\">MeatLiquor</a>.</p> \n<p>Now everyone’s at it. Are these chefs and restaurateurs pulling our strings? The more serious, cerebral types will deny there is any such manipulation at play. When the <a href=\"http://www.chilternfirehouse.com/\">Chiltern Firehouse</a> landed in London, a new star was born: chef Nuno Mendes’ crab doughnuts. Did he know that they were going to be as much of a draw as the chance of clocking Kate Moss? Not according to Mendes: “They were an experiment at [his previous restaurant] Viajante that only saw the light of day when we opened the Firehouse,” he says. “I just didn’t have the right space to serve them. Some ideas stay in your head for years before they find their way out.” I believe him, although I suspect he knows exactly what he’s doing at his new place, <a href=\"http://www.tabernamercado.co.uk/\">Taberna do Mercado</a>, with his twist on <em>abade de priscos</em>, a strikingly visual pudding – yellow and scarlet from its egg yolks and port caramel, given even more of a shareability factor by the addition of pork fat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"f08c80f893ede6e9acc194e7ee4e408e23e4b68e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859101483/397f38d1-2c3b-444d-9363-b0b33c4bdaa2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nuno Mendes' abade de priscos, or pork fat pudding\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nuno Mendes’ abade de priscos, or pork fat pudding.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most of the chefs and restaurateurs I speak to are coy about the idea that they would do anything so calculated. When I ask Jonathan Downey, the orchestrator of a sprawling street-food collective, if any of his team deliberately creates dishes in the hopes of online cult status, he laughs. “My God. I thought I was cynical, but <em>you</em> …” Most profess to be taken aback by the sudden stardom. A contender for the most-Instagrammed dish in the UK at the moment must be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/28/french-toast-the-pudding-of-2015\">Shackfuyu’s <em>kinako</em> french toast</a>; general manager Alina Sann says the sheer popularity of this simple dessert took them completely by surprise. “We have quite a small menu and kitchen, so we wanted something easy to make – but it has taken us way beyond what we ever expected,” she says. So why the fandom? “It looks quite cool, especially with the <em>matcha</em> soft-serve on the side. People started posting pictures … it started getting all the hype, and it’s an easy sell for our waiters because they know everyone will love it.”</p> \n<p>The spectacular confit potatoes at the <a href=\"http://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House</a> are another internet smash (and something <a href=\"https://instagram.com/marinagpoloughlin/\">I’m guilty of Instagramming</a> more than once). Chef Shaun Shearly also credits necessity for their genesis: “They were born on the back of really wanting to stay away from a conventional chip – mostly because of space in my little kitchen, and because people expect that fried carb.” What are the downsides of having such a labour-intensive “star” dish? “With potatoes being so variable in water due to their starch levels, they need constant attention. And I can never take them off the menu, despite them being a complete pain in the arse during service. We can only cook three portions at a time, and they take about four minutes to cook. Most tables order at least three portions at a time.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1dfd439fb35da835d580ce3bedd3b289da721ba4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859160488/aece8a5b-676d-4af3-8ee9-3552ae8da1a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So it’s all a happy accident, right? Speak to the publicists, however, and a different story emerges. When I ask Hannah Norris, the PR for a number of the capital’s hottest restaurants, if she advises chefs to deliberately devise dishes to grip the internet by the throat, she says: “Yes, I’d encourage it for sure. Content is key – and having a ‘hero’ dish to shout about is often the difference between a stonking launch and a lukewarm one. If a restaurant asks me to do their PR, one of the first questions is, ‘What’s the glory dish? What’s our <a href=\"http://duckandwaffle.com/\">Duck &amp; Waffle</a>?’ If there isn’t one, I often make my excuses and scurry away.”</p> \n<p>With all the chefly coyness, it is refreshing to speak to Stevie Parle, the owner of the newly opened <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk/\">Craft</a> in Greenwich, who is pragmatic about the value of the cult dish. His clay-baked duck actively encourages sharing, not only over dinner but, with his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IZMNy3quzA&amp;feature=youtu.be\">hypnotic video of the bird’s serving ritual</a>, online too. “The duck [served in clay to be smashed at the table] was very conscious,” he says. “Most chefs have always thought about ‘signature’ dishes and generally end up hating them, but now there is an added element of them going viral too.” So they are stuck with them? Yes, says Parle: “I love the duck but it isn’t ever going to be able to come off the menu. And people get really cross if I start smashing it before they’re ready with their cameras.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4IZMNy3quzA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4IZMNy3quzA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Franco Sotgiu of Solita in Manchesteralso acknowledges the internet effect. “It pains me to say, but when creating specials I’ve learned that anything with ‘big, fried, bacon or cheese’ in the title sells well. The better they look in a photo on Twitter and Facebook, the more RTs and likes they get, the better they sell.” He is rueful about the side-effects: “In Manchester, ‘dirty’ still sells well, and even though I’ve tried relentlessly to push more grill items and less calorific dishes, the stuff that looks sloppy-great in a photo can often achieve 500-plus RTs on Twitter. So it makes sense from a business point of view to lead with these.”</p> \n<p>It is as simple as bums on seats, then. Instagram snaps are the restaurant’s equivalent of an Amsterdam-style shop window. Viewers scroll through pic after pic, the squelchier, more drooling meat juices on show the better, frequently tagged – ugh – #foodporn. Petra Barran of streetfood collective Kerb says: “Anything oozing melted cheese does really well.” Neil Rankin of the Smokehouse and Bad Egg takes it even further: “Burgers, as long as they are oozy and wet, are a sure thing. Food gets people off without the guilt of objectifying the opposite sex.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2588e7ba41865c8556c05af17f0aa0695968fe57\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859493093/0bc4a537-124b-4c6b-8c4e-b6c6dcb6053b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"St John's doughnuts\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">St John’s doughnuts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patricia Niven</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But what’s in it for the tweeters and Instagrammers? The anonymous <a href=\"https://instagram.com/clerkenwellboyec1/\">Clerkenwell Boy</a>, a hugely followed Instagrammer whose account has contributed to the fetishisation of what is frequently dubbed *that* burger or *those* wings, says: “I think there is something fundamentally satisfying about sharing a photo of a brilliant dish with others. I’m no psychologist, but it probably also has links to ‘social proof’ – so posting photos of *that* dish is like providing (and receiving) a universal seal of approval. I guess you could liken it to the way that tourists react when they see a major landmark in a foreign city. Just like the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben, a photo of *that* signature dish means that you’ve arrived.” What does he think it is that captures the imagination so fiercely? “People suffer from massive food envy and fear of missing out. Ordering *that* dish becomes a failsafe way to ensure we don’t make the wrong choice.”</p> \n<p>Not only is there the serotonin rush from watching the likes mount up, but there is the chance of catching the celebs’ eye: a #followoftheday from Nigella or a regram by Jamie. (Nigella’s Instagram of Stevie Parle’s clay duck video has, at the time of writing, more than 2,300 likes.) It creates a circle of validation: the restaurants get the punters, the punters get the likes – behavioural economics. The problem, of course, is that social media is driven by the thrill of the new. Tweeters move on to the next big thing without a backward glance. Six months down the line, there’s a chorus of “we’ve all seen that bloody pithivier”, a mindset that compels chefs and restaurateurs to reach ever more attention-seeking heights, dreaming up the culinary equivalent of Kim Kardashian’s bottom to penetrate the noise. The internet’s appetite for the food rush is insatiable; and if you don’t post that snap of your <a href=\"http://www.crumbsanddoilies.co.uk/\">Crumbs &amp; Doilies</a> cupcake, or doughnut from <a href=\"https://www.stjohngroup.uk.com/\">St John</a>, it might not taste as sweet.</p> \n<h2>Eight of the best cult dishes</h2> \n<h2>1. Stevie Parle’s clay-baked duck, <a href=\"http://craft-london.co.uk/\">Craft</a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd08b5a59ed5ae1218edd55b3c579dc514f0c6b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858033459/33c4b4c8-a8a3-4c71-bcda-193abfbabd18-460x346.jpeg\" alt=\"Clay-baked duck\" width=\"460\" height=\"346\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clay-baked duck.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Parle wanted a duck dish to rival the <em>canard &agrave; la presse</em> at <a href=\"http://ottos-restaurant.com/food.html\">Otto’s</a> in terms of occasion and fun. Based on an ancient Celtic cooking technique, it is glazed in honey, and wrapped in cabbage leaves and hay before being roasted in a clay wrapper, then delivered on a bed of pine twigs. It is then smashed open at the table and served with broad bean and barley miso, and salted carrots. Much videoed.</p> \n<h2>2. Shaun Searley’s confit potatoes, <a href=\"http://thequalitychophouse.com/\">Quality Chop House </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a88bd2bde8a07bf8f830021740d3f40ec05bc507\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858093982/f0ceeeb9-4bfc-4b0e-8f3c-8669aa2d4864-460x459.jpeg\" alt=\"Confit potatoes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"459\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confit potatoes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Thinly sliced potatoes, baked like <em>pommes anna</em> but with dripping instead of butter, then sliced, fried and drizzled with mustard vinaigrette – as delicious as they are complex. Apparently, Shearley played about with a version featuring tunworth cheese and shaved truffle, the sort of thing that may cause one to emit a small moan. The subject of many posts captioned *those* potatoes.</p> \n<h2>3. Wild muntjac biryani, <a href=\"http://www.gymkhanalondon.com/\">Gymkhana </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5036863980e80bf78e840dbd1a39016691c4cb5c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858314804/7aa0f0d1-d790-4fd1-916d-c9cd573e7ac3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wild muntjac biryani\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild muntjac biryani.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is the all-action videos of this ravishing creation that add to its shareable appeal. It arrives with a flaky, domed dough lid, studded with <em>kalonji</em>, to be slit open at the table, releasing the bewitching aromas of spiced deer and buttery basmati rice. If only there were Smellagram too. An uncommon, upscale cult dish.</p> \n<h2>4. Blood cake, <a href=\"http://www.baolondon.com/\">Bao</a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a866d88f63f8bca70236b17883bd8ca52658cea1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858459407/06703ddd-2755-4c4f-8e40-4bc5f57f0328-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Blood cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blood cake.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another one Instagrammed by Nigella, thereby assuring its must-eat status. This is a traditional Taiwanese streetfood made from pig’s blood and glutinous rice. Instead of the usual peanut and coriander condiments – which feature in their classic bao – it is topped with a just-wobbling, soy-cured egg yolk. The Bao owners welcome their dishes’ “Instagrammability”, saying it provides immediate, important feedback. But they insist taste is paramount.</p> \n<h2>5. Bacon naan, <a href=\"http://www.dishoom.com/\">Dishoom </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b697a68b737006eb3c201cc65c07e07ee668842a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858515916/97d655a3-3ab3-472d-bd50-5c9789680c54-460x353.jpeg\" alt=\"Bacon naan.\" width=\"460\" height=\"353\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bacon naan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This beauty more than deserves its online fame: a pillowy, gently charred bread stuffed with crisp bacon, cream cheese and tangy chilli-tomato jam. Some add an egg. (A fork piercing yolks in slow-motion is a meme: there are currently 63,307 Instagram post for #eggporn. Sigh.)</p> \n<h2>6. Duck and waffle, <a href=\"http://duckandwaffle.com/\">Duck &amp; Waffle </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3caa3bf3f149e00e3a65c19079e17149d88156e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858581182/3f34216b-67f2-4e76-8382-9a018d74b32b-460x418.jpeg\" alt=\"Duck and waffle\" width=\"460\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duck and waffle.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nothing ensures hero status so much as calling your whole restaurant after one dish. If diners at this City smash aren’t tweeting the view, they’re Instagramming the crisp, fluffy waffles, flanked with confit duck and fried duck egg, the whole to be drenched with mustard maple syrup. The restaurant goes through a reported 7,000 duck legs a month.</p> \n<h2>7. The dead hippy, <a href=\"http://meatliquor.com/\">MeatLiquor </a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73d550ee8c1add432be4f4fbae22af88023f78a5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858663845/5c6747cc-a0c0-45d9-a139-1a1915e3a627-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Dead Hippy burger\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dead Hippy burger.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: MeatLiquor/Instagram</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>From the early days of Yianni Papoutsis’s MeatWagon burger van in London pub car parks to ambitious worldwide burger domination with MeatLiquor, this is a tribute to – depending on who you believe – <a href=\"http://www.in-n-out.com/\">In-N-Out Burger</a>’s secret, off-menu “double double cheeseburger animal-style” or, more prosaically, the Big Mac. No looker – this brute is downright ugly – but wow, it does the job. One of the UK’s first cult burgers.</p> \n<h2>8. The parmo, <a href=\"http://www.solita.co.uk/\">Solita</a> </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b1cc6cef12686451b4e93155de8a400f339b853\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433858736154/244c5405-28a5-47a2-bd9b-2c7d17d05237-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Parmo\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parmo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A cult north-eastern booze partner (there is even a Teesside-based <a href=\"https://twitter.com/loveparmo\">@loveparmo</a> Twitter account), this bastardised, vaguely Italianate chicken item (parmo = parmesan, although it rarely features, making this the Asbo offspring of veal parmigiana) has reached new heights at Solita. Not given to restraint, their version is fried in parmesan-laced panko breadcrumbs, topped with bechamel and melted cheese, loaded with meatballs marinara and stuffed into a brioche bun. With chips.

Biting down into it, the roe exploded with a satisfying burst of flavour. Two bites and it was gone, but “it wakes up the palate and now you’re hungry”, said my now hungry companion. There’s a slight, delightful trickiness to it and the dish that followed. Was there someone in the kitchen with a syringe injecting the salmon roe into the small, perfectly spherical ball of salmon?</p> \n<p>And in the next course – a sashimi of yellowfin tuna, jam&oacute;n ib&eacute;rico cream avocado, baby radish, ponzu and pork crackling (minute sprinkles like divided snowflakes) – how the hell did the pinky-green cream end up as the filling in the tube of tuna?</p> \n<p>It’s worth marvelling at before consuming, because not only is the food beautifully presented but its construction is a work of art. </p> \n<p>And the wines were exquisitely chosen. The acidity of the 2013 Domaine Mittnacht Freres Gyotaku from Alsace cut through the fat of the cream. Our sommelier – like all the staff we dealt with – was knowledgable and slightly stiff. Which is good, and appropriate. In a place like this, you don’t want your waiters to crouch down, elbows on your table and say: “So have you dined with us before?”</p> \n<p>The next course – matched with a 2013 Jamsheed Roussanne from Beechworth –was tender and crunchy at the same time; the pine mushroom, fried potato, poached quail egg, caviar and roasted chicken powder like a delicious Sydney beachside breakfast in miniature. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e56b56b9f908c8f179f46b7d1745eeeedc52f9bf\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e56b56b9f908c8f179f46b7d1745eeeedc52f9bf/0_0_2105_2807/750.jpg\" alt=\"Pine mushroom, fried potato, poached quail egg, caviar, roasted chicken powder.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pine mushroom, fried potato, poached quail egg, caviar and roasted chicken powder.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is the kitchen playing with texture – as well as flavour. The potato was crispy and looked like a bird’s nest; the quail’s egg was soft and runny, the mushrooms were the most flavoursome I’ve had. Together they were interesting and full of flavour without being overwhelming. </p> \n<p>“It’s got grip and a savoury edge, it walks a wonderful tightrope,” said my friend. “And it’s so seasonal. You can only get this sort of dish in Sydney, at this time of the year.”<br />He also liked that the plate was warmed appropriately for the temperature of the dish.</p> \n<p>In between courses we were served a milky bun with butter, and then came our favourite wine of the evening, a ros&eacute; from Georgia, the 2013 Pheasant’s Tears.</p> \n<p>“It’s a phantom!” exclaimed my friend. “It’s there and it’s not. No smell, no taste, nothing.” He sniffed this mysterious ruby wine. “Slight nose ... it just falls of the edge of a cliff.”</p> \n<p>The wine was paired with a crab dish (with dashimaki tamago, egg rice, kabosu, blood plum, hijiki and wild wood sorrel) that was the most comfort-food-y dish on the menu – all the softness and flavour of a Japanese omelette, with the sharp tartness of the blood plum cutting through the egginess.</p> \n<p>Our last savoury dish was the most dramatic looking. The Wagyu sirloin was finely sliced and layered, with the dark sculpture of reshaped mushroom placed on the meat like a work of art. It threw shadows the shape of antlers across the plate. Food that looks like this is almost (but not quite) too good to eat. Thank God for Instagram which will allow the memory of the perishable to remain in perpetuity.</p> \n<p>Save room for dessert. We got the white chocolate egg which, when cracked, spills treats like a pi&ntilde;ata, popping candy the flavour of finger lime and the sharp acidity of sherbet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a32e5771cb4a6fa20293943b9199dc24dbef4e2e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a32e5771cb4a6fa20293943b9199dc24dbef4e2e/0_0_2232_2992/746.jpg\" alt=\"The autumn chocolate forest dessert.\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The autumn chocolate forest dessert.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“It’s a classic Spanish technique,” said my friend. “Very moulded shell, very molecular.”</p> \n<p>But not too molecular.

It was nature and a forest floor as reimagined and made edible with soft chocolate, hazelnut and almond, lavender and honey cream blackberry sorbet, blueberry and rosewater jellies, green tea, <strong>l</strong>iquorice, chocolate twigs and bronze fennel.</p> \n<p>Oh, maybe you don’t need to wait until your planning permit comes through from council to build a 30-storey residential tower or you wind up giving your evidence at Icac.

But the girls, who spend half their time in Paris where Darroze oversees her other restaurant, got stuck on a delayed Eurostar.</p> \n<p>Charlotte was convinced that the prize would be a bottle of champagne (the award was sponsored by Veuve Clicquot), so Darroze had to take a photo of the trophy on her phone and send it to her to prove otherwise.</p> \n<p>“They should have been there,” Darroze says now, back in professional mode and talking over the phone from her Paris restaurant with the sound of clattering dishes in the background. “I regret it. For me, it was really important and they wanted to see it. I think they realised it was something special.”</p> \n<p>At 48, Darroze is that rare thing: a mother and a female chef operating at the top of her game in an industry still overwhelmingly dominated by men. On the same evening that she won her prestigious award, the World’s 50 Best Restaurants, as compiled by trade publication <em>Restaurant</em> magazine from an academy of more than 1,000 members, was revealed. Of that list, fewer than 4% of the kitchens were run by women.</p> \n<p>“The fact is we’re a minority, I know that,” says Darroze phlegmatically. A diminutive, forthright woman with wavy blond hair and a ready smile, she could be easily underestimated. This would be a mistake. She was born and raised in south-west France, where her parents ran a restaurant, and she was taught to cook by her grandmothers. Her first experience of a professional kitchen was at the age of 23 when, after a business degree at university, she got a job at Alain Ducasse’s Louis XV restaurant in Monaco. At the time, Darroze was the only woman in the brigade. For several months, she was authorised only to wash the lettuce. She did so without complaint, asking questions and taking notes on what was going on around her whenever she could.</p> \n<p>Three years later, she returned to run her family restaurant. By 1999, she was opening her own place in Paris, winning her first Michelin star in 2001 and gaining a slew of high-profile admirers, including the former French president Jacques Chirac and the actress Salma Hayek.</p> \n<p>Despite her professional success, Darroze considers motherhood the most important role in her life. She always wanted to have children but never met “the right man” and so, at the age of 40, decided to take matters into her own hands and adopt a baby girl from Vietnam (she returned, two years later, for her younger daughter).</p> \n<p>“Before 40, I don’t think it would have been possible for a few reasons,” she says. “First, I didn’t have in place a team strong enough to support me. I had to trust my team and be able to delegate because I wanted to be a mother who could spend time with my children … Second, because I often start work at 8.30 and come back at 11.30 or midnight, sometimes only with one hour of pause, and normally I work at least five days a week – of course I need two nannies. So on the financial side, there is a lot, and before 40 I didn’t have enough money.”</p> \n<p>She says it was beyond her control whether she adopted a boy or a girl, but “I admit, I was really happy it was like that”.</p> \n<p>Are women put off a career as a chef because they cannot see a way of juggling work and children? “Yes, it’s happened a lot of times in my kitchen. [I’ve seen] so many young women in their late 20s and early 30s and I was sure they could be the next H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Darroze or Anne-Sophie Pic [Pic has won three Michelin stars for her restaurant in south-east France] and unfortunately they say, ‘No, I want to be a wife and have a baby.’ Unfortunately they couldn’t do both at this age. When you want to be a chef at this level, it’s tricky.”</p> \n<p>Darroze is clear-sighted about the fact there is very little to be done about this because restaurant hours are always going to be long and arduous. The only thing that can change is, she says, “a woman’s mindset and that’s really difficult because when you’re a mother, of course you want to spend time with your baby. That’s humanity. I think this problem will be around for ever. It’s a big conflict in the head. I used to say if I was in love with a man who wanted to have a baby and get married to me at 32, I’m not sure I’d be here.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"841452270060ed11d5d0d213377b06948c7e63f9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/6/1433600214062/171ea289-cef3-44bb-abbf-df56d83e0ed6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Darroze trained with Alain Ducasse at his Louis XV restaurant in Monaco; for months, she was only allowed to wash the lettuce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Darroze trained with Alain Ducasse at his Louis XV restaurant in Monaco; for months, she was only allowed to wash the lettuce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Hache/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s rare, I suggest, to hear a successful woman speak so openly about her desire to get married and settle down. “I am honest,” she says, and you can almost sense her shrugging her shoulders on the other end of the phone line.</p> \n<p>She is often asked what advice she would give wannabe female chefs and her response is always the same: “I say: ‘OK, be a woman. Never try to be a guy and you will be respected.’”</p> \n<p>Darroze insists she has never experienced sexism in her career, although she admits that some of her contemporaries have. But, as a rule, she is not much given to moaning. Her attitude has always been simply to get on with things and work hard. Ducasse once told her that, if she wanted to be a success, she should “notice everything. Don’t forget anything.”</p> \n<p>It is advice that has served her well. Darroze says she felt “big emotion” on receiving the award for the world’s best female chef. But isn’t it patronising to have a special prize just for women?</p> \n<p>“No. Like every minority, we have some special awards,” she replies. “On the contrary, I take that as an opportunity to speak about us [female chefs]. I take it as a good thing, as motivation to other women.”</p> \n<p>In her acceptance speech, Darroze made reference to the fact that, for the first time since her Paris restaurant opened in 1999, women now outnumber men in the kitchen. It was “not deliberate”, she says, but rather a function of the fact that there are far more female students at culinary school in France than male. As a result, she gets more women than men applying for jobs. “It’s not a personal choice – just a matter of fact and circumstance. It reflects what could happen in the future. It will be challenging because we [men and women] don’t have the same sensibility or reaction when it comes to cooking.”</p> \n<p>In what way?</p> \n<p>“Women are very instinctive, they listen to their emotions. The guys want to put something [on the plate] to show something. They think, at the beginning, of a technique they want to show, and then follow the story. We [women] think about emotion first and then put the technique on that after.</p> \n<p>“The two ways are very respectable and very different. There are some exceptions, of course. I know some male chefs who are very feminine and some female chefs who are very male.”</p> \n<p>But, generally speaking, does she think she would be able to tell whether a dish was cooked by a woman or a man in a blind tasting?</p> \n<p>“I think so,” she replies.</p> \n<p>I ask if she sees the same emotional attachment to food in her daughters, and she laughs. Both her children have a taste for spice and Charlotte was eating sushi with wasabi at the age of one.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know if it’s in their blood or DNA,” she says. “But they also like the things all kids love – the bolognese pasta, the chicken nuggets.” Darroze stops, then adds hurriedly: “Home-made ones, for sure.”</p> \n<p>Well, of course. When your mother is the world’s best female chef, it would be foolish not to make the most of it.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/5/1433527498181/H-l-ne-Darroze-in-her-Par-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hélène Darroze in her Paris restaurant, where women now outnumber men in the kitchen.

I usually pay something like &pound;6 for a salad at Pret, so I’m really happy.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"18c5574fda74af3caa63209ee85b703e16954f31\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433354810661/e9eb6a7a-cc3c-46a6-a444-787e460eeef3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Staff serve customers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Staff serve customers</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Aisha Gani for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kimberley Coke, who had found out about the cafe from colleagues, said she had initially harboured reservations about its prices. “I thought that the food would be small portions – which it is – but obviously you can get a variety of things.”</p> \n<p>“Competitors [sell lunch items] at &pound;3 or &pound;4 each, but if you also get a smoothie too it can set you back &pound;7,” Coke said. “I’m back from maternity leave, so I’m really counting the pennies”.<br /></p> \n<p>However, another customer said he had actually spent more on lunch than usual. </p> \n<p>Jim McCarthy, 25, said: “I thought it was really good – probably a bit healthier than I would normally have.

One small couscous pot, a single Mediterranean tuna mayo sandwich, a cup of fresh carrot juice and an orange and blueberry cake were all bought for &pound;4. </p> \n<p>The carrot juice, which was a vivid orange, was pleasantly sweet. The sandwich tasted fresh yet not filling enough for a petite journalist with a big appetite, the cake moist and every couscous grain – packed with flavour – was scraped from the pot. </p> \n<p>Yet still feeling a bit peckish, perhaps an additional pot of Thai noodles would have been sufficient. </p> \n<p>While some cafes recently cropping up in London’s more gentrified areas – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2014/dec/13/cereal-killer-breakfast-east-london-channel-4-row\">most notably the Cereal Killer Caf&eacute; in Shoreditch </a>– have been criticised for being too expensive, Joe Kaye, 31, the cafe’s owner, said: “I feel people are forced to pay a higher price.
