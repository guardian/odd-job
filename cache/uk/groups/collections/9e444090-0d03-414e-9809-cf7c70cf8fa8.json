Foran was clearly left stunned that Parramatta sought to change the terms of his $4.8 million contract, one that was touted as a new beginning for an Eels side that has been embarassed by recruitment gaffe after recruitment gaffe over the last decade.</p> \n<p>The talented international now considers himself a free agent with the Eels attempting to register two different contracts with the NRL, a mess that could only happen at Parramatta. The Eels are desperately hoping that Foran will work his way through the issues and stick with Parramatta in 2016 but he is long odds now with the Sydney Roosters and Manly the two most likely clubs to win his signature next year.</p> \n<p>A resillient player, Foran won’t let any of this distract him from the prospect of a South Sydney upset on Friday night. The same is unlikely to be true for Parramatta on Saturday though when they take on the Dragons with a sense of “here we go again” a very real chance to leave the club as flat as a board and ready to be picked off.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomkins too good</strong></h2> \n<p>The New Zealand Warriors may still be feeling all warm and gooey about signing boom fullback Roger Tuivasa-Sheck next year but they should not undersell the impact Sam Tomkins has had on them this year. Though he has been limited to just four games through injury, the Warriors have not lost with the English superstar at the back. He has three assists to his name and gives the Warriors a north-south look in attack that they sorely miss without him.</p> \n<p>He will play his fifth game of 2015 against the Raiders on Saturday afternoon and it will be close to as fit as he has been all year. Tomkins has been maligned during his time at the Warriors but if the club has finals aspirations this year they need their sublime custodian fit and firing.</p> \n<h2><strong>No Thurston, no good</strong></h2> \n<p>The North Queensland Cowboys are looking to extend their club record winning streak to 12 this weekend – which would put them in a tie for the 13<sup>th</sup> longest winning streak in premiership history – but they must do so without superstar half Johnathan Thurston. The three-time Dally M Player of the Year and the short-priced favourite for the 2015 gong – will be rested after a tough season and long Origin campaign.</p> \n<p>The Cowboys have won just two of their last nine without Thurston in the side, a figure that would surprise few considering the dominant role he plays. It leaves the pressure of the streak’s continuation in the hands of props Matt Scott and James Tamou and rising half Michael Morgan.</p> \n<p>Incredibly, seven of the Cowboys’ last eight wins have come by single digits. The failure to put teams away will certainly give Cronulla plenty of confidence heading into the match, a confidence that will no doubt be boosted by an impressive showing during their last trip to Townsville when they went down by a single point despite North Queensland going in the shortest priced favourites in NRL history. </p> \n<h2><strong>Don’t forget Roberts</strong></h2> \n<p>Speculation is rife in rugby league circles that Rooster Blake Ferguson will be parachuted into the NSW team, Will Hopoate the man likely to make way. It seems that his opposite centre on Sunday – Gold Coast’s James Roberts – has been forgotten. Unquestionably the form centre of the premiership over the first half of the season, Roberts seems to have been leapfrogged by Ferguson in Blues consideration. Up against Ferguson and Game II man-of-the-match Michael Jennings, the Titans speedster will get one last chance to impress on Sunday afternoon on what will be an incredibly fast track in Gosford.</p> \n<h2><strong>Back to Belmore</strong></h2> \n<p>There will be plenty of emotion among the Canterbury faithful on Monday night with the Bulldogs returning to Belmore Sports Ground for a premiership match for the first time since 1998. The Bulldogs will be expecting a monstrous crowd against the Storm – ironically the last team Canterbury met at their traditional home ground back in 1998 where a sliding Craig Polla-Mounter try in torrential conditions made the difference.</p> \n<p>The NSW Government and the NRL can try to push a cookie-cutter stadiums approach that squeezes all games towards the big grounds but one of the major advantages the NRL has is the ability to still host matches at suburban venues. A horses-for-courses approach is needed. Big games need to be played at big grounds. But when a matchup is unlikely to draw, clubs should be able to leverage the charm, quaintness and history of suburban footy grounds. The Bulldogs have done that for this Storm clash on Monday and will hopefully continue to use Belmore when a sub-par crowd is forecast for ANZ.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/18f650dc3422443532f6f2431a3cc7825e21fb71/0_60_2678_1607/2678.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1607,"width":2678,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dan Himbrechts/AAP","altText":"Kieran Foran has been the subject of much attention this past week.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dan Himbrechts/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T21:45:02Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T21:45:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":20,"contributors":[{"name":"Nick Tedeschi","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/30/1412091784698/Nick-Tedeschi-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/nick-tedeschi"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["NRL","Australia sport","Rugby league","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/nrl","webTitle":"NRL"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/rugbyleague","webTitle":"Rugby league"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Nick Tedeschi","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/nick-tedeschi"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/26/nrl-what-to-look-out-for-in-round-16","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a56a","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jun/26/nrl-what-to-look-out-for-in-round-16","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/26/nrl-what-to-look-out-for-in-round-16"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/18f650dc3422443532f6f2431a3cc7825e21fb71/0_60_2678_1607/2678.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1607,"width":2678,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kieran Foran has been the subject of much attention this past week.

working again in any other sport that is a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) code.</p> \n<p>Dank, who chose not to be represented at the hearing and can contest the verdict at an AFL

in April was found guilty on 10 counts of breaching the AFL’s anti-doping code, including charges of trafficking and attempted trafficking of, and complicity in, matters related to prohibited substances.</p> \n<p>He was cleared of the more serious charges of the administration or attempted administration of Thymosin Beta 4 to 34 current and former Bombers players.</p> \n<p>Those players were cleared of any wrongdoing by the tribunal in March but earlier this month Wada announced it would appeal against the not-guilty verdicts. </p> \n<p>Wada is currently building its case, which it will take to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and the two-year saga is showing no sign of reaching an imminent conclusion.</p> \n<p>The AFL was expected to make comment on the latest findings later

The decision resulted in the Italian team Luna Rossa withdrawing from the America’s Cup and Team New Zealand’s chief executive accused the remaining four crews of “self-serving manoeuvring”.</p> \n<p>Ainslie, who won the 2013 America’s Cup in remarkable circumstances against the New Zealanders with Team Oracle USA, is fronting a new British team for the 2017 competition and on Wednesday announced a new partnership with Land Rover. Ainslie’s team was renamed Land Rover BAR at their new multimillion pound base in Portsmouth that became operational this week.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/02/americas-cup-luna-rossa-pull-out\">Luna Rossa pull out of America’s Cup in protest over reduced boat size</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of the row regarding boat size for 2017, Ainslie said: “It was regrettable that Luna Rossa decided to withdraw from the cup – Team New Zealand have been having a pretty tumultuous time of late and I think there is a lot more going on within that team other than just the issues around the class rule.</p> \n<p>“Now we have teams committed to moving forward in this exciting new class of boat, sharing a common goal. Team New Zealand, like ourselves, are heavily reliant on commercial funding. I’ll be hugely surprised that as a commercial team they could suddenly decide to not compete. I’m confident they will be there and be a strong challenger like they have been in the past.</p> \n<p>“We supported the shift to smaller boats for two reasons. Firstly, the longer-term vision from all the teams was to have continuity in the circuit, that we could collectively design a boat for the next America’s Cup and use the same one beyond. The other side was to reduce the costs; this new class of boat is containerised so the logistics of getting it around the world are more achievable.”</p> \n<p>Land Rover, the British automotive manufacturer, becomes a central part of Ainslie’s technical innovation group. It is the latest move by the four-times Olympic sailing champion to cement links with the motor industry, having already recruited Adrian Newey – Formula One’s most decorated designer – and Martin Whitmarsh, the former McLaren team principal who became BAR’s chief executive in March.</p> \n<p>Next month the America’s Cup World Series event takes place in Portsmouth, a qualification race for the 35th America’s Cup in Bermuda. More than 90,000 tickets have already been sold for the four days.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/24/1435148012272/Ben-Ainslie-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ben Ainslie's team supported the shift to smaller boats for the America's Cup.
