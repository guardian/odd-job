Hughes, at 6ft 3in, is a similar build and he also clearly shares the Jamaican’s relaxed demeanour.</p> \n<p>He said that latter trait is not picked up from the six-time Olympic champion, though. It is all him.</p> \n<p>“I just try to stay relaxed, that’s all,” he said. “I don’t try to mimic anyone because it’s best to be yourself. I’ll just be me.”</p> \n<p>With Adam Gemili missing with a hamstring injury, James Ellington was the second fastest qualifier and welcomed the increased competition provided by Hughes.</p> \n<p>“He’s got every right to run for Great Britain, so good luck to him,” Ellington told Press Association Sport.</p> \n<p>“I need to have a bit of pressure put on me to rise to the occasion. If he wasn’t here it would have been one of the easiest trials in the world, only probably two or three people contending, so it throws an oddball in the mix.”</p> \n<p>The action proper gets under way on Saturday when the highlights include Jessica Ennis-Hill and Katarina Johnson-Thompson in the 100m hurdles.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435955629887/Zharnel-Hughes--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Zharnel Hughes celebrates winning his 200m heat at the British Championships.

Throw in the news that Leeds have tied the full-back Zak Hardaker to a long-term deal as well and their futurelooks as bright as their present.</p> \n<p>That mix of youth and experience is one factor that, at the moment, is setting Leeds apart from the rest of Super League. They have had their obligatory mid-season blip yet are still three points clear at the top of the table after this latest win which featured rugby ranging from the sublime to the ridiculous – the latter of which came mostly from the defending champions as opposed to Leeds.</p> \n<p>Ominously for the rest of the league, Leeds are still not at the top of their game. Perennially they are a team who have learned to peak at the right time of the season and the fact that they are in top spot at a time of the year that is usually a lull for them is a firm warning that right now Leeds appear overwhelming favourites for Grand Final glory come October.</p> \n<p>“I felt we were clinical when we had the chances to score early on but I’m keen to mention that we weren’t brilliant in that first half despite scoring 22 points,” said the Leeds coach, Brian McDermott. “I don’t want to dumb it down too much but it was a decent contest and we simply nailed our chances early.”</p> \n<p>An error-strewn first 40 minutes from the Saints was more than enough to put the game out of their reach; trailing 22-0 at the break they never really posed a serious comeback at any point, which left their coach, Keiron Cunningham, apologising to the fans who made the trip along the M62 to watch their team get completely outclassed. Injuries and fatigue caught up with St Helens on the night – but that situation will be eased somewhat in the next week with the impending arrival of the Australian full-back Adam Quinlan.</p> \n<p>“By the time we got some sort of foothold in the game we were 22 points down,” said Cunningham. “It’s not good enough for this club; they’re not playing for an average club – we like to think of ourselves as world-class and it’s not good enough. A lot of senior players let their teammates down today.”</p> \n<p>The opening half was appalling from St Helens but they had arguably played themselves out of the contest by the end of the opening quarter. By that point they were 16-0 down after tries from Kallum Watkins, Kylie Leuluai and Ryan Hall – all of which came from errors by the Saints. Only handling errors prevented Leeds from extending the lead further but they would get a fourth try just before half-time when Handley crossed for his first.</p> \n<p>Quite what Cunningham could have said after those first 40 minutes is anyone’s guess but it had some effect. Within two minutes of the restart Matty Fleming touched down a Travis Burns kick.</p> \n<p>That try, and the half-time break, had temporarily prompted a shift in momentum and, when Hardaker was sent to the sin-bin for a dangerous tackle on Travis Burns, Leeds’ first-half work was threatening to come undone. However, they shrugged off the numerical disadvantage to reassert control of the game with a try from Carl Ablett and a second for Handley and all but seal the result with well over 20 minutes remaining.</p> \n<p>St Helens at least produced some sort of improvement in the second half but tries from Jordan Turner and Kyle Amor were nothing more than scant consolation after they left themselves with too much do. That point was emphatically proved as the game entered its final 10 minutes, as first Handley finished another sweeping move to complete his hat-trick, then Hall added his second.</p> \n<p><strong>Leeds</strong> Hardaker; Handley, Watkins, Moon, Hall; Sinfield, McGuire; Leuluai, Aiton, Peacock, Keinhorst, Ward, Ablett.</p> \n<p><strong>Interchange</strong> Burrow, Delaney, Cuthbertson, Garbutt.</p> \n<p><strong>Tries</strong> Watkins, Leuluai, Hall 2, Handley 3, Ablett <strong>Goals</strong> Sinfield 7 <strong>Sin Bin</strong> Hardaker (50)</p> \n<p><strong>St Helens</strong> Percival; Dawson, Fleming, Turner, Swift; Burns, Walsh; Amor, Roby, Masoe, Wilkin, Greenwood, Jones. <strong>Interchange</strong> Walmsley, Flanagan, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Savelio. <strong>Tries</strong> Jones, Turner, Amor <strong>Goals</strong> Percival 3 <strong>Referee</strong> R Silverwood</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435957522757/Kallum-Watkins-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kallum Watkins celebrates scoring Leeds Rhinos' first try in their comfortable win over top of the table rivals St Helens.

Denying British women the opportunity to play in it at such a crucial time for the sport’s development is looking more and more myopic with each passing day.</p> \n<p>Is the women’s game in the UK so well developed, so strong at the grassroots, so popular with fans, so embedded in schools, that it can afford to pass up the chance of one of the greatest shop windows it will ever have? Of course not. On the contrary, it is at a crucial phase in its development.</p> \n<p>To pass on the opportunity to play in Brazil – the home of the beautiful game, in a country where women’s football is taken seriously, in front of passionate crowds, as part of a British Olympic team, with all that entails – starts to feel like an act of vandalism.</p> \n<p>The arguments around a men’s team – as played out in the runup to London 2012 – are different and more contentious. For many reasons, from fixture congestion to the conflicted feelings of some fans, there are as many arguments against as for. That is just not the case when it comes to the women’s game, where it is virtually impossible to find anyone who is against the idea on principle.</p> \n<p>The reason we have ended up here is because of, as so often, the shortsighted and internecine nature of football politics and power games as played out by grey men in grey suits. The English FA was keen to put a team forward forboth the women’s and men’s competitions. With various levels of vigour, the idea was rejected by the other home nations who continue to maintain that to play in a joint team at the Olympics could, over time, undermine the sovereignty of the individual bodies.</p> \n<p>If there was to be no men’s team on principle, they railed, there could be no women’s side either. As it turned out, the men would not have qualified anyway because of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">the limp performance</a> of Gareth Southgate’s England Under-21 side in the Czech Republic.</p> \n<p>Obviously, it is hard to take much of what Fifa says seriously but, for what it’s worth, there have been repeated assurances from Zurich, both verbal and written, that playing a British side in the Olympics would not undermine the case for separate national teams elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Sometimes another rationale is put forward, that it would threaten the “special privileges” enjoyed by the home nations at Fifa – a guaranteed seat on the executive committee and a place on the Ifab board that codifies the laws of the game.</p> \n<p>Those privileges are being steadily whittled away in any case and should arguably be voluntarily surrendered if we are to take the moral high ground in the debate on Fifa reform.</p> \n<p>It is hard not to conclude that the most vociferous reaction, from the Football Association of Wales chairman, Trefor Lloyd-Hughes, was not somehow bound up in his personal disappointment at being passed over for the Fifa executive committee <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/24/david-gill-fifa-vice-president\" title=\"\">in favour of the English FA’s favoured candidate, David Gill</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/england-japan-postgame-coach-comments\">Laura Bassett is in a hard place right now … but she's a hero, says Lionesses coach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Under the previous Buggins’ turn formula it would have been time for a Welsh representative but under a new system in which Uefa votes on which candidate should take the seat Gill jumped the queue – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-fa-david-gill-resigned-fifa\" title=\"\">only to resign anyway when Blatter was re-elected</a>.</p> \n<p>Lloyd-Hughes, a retired ambulance driver from Anglesey, was furious at what he saw as English arrogance and was “livid” when he heard about the Team GB plans. Some of the resentment felt by the FAs in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland towards England is justified. There can be a tendency towards loftily deciding what is right for all four.</p> \n<p>However, to let such petty politicking and confusing internal rows get in the way of the development of a sport that should be at the forefront of faltering efforts to deliver a legacy from the London Olympics, and the thorny issue of engaging teenage girls in sport, is appalling. Surely the obvious compromise was to enter a women’s side and leave the more contentious issue of the men for another day?</p> \n<p>Not only will Sampson’s side be denied the opportunity to build on their momentum in Rio, for the handful of players from the other home nations who would have been in contention for a place in the squad the chance to play in an Olympics on the world stage is gone – probably for good.</p> \n<p>The Women’s Super League is now well established but has been a slow burn in terms of building attendances. Yet healthy audiences for England’s World Cup matches on the BBC, despite the time difference, have shown the appetite is there on the big occasion. To willingly turn down the opportunity to capitalise on that next summer and aim for Olympic gold is a decision that can only have the rest of the world shaking their heads and wondering, not for the first time, at the ways of our funny little island.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/2/1435836935897/Englands-progress-to-the--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's progress to the World Cup semi-finals underlined there is the appetite for the women's game on the big occasions.
