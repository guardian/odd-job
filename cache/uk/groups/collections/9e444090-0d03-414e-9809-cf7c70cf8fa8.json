It will be amazing to put on another great show for them under the floodlights on the Friday night.”</p> \n<p>Bolt will run on the Friday night of the three-day meeting which runs from 24-26 July. Earlier this week Mo Farah also confirmed that he would run in the 3,000m on the Friday. Greg Rutherford and Jessica Ennis-Hill are among the athletes who will compete on the Saturday afternoon, while the Sunday will be devoted to Paralympic athletes.</p> \n<p>Bolt’s late decision to run in London was made only after George Osborne granted a tax exemption to foreign athletes competing at the event in the budget earlier this week. Usually they are liable for 50% tax on their appearance fee, plus a proportion of their worldwide earnings.</p> \n<p>It was for this reason that Bolt did not compete in London in 2010 or 2011, or the Diamond League meeting in Glasgow last year. However he did run in the first Anniversary Games in London in 2013 – where a similar tax break was granted – winning the 100m in 9.85sec.</p> \n<p>The Jamaican has struggled for fitness since 2013, and after missing much of last year, has raced only a handful of times this season. But while Bolt’s fastest 100m time of 10.12 sec this year puts him just 58th in the world ranking, while his 200m best of 20.13 puts him 13th in the standings, it is worth bearing in mind that the 29-year-old has raced the 200m in atrocious weather conditions in Ostrava and in New York, while his 100m race in Rio was only an early season tune up. Those close to him believe he is in condition to go much, much quicker.</p> \n<p>Given that the world championships start at the end of August, the Anniversary Games will be a crucial test of his form and his readiness to face the controversial American sprinter Justin Gatlin, who has not been beaten since 2013.</p> \n<p>Bolt’s decision was greeted with delight by Boris Johnson, who hailed it as the beginning of a new chapter for the Olympic Stadium.</p> \n<p>“The opening night of the Anniversary Games has attracted the strongest field ever assembled for a single night of athletics, providing Londoners with another ‘I was there’ moment,” the mayor of London said. “The chance to see a living legend like Bolt is very rare and we are delighted to be able to welcome him to the reopening of the stadium where he so thrilled us all at the 2012 Games.</p> \n<p>“It is a beginning of a new chapter for the stadium and there will be many more amazing nights to come – it is wonderful that we are starting in such style.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436518651216/Usain-Bolt-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Usain Bolt celebrates winning the men's 100m final at the London 2012 Olympics.

leaders, Leeds, with two games left before the Super 8s","standFirst":"<span class=\"bullet\">•</span> St Helens 35-34 Huddersfield","byline":"Press Association","body":"<p>The Australian Adam Quinlan scored a hat-trick of tries on a dream Super League debut as St Helens secured a precious 35-34 win over Huddersfield to move to within a point of the leaders, Leeds, with two games left before the Super 8s.</p> \n<p>Saints were never behind but Huddersfield hit back five times to level the scores and the half-backs Danny Brough and Jamie Ellis both failed with kicks at goal in the last 10 minutes that would have put them in front before the scrum-half, Luke Walsh, finally settled it with a last-gasp drop-goal.</p> \n<p>Defences were all at sea throughout the 12-try thriller but the St Helens coach, Keiron Cunningham, will be delighted to get the win, especially after describing last week’s 46-18 defeat at Leeds as a “debacle”.</p> \n<p>Quinlan became the seventh St Helens player to take on the full-back role in 2015, four days after arriving from Australia, and he could hardly have made a more memorable start to his Super League career.</p> \n<p>He was tested out early with a couple of bombs from Brough but came through with flying colours and pulled off a crucial tackle on his opposite number, Scott Grix, before demonstrating his penchant for scoring tries.</p> \n<p>He was on the spot on 15 minutes to collect a lucky ricochet after James Roby’s kick came back off Grix and was also in the right place to touch down Andre Savelio’s sloppy offload on the half-hour, although Saints’ determination to keep the ball alive deserved some reward.</p> \n<p>Quinlan then demonstrated his alertness to support a break by Roby to complete his hat-trick four minutes before half-time.</p> \n<p>Walsh kicked all three conversions but there were never more than six points between the teams in the first half as Huddersfield attacked with venom.</p> \n<p>The Giants, in fact, could have been 18-0 up before Quinlan’s first score but for some careless finishing.</p> \n<p>The second-rows Jack Hughes and Joe Wardle both broke through the Saints first line of defence with alarming ease, only to see their runs come to nothing, and the winger Jermaine McGillvary had an early try disallowed by the video referee, Richard Silverwood, for putting a foot in touch.</p> \n<p>However, Silverwood over-ruled match referee Ben Thaler’s decision to disallow a try from Hughes, who stretched out of a two-man tackle to plant the ball on the line, and McGillvary finally got his reward when he collected Grix’s kick to touch down at the corner.</p> \n<p>Trailing 18-12 at the break, the visitors hit back to level the scores for a third time within five minutes of the restart when Hughes’ offload created the space for the centre Leroy Cudjoe to cross out wide, although not so far out that Ellis could not kick his third conversion.</p> \n<p>The arrival of Quinlan enabled Mark Percival to revert to his customary position at centre and he showed his danger by weaving his way through the Giants defence for his side’s fourth try but again Huddersfield hit back.</p> \n<p>The prop Craig Kopczak and replacement hooker Kyle Wood were both held up over the line but the pressure told when Grix’s long pass got McGillvary over for his second try.</p> \n<p>That made it 24-24, but the champions looked to have established a grip on the game at last when Roby’s short ball got the second-row Joe Greenwood lunging for the line and five minutes later Percival juggled with Walsh’s pass before scoring his second try.</p> \n<p>Walsh was off target for the first time, but Saints were two scores in front for the first time at 34-24.</p> \n<p>However, there was still time for a couple more twists, with Eorl Crabtree taking a pass from his fellow front-row, Craig Huby, to crash over and the centre Aaron Murphy forcing his way over out wide for Huddersfield’s sixth try on 71 minutes.</p> \n<p>Ellis had the chance to put the Giants in front for the first time but he was wide with his sixth conversion attempt and Brough, the team’s normal marksman, then failed with an ambitious penalty attempt from halfway after Percival’s restart went out on the full.</p> \n<p>It was left to Walsh to determine the outcome with a snap drop-goal two minutes from the end of a pulsating encounter.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436564316300/St-Helens-Adam-Quinlan--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"St

And so it proved again in Massachusetts, at least before a tiring Haiti team began to allow the US more opportunities in the second half.</p> \n<p>Klinsmann had introduced wholesale changes to face the Haitians. DeAndre Yedlin and Gyasi Zardes had raised some concerns with their reluctance to pinch in and support Kyle Beckerman and Michael Bradley in the midfield diamond against Honduras and neither young player started on Friday night.</p> \n<p>Instead, the relative experience of Graham Zusi and Mix Diskerud replaced Yedlin and Zardes, while Bradley dropped to the holding role, and Clint Dempsey was pushed back behind a front two of Aron J&oacute;hannsson and Jozy Altidore.</p> \n<p>Klinsmann also gave Greg Garza his first competitive start after a series of friendly appearances, to tie his international future to the US. No John Brooks either, with Tim Ream of Bolton starting alongside Omar Gonzalez and Brad Evans of Seattle starting as right back.</p> \n<p>If the selection was meant to generate a sharper start than in the opening game, the results were indifferent, although the US were not helped by the surface at Gillette Stadium, where the temporary grass surface had been badly chewed up by the cleats of Honduras and Panama players in the 1-1 draw that was the opening part of the evening’s double-header. That result meant a US victory would see them win the group, but the assistance they’d received from the result came at the expense of the turf.</p> \n<p>The ground staff had duly watered the grass heavily before kick off and the ball was moving around quickly in the opening exchanges. Moving quickly, though not with much intent, in the opening stages. Haiti played as advertised, by digging in and looking for sudden counters, while the US could not find any sort of rhythm to try and pass through them.</p> \n<p>And the first chance, when it came, was to Haiti. Diskerud was robbed in the center circle and in racing back to try and retrieve the situation only succeeded in giving up a free kick centrally 25 yards out. Mechack Jerome stepped up and hit a sweetly dipping and curling free kick off the top corner of Brad Guzan’s goal frame, with the goalkeeper well beaten.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t an aberration either — loose midfield touches by the US repeatedly became the catalysts for Haiti attacks in the first half, while the USA struggled to trouble Johnny Placide’s goal.</p> \n<p>In the 21st minute Wilde-Donald Guerrier had another chance to give Haiti the lead as he arrived on the overlap on the right only to send his shot past Guzan but past the far post as well. The lively Guerrier would torment Garza down the right flank as the half went on, but in truth the entire US backline looked shaky as they struggled to familiarize themselves with each other while dealing with blue shirts regularly running at them at speed.</p> \n<p>The US did have the ball in the net first, on a rare break of their own in the 35th minute, but Johannsson’s turn and shot was ruled offside after Altidore elected to slip a pass to him rather than take the shot from an angle himself. On the sideline Klinsmann looked incensed by the decision, and replays showed he had a point, though maybe he was just as angry at the general sloppiness from his own team thus far, and despite an increase in passing tempo from his team in the remainder of the half, there wasn’t a lot more to encourage him in that period.</p> \n<p>With the need to force the pace and stretch Haiti apparent, Altidore made way for Zardes, and the rewards were instant. The young LA Galaxy player got behind the defense in the 47th minute to cut the ball back low for the late-arriving Dempsey to emphatically sidefoot his third goal of the tournament from just inside the box.</p> \n<p>Haiti were looking more stretched now, though despite more encouraging build up play the US were still prone to passing moves breaking down, and Guzan had to thwart a one-on-one chance for Duckens Nazon, after Haiti broke from a poor pass by Bradley.</p> \n<p>Guerrier too, continued to ask awkward questions as Haiti’s most threatening attacker, and in the 63rd minute he got across Garza on the edge of the six-yard box to flash a header wide from a whipped cross by Kim Jaggy. After a testing night, Garza made way for Fabian Johnson moments later.</p> \n<p>Yet if Haiti were expected to wilt, instead the US found themselves in a battle for the remainder of the game, as Haiti continued to look for openings right up to the final whistle. At the other end Zardes showed glimpses of stretching the Haiti defense into trouble again, and did his personal case for playing time no harm, but in truth, the final score was about the best case scenario for the USA after another awkward night.</p> \n<p>At least the US don’t need a result against Panama to win the group now, but Klinsmann will be worried about the general sloppiness as sterner tests arrive in the knockout rounds.

But ‘personality’ – that is, being a genuine jerk – does not make for great tennis</p>","byline":"Geoff Dyer","body":"<p>Wimbledon came under some slight pressure this year. Nothing too severe: the equivalent not of a broken serve but something in the region of 0-30 at 4-all in the first set. It started perfectly, as Wimbledon always does, with the champion back on Centre Court to suggest an unbroken continuity from the previous year, with no intervening tournaments in other countries, so that&nbsp;history becomes a seamless vista of&nbsp;Wimbledons stretching back to Magna Carta.</p> \n<p>The rumbles of discontent, when they first became manifest, were also a kind of throwback – to the 1970s. Back then Wimbledon felt like – in fact prided itself on being – a leftover from some <em>ancien regime, </em>with the players toiling and serfing on the lawns of a feudal estate. As an adolescent I naturally took the side of the rebels, whose yells challenged the assumption of unquestionable parental authority. The all-white clothing rule seemed ludicrous, as oppressive as the obligation to wear school uniform instead of loon pants. The players pushed things as far as they could and then, gradually, everyone came to their senses and realised that the sight of entirely white clothing against the blazing green of grass was not just one of the great aesthetic pleasures of sport, but a principle as worthy of defence as the right to remain silent during rallies.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/bethanie-mattek-sands-criticises-wimbledons-excessive-clothing-rule\">Bethanie Mattek-Sands criticises Wimbledon's 'excessive' clothing rule</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This year, however, the all-white policy was felt to have verged on the inquisitorial as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/bethanie-mattek-sands-criticises-wimbledons-excessive-clothing-rule\" title=\"\">it ruled on bra straps and&nbsp;visible underwear</a>. But consider the vestimentary free-for-all of the other Slams. Of course it was fun that Stan Wawrinka won the French in his plaid shorts, looking like he was on a beach holiday in Florida. But the rest of&nbsp;them, men and women alike, formed a&nbsp;rainbow coalition of ageing candy ravers. Despite the riot of colour, these&nbsp;flourescent outfits did not seem like expressions of individual taste or will. It&nbsp;was more like a fiercely competitive display of the new season’s styles being pimped by Nike.</p> \n<p>The matter of clothing is closely related to another of Wimbledon’s quiet&nbsp;triumphs: the almost total lack of corporate graffiti in the form of logos and advertising. In fact, the only major stylistic blemish at Wimbledon continues to be the uniforms of the line judges. Designed by Ralph Lauren – when the commission should, as a&nbsp;matter of principle, have gone to Paul&nbsp;Smith or some other Anglo – these&nbsp;outfits are not just inappropriate. It’s even possible that the Scott-Fitzgeraldish, jazz-age caps worn by the male judges combined with the atmosphere of strawberries-and-Pimm’s affluence to encourage the BBC to lodge Wimbledon 2day in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/04/bbc-wimbledon-2day-clare-balding-gatsby-club\" title=\"\">the ill-fated “Gatsby Bar”</a>, where the nightly highlights show was rebooted as a sub-genre of light entertainment. Where the&nbsp;authorities at Wimbledon are to be congratulated on holding out on the white-clothes-only rule, the BBC is to be gently applauded for capitulating to the court of viewer opinion. Paradoxically, the things we mainly objected to – a chorus of the public lurking moronically in the background – became the steadily less visible representatives of a mounting clamour for their dismissal. From centre stage they were shunted first to a more discreet position, before becoming thoroughly marginalised, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/06/wimbledon-2day-bbc-admits-defeat-over-format\" title=\"\">and eventually expelled</a>, allowing us to focus once again on the action, the players.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/06/wimbledon-2day-bbc-admits-defeat-over-format\">Wimbledon 2Day: BBC admits defeat over format</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Looking at players’ arms, at the lack of full-sleeve, snake-skin tatts that are part of the modern footballer’s muscular armature, it’s tempting to conclude that&nbsp;the single best thing about tennis players is that they’re not footballers. Which brings us to the other big rumpus of the week, caused by the new old bore on the block, Nick Kyrgios – old because his antics are also a throwback to the 1970s, to the behaviour that posed a&nbsp;justified threat to institutional sleepiness. The gap between players and&nbsp;officials – who expected the kind of deference paid to magistrates while not always paying close attention to the lines – became a chasm that proved the&nbsp;opposite of yawning.</p> \n<p>John McEnroe had a point to make, even if it was deducted. More recently, <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/10/27/color-codes\" title=\"\">as Claudia Rankine subtly argues</a> in her essay-poem collection Citizen, many little incidents led to Serena Williams threatening “to shove the fucking ball down [a line judge’s] fucking throat” at&nbsp;the US Open in 2009. Kyrgios had no&nbsp;such defence – at least not until the retired Australian swimmer Dawn Fraser foolishly served up a retrospective, cause-generating effect by telling him to&nbsp;“<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/dawn-fraser-sorry-for-racist-outburst-on-nick-kyrgios-and-bernard-tomic\" title=\"\">go back where [your parents] came from</a>”. So it was pretty lame to hear McEnroe talking about him fondly as a&nbsp;“personality”. Martin Amis famously <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/personality-anyone\" title=\"\">saw off the cult of personality in tennis</a> when he defined it as “an exact synonym of&nbsp;a seven-letter duosyllable starting with ‘a’, ending with&nbsp;‘e’ (and also featuring, in order of appearance, an ‘ss’, an ‘h’, an ‘o’ and ‘l’)”. Some people find Kyrgios entertaining in a field where other players are boring or robotic. The mistake here is to elide styles of play that are boring (Ivan Lendl then, Milos Raonic now) with personal qualities that might be boring, but have nothing to do with tennis. The determined suppression of manifest emotion adds to the manifest drama of high-quality tennis which, unless I’m tuned to the wrong channel, is what we all want to see.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/dawn-fraser-sorry-for-racist-outburst-on-nick-kyrgios-and-bernard-tomic\">Dawn Fraser sorry for 'racist' outburst on Nick Kyrgios and Bernard Tomic</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As Amis goes on to say, players such as Arthur Ashe didn’t need personality because they had <em>character</em>. One of the invigorating pleasures of tennis in the last decade has been the way that athletes who have invested their entire being in a game are able to accept defeat with good grace. That’s why Djokovic got a five-minute standing ovation before Wawrinka could receive his trophy at&nbsp;the French. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/novak-djokovic-sorry-ball-girl-wimbledon-2015-tennis\" title=\"\">His yelling at a ball girl this week</a> seemed unpleasantly out of character; the subsequent apology was anything but. (Incidentally, has he always had those Nosferatu ears? If so, how come they’ve escaped our notice till now?) We’ve been blessed with an era in which the players are not just great but gracious, not just gracious but – Murray excepted – charming, too. At times the imperious or Ozymandias side of Federer’s character – the “frown” and “sneer of cold command” – has been unmistakable, but in the blazing twilight of his career, he has been consistently magnanimous.</p> \n<p>To his credit Kyrgios comes across as&nbsp;genuine – a genuine jerk. But the suspicion lurks that, just as McEnroe seems to have been contractually obliged to have an outburst or two on the veterans’ tour, so the youthful Kyrgios could easily be groomed for a&nbsp;perceived yob-shaped hole in the branding market. If it was good to see the back of him – to be treated, instead, to Wawrinka and Richard Gasquet going gorgeously at it in the quarters – it’s a slight shame that we still get to see so much of the front of Boris Becker. On the evidence of this tournament, his coaching signals to Djokovic – another slight controversy – amount to no more than, “I am turning into a human sausage, please prick me.”</p> \n<p><em>Geoff Dyer’s new book Where Do We Come From?

Denying British women the opportunity to play in it at such a crucial time for the sport’s development is looking more and more myopic with each passing day.</p> \n<p>Is the women’s game in the UK so well developed, so strong at the grassroots, so popular with fans, so embedded in schools, that it can afford to pass up the chance of one of the greatest shop windows it will ever have? Of course not. On the contrary, it is at a crucial phase in its development.</p> \n<p>To pass on the opportunity to play in Brazil – the home of the beautiful game, in a country where women’s football is taken seriously, in front of passionate crowds, as part of a British Olympic team, with all that entails – starts to feel like an act of vandalism.</p> \n<p>The arguments around a men’s team – as played out in the runup to London 2012 – are different and more contentious. For many reasons, from fixture congestion to the conflicted feelings of some fans, there are as many arguments against as for. That is just not the case when it comes to the women’s game, where it is virtually impossible to find anyone who is against the idea on principle.</p> \n<p>The reason we have ended up here is because of, as so often, the shortsighted and internecine nature of football politics and power games as played out by grey men in grey suits. The English FA was keen to put a team forward forboth the women’s and men’s competitions. With various levels of vigour, the idea was rejected by the other home nations who continue to maintain that to play in a joint team at the Olympics could, over time, undermine the sovereignty of the individual bodies.</p> \n<p>If there was to be no men’s team on principle, they railed, there could be no women’s side either. As it turned out, the men would not have qualified anyway because of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">the limp performance</a> of Gareth Southgate’s England Under-21 side in the Czech Republic.</p> \n<p>Obviously, it is hard to take much of what Fifa says seriously but, for what it’s worth, there have been repeated assurances from Zurich, both verbal and written, that playing a British side in the Olympics would not undermine the case for separate national teams elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Sometimes another rationale is put forward, that it would threaten the “special privileges” enjoyed by the home nations at Fifa – a guaranteed seat on the executive committee and a place on the Ifab board that codifies the laws of the game.</p> \n<p>Those privileges are being steadily whittled away in any case and should arguably be voluntarily surrendered if we are to take the moral high ground in the debate on Fifa reform.</p> \n<p>It is hard not to conclude that the most vociferous reaction, from the Football Association of Wales chairman, Trefor Lloyd-Hughes, was not somehow bound up in his personal disappointment at being passed over for the Fifa executive committee <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/24/david-gill-fifa-vice-president\" title=\"\">in favour of the English FA’s favoured candidate, David Gill</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/england-japan-postgame-coach-comments\">Laura Bassett is in a hard place right now … but she's a hero, says Lionesses coach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Under the previous Buggins’ turn formula it would have been time for a Welsh representative but under a new system in which Uefa votes on which candidate should take the seat Gill jumped the queue – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-fa-david-gill-resigned-fifa\" title=\"\">only to resign anyway when Blatter was re-elected</a>.</p> \n<p>Lloyd-Hughes, a retired ambulance driver from Anglesey, was furious at what he saw as English arrogance and was “livid” when he heard about the Team GB plans. Some of the resentment felt by the FAs in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland towards England is justified. There can be a tendency towards loftily deciding what is right for all four.</p> \n<p>However, to let such petty politicking and confusing internal rows get in the way of the development of a sport that should be at the forefront of faltering efforts to deliver a legacy from the London Olympics, and the thorny issue of engaging teenage girls in sport, is appalling. Surely the obvious compromise was to enter a women’s side and leave the more contentious issue of the men for another day?</p> \n<p>Not only will Sampson’s side be denied the opportunity to build on their momentum in Rio, for the handful of players from the other home nations who would have been in contention for a place in the squad the chance to play in an Olympics on the world stage is gone – probably for good.</p> \n<p>The Women’s Super League is now well established but has been a slow burn in terms of building attendances. Yet healthy audiences for England’s World Cup matches on the BBC, despite the time difference, have shown the appetite is there on the big occasion.
