Farah retaliated before the Birmingham indoor grand prix by accusing Vernon of questioning his nationality when the pair won 10,000m gold and silver at last year’s world championships.</p> \n<p>Farah, under intense pressure in recent weeks since the BBC’s Panorama made <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/06/mo-farah-alberto-salazar-doping-allegations-panorama\" title=\"\">doping allegations about Alberto Salazar</a>, which the coach has denied, was a picture of delight when he crossed the line. But Vernon claimed things turned ugly immediately afterwards when he tried to bury the hatchet before he travels to Font Romeu where Farah has been training.</p> \n<p>“I went to shake his hand and he turned his back on me and told me to fuck off. I’m glad you saw it. I wanted to bury the hatchet, I’m going up to Font Romeu in a few days’ time and I just wanted to end it,” said Vernon, who finished 15th. “It’s in the past, I don’t know why we can’t just forget about it. He’s done to me a lot worse than I’ve done to him and to not even be a sportsman there and shake my hand I think is pretty disgraceful, to be honest.</p> \n<p>“With all the bad publicity he’s getting at the moment I would have thought he would try to actually make a good name for himself again but by doing that it’s not too good for him,” added Vernon. “Like in the armed forces, you salute the rank, not the person sometimes. I wanted to congratulate the performance. Whether we’re friends or not, I can appreciate a good performance so I’d like to congratulate him but I get that reaction.”</p> \n<p>Both parties had earlier said they wanted to draw a line under the embarrassing row in February. Last month Vernon said he was “not surprised” that Farah had chosen to stick with Salazar but added that if he could deal with any backlash then “good luck to him”. Asked whether there was an incident with Vernon after the race, Farah said: “I don’t know, not that I saw,” and refused to comment further.</p> \n<p>The incident took the gloss off a cathartic victory for Farah against a high-class field. “The race had everybody in it, it wasn’t an easy race, it was like a mini-worlds. I wanted to come out here and race against the guys before the worlds, I was happy with the way I finished the race, I enjoyed it,” he said. “As an athlete you just have to do what you best. The last couple of weeks have been hard for my family and everyone else. But what can you do? You just want to run and that’s what I did and I enjoyed it.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/9/1436475780201/mo-farah-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah celebrates with the 'Mobot' after winning the 5,000 metres in the Diamond League meeting in Lausanne.

Once Williams consolidated with a pair of heat-seeking 118mph aces, the greatest front-runner in sports had all the edge she needed.</p> \n<p>The world’s two highest-profile sportswomen may compete for the same endorsements, column inches and trophies, but Williams’s straightforward victory to book a place in the final – where she will face the Spanish ing&eacute;nue Garbi&ntilde;e Muguruza – proved once again this is no more a rivalry than hammer v nail.</p> \n<p>“It’s never easy to beat such a great player who’s had such a wonderful career,” Williams said following a 6-4, 6-2 victory in which she crunched 29 winners and 13 aces. “Whenever you play someone that has beaten you before, you get really focused.”</p> \n<p>No one can accuse the world No1 of having a short memory. Williams has now won 17 straight matches against Sharapova extending back 11 years, an astonishing run that includes six meetings at grand slams and three in major finals. In 13 outings since they met here five years ago, Sharapova has taken just one set.</p> \n<p>The 33-year-old from Compton, California flummoxed Sharapova with her rangy court coverage and ability to uncork flat, sharply angled groundstrokes with depth and pace. What few moments of danger Williams encountered, she escaped with efficiency and aplomb. Sharapova faced break points in six of her nine service games while Williams did not face a break point.</p> \n<p>What’s happened with Williams v Sharapova can no longer be explained away as an anomaly. The five-times Wimbledon champion has mastered an oppressive, pugilistic style that Sharapova has neither the nerve nor tactical versatility to match.</p> \n<p>“I always expect her to play the best tennis against myself,” a despondent Sharapova said. “You have to be able not to just produce your best tennis, but more. Obviously it hasn’t happened for me.”</p> \n<p>Now she is one win from holding all four grand slam titles simultaneously, an achievement so rare she became its namesake – the “Serena Slam” – when she first did it in 2003. And with losses in only four major finals out of 24 played, she is no doubt the overwhelming favourite.</p> \n<p>One mark of Williams’ excellence is how she has always heightened her game against the best of her era. Consider her head-to-head record against the other players who have spent time at No1 over the past decade: Victoria Azarenka (16 wins, 3 defeats), Caroline Wozniacki (10-1), Jelena Jankovic (10-4), Kim Clijsters (7-2), Dinara Safina (6-1), Ana Ivanovic (8-1), Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo (10-2), Lindsay Davenport (10-4).</p> \n<p>Only Justine Henin (8-6) kept it close among her top rivals, though Williams inflicted some famous beatings when they met. But no one has felt the back end of her wrath more consistently than Sharapova. “It’s strange because a lot of the people I grew up with are now on the legends tour,” Williams said with a laugh. “Me and Venus just laugh. We’re just enjoying our time. We’re so fortunate to still be playing.

Then, after the first day, England were 336 for seven and went on to make 435. This time they resumed the second day on 343 for seven and by the time Jimmy Anderson was dismissed they had reached 430, with Moeen Ali making a fine 77 before going down with guns blazing in the cause.</p> \n<p>Whether Australia can go on and reprise the 674 for six they made on that occasion remains to be seen, but by the close of the second day they were struggling to reach parity. The England bowling was excellent, particularly during the final session when they overwhelmed the Australians for a period. Anderson produced an immaculate spell that brought him four successive maiden overs and thus helped Moeen, who had already dismissed Steve Smith, to take the valuable wicket of Michael Clarke.</p> \n<p>Australia will resume on 264 for five, 166 adrift still, of which the veteran opener Chris Rogers, playing in his last Test series before he retires, made 95. The day finished with Australia on the defensive, a nightwatchman in place and predatory fielders all round the bat. Already some perspective can be placed on the ease with which Joe Root had batted for England on the first day.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457459028__\n</div> \n<p>This was a considerably different pitch, though, to the turgid strip of the first day that emasculated the pace of the three Australian seamers. The sun shone all day and the strip looked a lighter shade of brown, an indication that some of the moisture had evaporated. There was less swing too, both with the old ball that the Australians were using in their quest to finish off the England innings and, significantly, when England had the new ball. The pace and carry was also better and more consistent so that Jos Buttler had an easier time of it behind the stumps than had Brad Haddin.</p> \n<p>More pace, of course, means that the Australians will find more reason to bend their backs second time round, but it also means that the batsmen have pace on the ball to exploit. Were it not for the fact that the ball at times jags off the seam disconcertingly it might be seen as a belter: the number of batsmen who seem to have settled in and then got out shows it is not quite. The occasional movement is enough to keep the bowlers interested and the batsmen honest. There are still plenty of runs to be had but they won’t come easily.</p> \n<p>It was Mitchell Starc of the Australian bowlers who prospered, adding the wickets of Moeen and Anderson to the three he had taken on the first day to finish with five for 114, which, as he looked the most dangerous bowler throughout the innings, was just reward.</p> \n<p>Mitchell Johnson, on the other hand, will have bowled a lot worse and emerged with more flattering figures than none for 111, the century greeted with an ironic standing ovation by the crowd to which he responded in good part by doffing his cap and kissing the badge on it. The second innings might bring him something about which to cheer.</p> \n<p>Moeen rode his luck a little but played with elegant panache for his runs. He drives sublimely through the offside in particular, reached an excellent half century from 69 balls, and was finally dismissed driving at, and edging, Starc to first slip.</p> \n<p>Stuart Broad, meanwhile, had survived a chance to short leg in which Adam Voges, diving into the crease, unknowingly surely, grounded the ball in the flurry so that Broad was eventually recalled following replays. Broad was able to hang around long enough to help add 52 for the eighth wicket before he heaved at the first ball of the day from Nathan Lyon and was caught at the wicket.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/09/england-moeen-ali-first-ashes-test-australia-cricket\">England’s Moeen Ali impresses with bat and ball in his first Ashes Test | Vic Marks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Anderson and Broad came at Australia hard with the ball, with Broad at his most urgent and pushing the speed gun up around 90mph, a velocity he had not managed all winter. It was Anderson, though, who made England’s first breakthrough, inducing a drive from David Warner which found the edge and screamed to the right of Alastair Cook at first slip – he held on even as the ball was searing past him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e41644c8e08dcf117a2748466759482b7ecdaa81\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436470760667/c982f811-726a-430f-8129-52b2e6d915d2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rogers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Rogers cuts during his innings of 95 for Australia at Cardiff.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It brought to the crease Smith, and with it an air of curiosity to see quite how this young batsman had been transformed. Key is his decision to take charge of his game himself and do the simple things well. He has a trigger movement on to off stump and so is well placed to make judgment outside, and is consequently prolific off his legs. There is confidence and adventure too, and when Moeen came on he belted him twice to the onside of straight, taking the ball from outside off stump each time, and then once over extra cover for good measure.</p> \n<p>To the credit of Cook, he kept Moeen on and was rewarded when the bowler, perhaps anticipating Smith advancing again, speared the ball in towards his legs. Somehow Smith got in a tangle, tried to work the ball square but sent it instead from a chunky leading edge to the straighter of two fielders placed short on the legside. Modern bats can be the curse of bowlers but Bradman’s edge would never have carried the ball as far.</p> \n<p>Moeen was also to claim the wicket of Michael Clarke, who, an excellent player of spin, was looking to get after him even as Anderson was tying up the other end so brilliantly. Now, though, he came down to drive once again but this time hit a firm return catch which the bowler snaffled with ease: two huge wickets for Moeen and a huge boost to his confidence. In between times Rogers, playing immaculately, had hit 11 fours and a six and had seemed certain to reach his fourth Ashes hundred when he tried to cut Mark Wood and edged to Buttler.</p> \n<p>There was one more wicket, that of Voges, before the close, and it went to a persevering and deserving Ben Stokes, working up a real head of steam, who got a full-length ball to jag back off the seam as the batsman looked for the drive. The inevitably mistimed shot went gently to extra cover.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/9/1436467013769/moeen-ali-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Moeen Ali, centre, takes the congratulations of his team-mates after dismissing Australia's Michael Clarke with a slower ball for 38.

Denying British women the opportunity to play in it at such a crucial time for the sport’s development is looking more and more myopic with each passing day.</p> \n<p>Is the women’s game in the UK so well developed, so strong at the grassroots, so popular with fans, so embedded in schools, that it can afford to pass up the chance of one of the greatest shop windows it will ever have? Of course not. On the contrary, it is at a crucial phase in its development.</p> \n<p>To pass on the opportunity to play in Brazil – the home of the beautiful game, in a country where women’s football is taken seriously, in front of passionate crowds, as part of a British Olympic team, with all that entails – starts to feel like an act of vandalism.</p> \n<p>The arguments around a men’s team – as played out in the runup to London 2012 – are different and more contentious. For many reasons, from fixture congestion to the conflicted feelings of some fans, there are as many arguments against as for. That is just not the case when it comes to the women’s game, where it is virtually impossible to find anyone who is against the idea on principle.</p> \n<p>The reason we have ended up here is because of, as so often, the shortsighted and internecine nature of football politics and power games as played out by grey men in grey suits. The English FA was keen to put a team forward forboth the women’s and men’s competitions. With various levels of vigour, the idea was rejected by the other home nations who continue to maintain that to play in a joint team at the Olympics could, over time, undermine the sovereignty of the individual bodies.</p> \n<p>If there was to be no men’s team on principle, they railed, there could be no women’s side either. As it turned out, the men would not have qualified anyway because of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">the limp performance</a> of Gareth Southgate’s England Under-21 side in the Czech Republic.</p> \n<p>Obviously, it is hard to take much of what Fifa says seriously but, for what it’s worth, there have been repeated assurances from Zurich, both verbal and written, that playing a British side in the Olympics would not undermine the case for separate national teams elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Sometimes another rationale is put forward, that it would threaten the “special privileges” enjoyed by the home nations at Fifa – a guaranteed seat on the executive committee and a place on the Ifab board that codifies the laws of the game.</p> \n<p>Those privileges are being steadily whittled away in any case and should arguably be voluntarily surrendered if we are to take the moral high ground in the debate on Fifa reform.</p> \n<p>It is hard not to conclude that the most vociferous reaction, from the Football Association of Wales chairman, Trefor Lloyd-Hughes, was not somehow bound up in his personal disappointment at being passed over for the Fifa executive committee <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/24/david-gill-fifa-vice-president\" title=\"\">in favour of the English FA’s favoured candidate, David Gill</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/england-japan-postgame-coach-comments\">Laura Bassett is in a hard place right now … but she's a hero, says Lionesses coach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Under the previous Buggins’ turn formula it would have been time for a Welsh representative but under a new system in which Uefa votes on which candidate should take the seat Gill jumped the queue – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-fa-david-gill-resigned-fifa\" title=\"\">only to resign anyway when Blatter was re-elected</a>.</p> \n<p>Lloyd-Hughes, a retired ambulance driver from Anglesey, was furious at what he saw as English arrogance and was “livid” when he heard about the Team GB plans. Some of the resentment felt by the FAs in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland towards England is justified. There can be a tendency towards loftily deciding what is right for all four.</p> \n<p>However, to let such petty politicking and confusing internal rows get in the way of the development of a sport that should be at the forefront of faltering efforts to deliver a legacy from the London Olympics, and the thorny issue of engaging teenage girls in sport, is appalling. Surely the obvious compromise was to enter a women’s side and leave the more contentious issue of the men for another day?</p> \n<p>Not only will Sampson’s side be denied the opportunity to build on their momentum in Rio, for the handful of players from the other home nations who would have been in contention for a place in the squad the chance to play in an Olympics on the world stage is gone – probably for good.</p> \n<p>The Women’s Super League is now well established but has been a slow burn in terms of building attendances. Yet healthy audiences for England’s World Cup matches on the BBC, despite the time difference, have shown the appetite is there on the big occasion.
