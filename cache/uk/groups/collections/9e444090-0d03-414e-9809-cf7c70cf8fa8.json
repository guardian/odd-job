34-28 Salford</p>","byline":"Press Association","body":"<p>Dane Tilse scored his first try in the English game as the Challenge Cup semi-finalists Hull KR continued their impressive home form to haul themselves out of Super League’s bottom four for the first time since April.</p> \n<p>The prop’s touchdown 10 minutes into the second half sparked a purple patch for Rovers, who turned a 10-8 interval deficit into a commanding 26-10 lead and then held off a dramatic late fightback from Salford to secure a precious 34-28 victory.</p> \n<p>The Red Devils are now resigned to finishing in the bottom four after losing their game in hand and will be hoping the arrival of the new director of rugby, Tim Sheens, in a week’s time will provide them with a boost ahead of the Super 8s.</p> \n<p>Salford, who had Adrian Morley making the 550th appearance of his career, dominated the early part of the game but it was against the run of play when Rovers opened the scoring on 13 minutes.</p> \n<p>The scrum-half Albert Kelly caught out the Red Devils’ defence by running the ball on the last tackle and his precision kick to the corner was pounced on by the winger Ben Cockayne.</p> \n<p>The Rovers stand-off Maurice Blair then had a try disallowed for a knock-on and Salford went in front with two tries in nine minutes.</p> \n<p>Cory Paterson, one of four former Rovers players in the Salford ranks, stole the ball in a one-on-one tackle on the unfortunate full-back Kieran Dixon and fed the alert winger Mason Caton-Brown.</p> \n<p>Josh Griffin’s goal made it 6-4 and the Red Devils extended their lead when Dobson’s cut-out pass got Ben Jones-Bishop over in the other corner for the first of his two tries.</p> \n<p>When Dixon fumbled another of Dobson’s high kicks that caught in the swirling wind, it was the signal for the coach Chris Chester to switch him away from the firing line and he instantly made his mark on the wing, finishing decisively for the Robins’ second try after Kelly had provided the key pass.</p> \n<p>Josh Mantellato was again unable to master the tricky wind but Rovers were well in the contest at the interval, especially after the Salford prop Lama Tasi had been held up on his back just before the hooter sounded.</p> \n<p>If Salford shaded the first half, they went walkabout in the third quarter as Rovers turned the game on its head with three tries in a devastating eight-minute spell.</p> \n<p>The hooker Shaun Lunt got Tilse crashing over with a short pass from dummy half and two minutes later burst clear to send the centre Kris Welham over.</p> \n<p>The game was completely transformed when Blair charged through some flimsy defence for a solo try and Mantellato’s third goal made it 26-10.</p> \n<p>Before the home fans could celebrate, however, they were forced to endure a tense finish after the stand-off Theo Fages created two tries in five minutes for the forwards Jordan Walne and another former Hull KR man, Scott Taylor.</p> \n<p>Griffin converted both to cut the deficit to just four points to set up a frantic finish.</p> \n<p>Mantellato put some more daylight between the teams with a penalty but it was all square when Fages combined with Chase to get Jones-Bishop over for his second try eight minutes from the end and Griffin kicked his fourth goal.</p> \n<p>But before either side could think about a drop goal, Kelly pounced with the winning try, taking advantage of a tough bounce from the restart to regather and touch down.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435703501266/6a7de676-ae1a-4688-bbe0-ae31a3784940-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ed

Germany, ranked No1 and the tournament’s strongest attacking unit, looked unprepared for USA’s pressure. </p> \n<p>“We knew we had this in us. This team had a lot of confidence and we’ve done a really good job of blocking out you guys,” USA coach Jill Ellis told reporters after the game. “We had every belief we could win this game and that’s part of the spirit of the American player.”</p> \n<p>This pulsating semi-final was physical from the get-go — Alexandra Popp needed her head bandaged after a gruesome collision — but it would be a pair of penalties that went a long way to deciding the game.</p> \n<p>Annike Krahn desperately hip-checked forward Alex Morgan to the ground in the 68th minute, drawing a yellow card and a penalty. Nadine Angerer guessed the wrong way and Lloyd calmly slotted the ball home, finally breaking the deadlock. </p> \n<p>The Germany coach, Silvia Neid, noted correctly that replays showed the foul occurred outside of the box. </p> \n<p>“Of course, I’m very sad that this penalty decided the match,” she said. “What am I going to do though? A referee’s decision is something we have to live with.”</p> \n<p>Germany had their own chance from the spot 10 minutes earlier, but Sasic, tied for leading scorer of the tournament, bungled her attempt and shot wide of goal. Popp earned the penalty after being pulled down by an uncharacteristically shaky Julie Johnston.</p> \n<p>“That was probably every defender’s worst nightmare. It happened so fast,” Johnston said. “This was a team performance and the team today really stepped up for me. I really can’t thank them enough and I think I’ll thank them all the way to the final.”</p> \n<p>The Germans are deprived of a shot at a third world title while USA can set a record if they win their third in Vancouver on Sunday. USA will face the winner of the England v Japan semi-final on Wednesday night.</p> \n<p>Though Ellis had used a 4-4-2 formation with two strikers up front throughout the tournament, she changed things up for this match in a surprise move, instead switching to a 4-2-3-1 with Morgan as the lone forward.</p> \n<p>Lloyd’s role was an open question going into the match, and Ellis opted to give her what she wanted: a chance to roam in the box for goals, while central midfielders Morgan Brian and Lauren Holiday mopped up German attacks. Lloyd essentially turned into USA’s second striker, focused entirely on offense.</p> \n<p>It was a masterstroke from Ellis. Lloyd ended up the hero again after her stellar performance against China just days ago. She scored the penalty and set up Kelley O’Hara for the second goal by dribbling her way through Germany’s backline in the 86th minute. Her pass met a lunging O’Hara in front of Angerer’s goal. </p> \n<p>O’Hara’s finish was as emphatic as it was ruthless, and it was her first-ever for the US senior national team.</p> \n<p>“It’s euphoric, to be honest. It was something I was not expecting,” O’Hara said. “I’m kind of still processing it. I’m so proud of this team and as a sub you just want to help your team however you can, bring energy to the game.”</p> \n<p>The Americans had the better chances all day, but Angerer single-handedly kept the Germans in the match in the first half with some splendid saves to deny what should have been a couple of USA goals.</p> \n<p>In the seventh minute, center-back Johnston connected well with her head on a set piece to direct the ball toward the far post, but Angerer saved brilliantly with her feet. Shortly afterwards, Angerer denied Morgan on a one-on-one breakaway after a clever ball from Tobin Heath.</p> \n<p>Germany out-shot USA, 15 to 12, but USA had five chances on goal to Germany’s one. Germany held possession for stretches, but their attack was unable to find a way through the Americans. </p> \n<p>“It was an even match, but we did not follow through,” Neid said. “We weren’t dangerous enough in front of goal.” </p> \n<p>Angerer agreed. “I think we didn’t give up, even after we were down 1-0,” she said. “But at the end of the day, I think the US earned the win today.”</p> \n<p>Both teams had been considered favorites going into the tournament and appeared destined to meet in the semi-final. Of the three times these teams have faced one another in a Women’s World Cup, the winner has gone on to lift the trophy.</p> \n<p>Germany had dominated this year’s tournament, recording the most goals and most shots of any team by a significant margin.

Now a 34-year-old veteran lumbering into his 11th year of Test cricket - pundits furiously debate whether Watson or the youthful and ascendant Mitch Marsh should claim Australia’s all-rounder slot when the Ashes begins next week in Cardiff.</p> \n<p>If Darren Lehmann is to be taken at face value much will depend on the bowling speeds Watson generates throughout Australia’s final tour match against Essex because the coach favours both pace and the presence of an all-rounder in his Test sides.</p> \n<p>Should he though? If either Watson or Marsh ends up having a series-turning impact with both bat and ball it will go against half a century’s worth of Australian cricket history because the last man to do so during an away Ashes trip was Alan Davidson in 1961. </p> \n<p>Even as Watson found some batting success in the 2013 and 2009 series, it came with virtually no bowling impact in conditions not inhospitable to his wobbly, partnership-breaking seamers. To think he could do much more than hold up an end in a series such as this one feels like a stretch. Ashes wins are secured by strike bowlers, not fill-ins.</p> \n<p>To be fair, Marsh is not himself the irresistible prospect with the Dukes ball in his hand that he is batting - taking just the single wicket in 366 Test deliveries so far and having quite clearly lost some oomph in the process of recalibrating the action that kept crocking him. Touted by Rod Marsh upon his debut Test selection as an exciting bowling prospect, Marsh still looks very much like a batsman who can bowl a little bit.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/jason-gillespie-australia-ashes-england\">Jason Gillespie: Australia start as Ashes favourites in England – and rightly so</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>What he does have in spades though is a Lehmann-esque freedom and fearlessness to his cricket. At one point of his and Watson’s partnership in the first tour game against Kent, Marsh outscored his senior teammate 77 runs to 5 on the way to a blazing century. In favorable batting conditions Watson continued with that unfortunate knack for posting scores that symbolize his short-comings; the in-and-out ‘Watto Lotto’ 21 of the first innings, and then the unfairly exasperating not-quite-hundred of the second, when he holed out for 81. </p> \n<p>Marsh grew up in a family where the life of international cricket always stood at close and familiar quarters so - you’d guess - possibly seems to him a far less intimidating vocation than it might to others. By contrast, Watson still bats with the neurotic air of a body-builder pensively assessing whether the next deadlift could do him in for good. Both men possess the tools to take a session and perhaps an entire Test away from England but only Marsh actually seems likely to do so these days. </p> \n<p>The second-in-line senior reserve batsman’s slot would be a strange sort of role for Watson to finish up in given that sustained period he enjoyed atop the list of limited overs cricket’s most belligerent and impactful players, but it seems so long since he last strode to the crease like Whelan the Wrecker and lay waste to bowling attacks; something he never quite managed at Test level anyway.</p> \n<p>England does at least hold memories of personal successes but Watson’s one genuinely imposing score in Test cricket – 176 at The Oval in 2013 – came when the series was already lost and after one of the most poignant Watsonian Test series sequences; 13, 46, 30, 20, 19, 18, 68 and 2. Should they elect to pick him the Australian selectors can’t expect any greater returns this time around. In 16 Test innings since the 103 he made against England in Perth during December 2013, Watson has scored only three half-centuries and all of them came when the series trophy was already in the bag. </p> \n<p>Most likely Watson will finish his Test career in the position he’s always occupied, battling against his physical, technical and emotional shortcomings at the crease, giving rise to spirited selection debate and only grudgingly admired for his persistence at Test level when he might instead have retreated permanently to the lucrative and less demanding T20 circuit.</p> \n<p>On the batting of another fill-in Australian Test captain, Brian Booth, cricket writing doyen Ray Robinson theorized that “his style might have been influenced by unorthodox circuitry in his nervous and muscular system.” You wonder what he would have made of Watson’s reflexively thrusted front pad, muscular pounding of the ball and the incredulous facial reactions shot at any bowler with the temerity to verbally joust with the Australian.</p> \n<p>If youth wins the day and Marsh is indeed the man for the job in this Ashes series and beyond, there still remains the likelihood that he or a teammate will tire and need the capable relief that Watson can offer on his final Ashes voyage. </p> \n<p>Say hello, wave goodbye.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bd98a0842429585fa2cc1f0757b1cca6ef111116/0_0_3549_2130/3549.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2130,"width":3549,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"John Sibley/REUTERS","altText":"Shane Watson","cleanCredit":"Photograph: John Sibley/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T07:37:22Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T07:44:28Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Russell Jackson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/russell-jackson"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Ashes 2015","The Ashes","Australia cricket team","Cricket","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/ashes-2015","webTitle":"Ashes 2015"},{"id":"sport/ashes","webTitle":"The Ashes"},{"id":"sport/australia-cricket-team","webTitle":"Australia cricket team"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Russell Jackson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/russell-jackson"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/01/watson-marsh-australia-selection-headache","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9n9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/01/watson-marsh-australia-selection-headache","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/01/watson-marsh-australia-selection-headache"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bd98a0842429585fa2cc1f0757b1cca6ef111116/0_0_3549_2130/3549.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2130,"width":3549,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Beleaguered all-rounder Shane Watson will need to prove his case against Essex, as Australian coach Darren Lehmann runs the rule over Watson and Mitchell Marsh.
