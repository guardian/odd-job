A sweaty cat’s cradle of arms and Dictaphones strained to get closer, but only those nearest heard the pledge that will be broadcast repeatedly if the smoke swirling around Rupp and his coach Alberto Salazar erupts into fire. “I believe in clean sport and I believe the truth will prevail.”</p> \n<p>Moments earlier, Rupp – a silver medallist at London 2012 and a training partner of Mo Farah – had found his feet to win his seventh consecutive US 10,000m championships. Finding his voice took longer. But nervously, hesitantly, he rediscovered it.</p> \n<p>“The people here are so great,” he said, when asked about the standing ovation he received after crossing the line. “The support has been tremendous. I was obviously pleased to get another championship and to do it here in Eugene, it’s always special.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/26/mo-farah-continue-working-with-alberto-salazar\">Mo Farah: ‘I want to make it clear – I will continue working with Alberto Salazar’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This was Rupp’s first race since a BBC Panorama documentary accused him of stretching and snapping anti-doping rules. But back at Hayward Field, where he ran in college for Oregon, he was greeted as more of a homecoming hero than someone fighting to remove a stain against his name.</p> \n<p>Not everyone was cheering. One coach, who did not want to be named, feared the allegations were “the tip of the iceberg” and said USA Track and Field had not done enough to investigate. Not that he was surprised. “Look around you at the billboards,” he said. “And ask yourself who sponsors this championship and Alberto?”</p> \n<p>Along the back straight there was a ready answer: a Nike.com/running sign was stapled to a USA Track and Field one.</p> \n<p>Earlier, while other athletes warmed up in the practice field or had their muscles shaken into life on one of 28 massage tables, Rupp limbered up in private. Only when the final call for registrations crackled through on the public address system did he trot over to Salazar for final instructions. He then crossed himself twice before hugging the man he sees as a second father.</p> \n<p>As Rupp went to the start, Salazar spoke for the first time since being accused of giving Rupp testosterone as a 16-year-old. He insisted he was “feeling good” despite the allegations swimming around him and ruled out legal action against the BBC and the US news website ProPublica, adding: “I’m not a vindictive person.” Despite Salazar’s upbeat words, his face told a different story. It looked tired and withdrawn. Apparently his blood pressure has been through the roof, which is not good for someone whose determination to be the greatest distance athlete of his age – and arguably he was in the early 80s – has left him with health problems. Remember, too, that he was clinically dead for 14 minutes after suffering a heart attack in 2007.</p> \n<p>But Salazar lives and breathes every race that Rupp enters and watching his friend from the corporate hospitality area proved a sprightly pick-me-up. There were shouts of lap splits and encouragement, including a happy cry of “Let’s go, Galen!” as his athlete powered clear to victory in the final kilometre.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"21dab603a8389fca1a081eece6318bc3ec33d27e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435348001477/75d43b4b-d6c9-46c2-ad75-469ab354f1a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alberto Salazar\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alberto Salazar looks on at Eugene before the start of the men’s 10,00m.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Don Ryan/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was an impressive performance, especially in conditions more like a steam room. But while Rupp was being photographed hugging his baby twins, the second-placed athlete, Ben True, was explaining why he had a very different ethos from his Nike Oregon Project rival.</p> \n<p>“Allegations are allegations and rumours are rumours but I am very much against doping,” he said. “Use of therapeutic use exemptions, legal or not, are against the spirit of the sport. I don’t even take ibuprofen. I don’t drink recovery drinks. I have Gatorade maybe twice a year. I take acidophilus now and again and vitamin D in the winter. But I don’t even eat energy bars.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere on the first of four days at these US Trials, Dee Dee Trotter – the 400m bronze medallist at London 2012 and founder of Test Me I’m Clean, which promotes drug-free sport – called for a renewed push to stop people cheating or playing the system.</p> \n<p>“I think drugs in the sport are devastating,” she said. “It’s a tragedy for the hardworking athletes like myself, I consider it to be similar to crime. When you cheat you’re taking something from the person behind you.”</p> \n<p>When asked if sport was winning the fight, her answer brought to mind an unending tango between right and wrong, testers and cheats. “I think drugs in the sport are continuing,” she said. “You think we’re getting better then we take two steps forward and two steps back.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in the mixed zone interview area, Rupp had moved from the press scrum to the TV cameras and was repeating a familiar mantra. “I believe in clean sport and I believe the truth will prevail.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/26/1435347907288/Galen-Rupp-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Galen Rupp crosses the finish line to win the 10,000m at the USA Outdoor Track & Field Championships.

the controversial decision to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/03/americas-cup-ben-ainslie-luna-rossa-row\" title=\"\">reduce the boat size for the competition</a>.</p> \n<p>Earlier this year plans were approved to change boats from 62ft (AC62) catamarans to AC45s in the 45ft to 50ft range for the 2017 competition in Bermuda. The decision resulted in the Italian team Luna Rossa withdrawing from the America’s Cup and Team New Zealand’s chief executive accused the remaining four crews of “self-serving manoeuvring”.</p> \n<p>Ainslie, who won the 2013 America’s Cup in remarkable circumstances against the New Zealanders with Team Oracle USA, is fronting a new British team for the 2017 competition and on Wednesday announced a new partnership with Land Rover. Ainslie’s team was renamed Land Rover BAR at their new multimillion pound base in Portsmouth that became operational this week.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/02/americas-cup-luna-rossa-pull-out\">Luna Rossa pull out of America’s Cup in protest over reduced boat size</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of the row regarding boat size for 2017, Ainslie said: “It was regrettable that Luna Rossa decided to withdraw from the cup – Team New Zealand have been having a pretty tumultuous time of late and I think there is a lot more going on within that team other than just the issues around the class rule.</p> \n<p>“Now we have teams committed to moving forward in this exciting new class of boat, sharing a common goal. Team New Zealand, like ourselves, are heavily reliant on commercial funding. I’ll be hugely surprised that as a commercial team they could suddenly decide to not compete. I’m confident they will be there and be a strong challenger like they have been in the past.</p> \n<p>“We supported the shift to smaller boats for two reasons. Firstly, the longer-term vision from all the teams was to have continuity in the circuit, that we could collectively design a boat for the next America’s Cup and use the same one beyond. The other side was to reduce the costs; this new class of boat is containerised so the logistics of getting it around the world are more achievable.”</p> \n<p>Land Rover, the British automotive manufacturer, becomes a central part of Ainslie’s technical innovation group. It is the latest move by the four-times Olympic sailing champion to cement links with the motor industry, having already recruited Adrian Newey – Formula One’s most decorated designer – and Martin Whitmarsh, the former McLaren team principal who became BAR’s chief executive in March.</p> \n<p>Next month the America’s Cup World Series event takes place in Portsmouth, a qualification race for the 35th America’s Cup in Bermuda.
