If it had been the ankle, it would be a completely different story right now and I’d be telling you something different.”</p> \n<p>The 28-year-old Australian, who won the sprint hurdle world title in 2011 and finished second behind the American Brianna Rollins in Moscow two years later, had surgery on the injury in Italy but will require another operation on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>She said she was disappointed to miss out on the August world championships in Beijing, where she won silver at the 2008 Olympics, but thought the enforced rest might help her bid to retain her 2012 Olympic title in Rio de Janeiro.</p> \n<p>“I guess I haven’t had a break since 2003, my first Australian team,” she added. “I think this will be a very good mental and physical break for me leading into the Olympics next year.”</p> \n<p>Australia’s head coach Craig Hilliard said it was a major blow to lose the country’s most successful current track and field athlete from the team.</p> \n<p>“Sally’s our team captain and she gives great leadership and gets on really well with all the athletes,” he said. “It will be a big loss but the critical thing is that she needs time mentally and physically to get over this.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/15/1434356897516/sally-pearson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sally Pearson shouts in pain after falling during the women's 100 hurdles at the Diamond League meeting in Rome.
