While many of those commenting underneath his statement on Facebook were clearly fans, urging him to fight on against what they saw as damaging slurs, the wider public reaction on Twitter emphasised the scale of the challenge facing the Farah camp and those close to it.</p> \n<p>His exhortation that he had taken hundreds of drug tests and never failed one was met with weary references to Lance Armstrong. The cynicism on show from a sporting public let down one too many times by their heroes was almost the polar opposite of the mood of giddy optimism that reverberated around the Olympic Stadium and the nation as a whole in the summer of 2012.</p> \n<p>Rewind to August of that year and it was one of the biggest months in the life of not only Usain Bolt and Farah but also of their agent Ricky Simms and his burgeoning company Pace Sports Management. As Bolt stood atop the podium doing Farah’s “mobot” and the British double Olympic champion struck the Jamaican dancehall stance that has become the trademark of one of the biggest sporting stars of his generation, it confirmed the London Games as a triumph for all three in not only sporting but commercial terms.</p> \n<p>Farah’s wife, Tania, who had been with Mo since they were at school and exerts a strong hold over his career off the track, was entitled to feel a swell of pride too as she walked the track with their family.</p> \n<p>Alberto Salazar, the coach with the golden touch who had taken Farah’s career to the next level since he joined his Project Oregon team, exuded satisfaction as he chalked up a golden double and his training partner Galen Rupp, the American now at the centre of doping allegations that he and Salazar strenuously deny, picked up a silver in the 10,000m.</p> \n<p>And for the UK Athletics executives looking down from among the 80,000 crowd, Farah’s golds were vital. Even with them they failed to hit the medal targets set before the Games, but they provided the vital magic moments prayed for by everyone from UKA to London 2012 chairman, Lord Coe (another man now wearing multiple hats, including chair of the British Olympic Association, Nike advisor, IAAF presidential candidate and avowed friend of Salazar, amid the fallout from this mess).</p> \n<p>Three years on Farah finds himself engaged in a very different battle – not for medals but for the trust of the public – and pulled in every direction by the competing advice and priorities of all four. While Salazar has gone to ground, unfairly or not increasing suspicion with every day he stays silent and prepares his defence against the claims by the BBC’s Panorama, Farah has appeared to have been left twisting in the wind.</p> \n<p>After initially bolting from Birmingham and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/mo-farah-flies-us-confront-alberto-salazar-doping-allegations\" title=\"\">returning to Oregon</a> to “seek answers” from Salazar, he is now in the south of France preparing for his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/17/mo-farah-return-track-monaco-diamond-league\" title=\"\">return to the track in Monaco</a> next month.</p> \n<p>Simms, who handles other members of the Nike-sponsored Project Oregon team including Rupp, cannot help but have been conflicted. In all there are at least five athletes on Pace’s books who currently train with Salazar or have been linked with the project – Mary Cain, Matthew Centrowitz, Shannon Rowbury, Jordan Hasay and Rupp among them.</p> \n<p>It is Simms, hands-on with his charges even as the sums they can attract in the form of sponsorship and appearance fees has soared, who appears to have been advising Farah to stay silent until Salazar has said his piece.</p> \n<p>But every day that has gone by since that initial Panorama was broadcast has made Farah appear less sure of his ground. That impression only intensified in the wake of this week’s revelation that he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/mo-farah-fresh-questions-missed-drug-tests\" title=\"\">missed two tests within one 18-month window</a> during the run-up to London 2012.</p> \n<p>The amateurish video that then emerged of Simms trying to prove to UK Anti-Doping that Farah could not hear his doorbell when testers came to call in 2011 will not do wonders for his reputation.</p> \n<p>Farah’s loyalties to Simms, Salazar and, of course, Tania run deep. It was Simms who acted as coach, mentor and agent at various points in Farah’s development from callow prospect to late-flowering world beater, in 2006 famously moving him into a house in Teddington with some of his Kenyan charges.</p> \n<p>According to Farah folklore it was the moment he realised he had to get serious if he was to challenge the best. “Mo has seen that their life is running, sleeping, running,” said Simms at the time, before also playing a pivotal role in the decision to move to Oregon and join Salazar in 2011 before the Games.</p> \n<p>Pace now has more than 50 clients listed on its website but Simms prides himself on maintaining his hands-on approach. His priority is his athletes to the exclusion of all else but that can sometimes appear to blind him to the fact that, in Bolt and Farah in particular, he now has two names that transcend their sport and, particularly in the wake of London 2012, have become fair game for the front half of the newspapers as well as the back.</p> \n<p>A series of avoidable missteps dulled the golden post-2012 glow: the six-figure fee that Farah took home for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/apr/18/mo-farah-london-marathon-criticism\" title=\"\">running half of the London marathon</a> in 2013, which could have been mitigated by simply taking the full amount the following year; the spat with the Daily Mail over a story about his family; the Twitter rows with fellow athletes; that bizarre episode where he refused to reveal the names of his newborn twins but then unveiled them in an exclusive interview with a celebrity magazine.</p> \n<p>All those incidents drew on a well of goodwill that had once seemed inexhaustible and now leave Simms in a tricky position as he attempts to reconcile responsibilities to Farah, to Rupp, to Project Oregon and to his business. He is not the only one conflicted. As noted several times in the past fortnight, UK Athletics – which is currently conducting a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/12/uk-athletics-mo-farah-alberto-salazar-review-relationship\" title=\"\">review of its relationship with Salazar</a> – has its own questions to answer too.</p> \n<p>The one thing that is clear at the end of a week that leaves more questions than answers for Farah, despite his belated and welcome statement, is that all of this could have been handled so much better from the start. And that the next six months will define the way that Farah is remembered by a generation for whom his immortality once seemed inviolable.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/19/1434730351148/Mo-Farah-Usain-Bolt-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah and Usain Bolt on the podium at the Olympic Stadium in 2012, headier times for the British athlete.

For all there has been criticism of this venue, and plenty of it, two marquee names are the most prominent. <br /></p> \n<p>Spieth’s 67 on day two and a 69 for Reed leaves them tied at five under. They will thereby partner each other on Saturday, just like Perthshire but this time in direct combat. Branden Grace and Dustin Johnson lie a stroke further back in what may now become a mass attempt to tread water; only 16 players in the field are under par. Poor greens and what is expected to be a ferocious course set-up means low scoring over the weekend is highly unlikely at best. </p> \n<p>“I actually felt it was a pretty disappointing round,” said Reed. “To have five or six bogeys, I didn’t get up and down once, I was 0% on up-and-downs today. But we’re in a good position and we hopefully can have a good weekend and have a chance to win.</p> \n<p>“Anytime I play with Jordan I enjoy it. The main thing for me is to stay focused and focus on what I need to do to play some good golf. And plot my way around this golf course, especially if it gets firmer and faster.”</p> \n<p>Rory McIlroy faces a battle to play himself into contention. The world No1 started day two at two over par, a situation he had improved by one when reaching the 17th tee. McIlroy promptly four-putted the penultimate hole for a double bogey and dropped another shot at the last. Back to back rounds of 72 are hardly disastrous at this venue but, at nine shots adrift of the lead, McIlroy will find it difficult to make up ground. He has endured a particularly frustrating time on the greens. </p> \n<p>The defending champion Martin Kaymer was amongst the high profile names in the Friday afternoon wave of play to miss the cut, which was only confirmed at plus five after 9pm local time on Friday. When it finally was, an agonising bogey on his final hole by the 19-year-old amateur Nick Hardy meant a batch of high profile players survived for the weekend. Colin Montgomerie, Angel Cabrera, Ian Poulter, Jimmy Walker and Sergio Garcia were amongst that relieved group. So, too, was the Scottish qualifier Jimmy Gunn. </p> \n<p>Earlier on Friday, Jason Day’s management team issued an updated statement which confirmed the Australian retains hope of completing the Open.
