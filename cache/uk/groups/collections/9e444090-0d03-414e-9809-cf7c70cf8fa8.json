This year, he has trebled that number.</p> \n<p>Fifteen years to the day since Woods won the US Open by 15 shots, he topped a three-wood from the middle of the 18th fairway at Chambers Bay into the deepest bunker on the course. Already nine over par, his hopes of breaking 80 suddenly vanished. He has rarely looked so dejected, so beaten, so incapable of the rousing return for which many golfing fans long. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/henrik-stenson-dustin-johnson-us-open\">Henrik Stenson and Dustin Johnson rise above mishaps to lead US Open</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This has become painful viewing, which leaves onlookers to wonder just how Woods truly feels about his sharp demise. For all he has been adamant that more competitive play is the key to improved performance, the 14-time major winner is suffering embarrassment after embarrassment in front of the watching world. Cole Hammer, a 15-year-old amateur, outscored Woods by three here. </p> \n<p>After what seems an inevitable missed cut on the outskirts of Seattle, it would be no real surprise if Woods opts to take another break from tournament play. Despite his positive comment to the contrary, there is no evidence whatsoever that Woods can threaten, let alone dominate, leaderboards. Woods has more rounds in the 80s during this season than the 60s. Some form of reassessment is required. </p> \n<p>Prior to Thursday, his highest-scoring single US Open round was 77; that was as an amateur in 1996. Chambers Bay witnessed the fourth highest round of Woods’s professional career. To his credit, and in a departure from what plenty others would do in the same lamentable scenario, a sanguine Woods faced the media thereafter. He had just produced a back nine of 41. </p> \n<p>“I’m not very happy, that’s for sure,” said the 39-year-old. “It was a tough day. I got off to a bad start and then just couldn’t quite get it turned around.</p> \n<p>“It’s one of those things, just got to work through it. I’m trying as hard as I can to do it, and for some reason I just can’t get the consistency that I’d like to have out there.</p> \n<p>“I fought, I fought hard. And that was my number. I couldn’t grind out any harder than that. So that’s just the way I played and unfortunately it was a high number today.”</p> \n<p>Woods admitted this is as challenging a period as he has ever encountered. His solution? “Keep working. Keep grinding and keep working.”</p> \n<p>The 13th hole at Chambers Bay has the widest fairway in US Open history; Woods missed it. He triple bogeyed the 14th. Earlier, at the 8th, his club flew into the air from his hands as he played from wild rough. The 16th witnessed his solitary birdie. </p> \n<p>There was also a smile. If Woods’s score wasn’t a shock, the 81 of Rickie Fowler, one of his playing partners, certainly was. “The bright side is, at least I kicked Rickie’s butt today,” Woods said. That sense of humour has never been more necessary. </p> \n<p>Fowler has been the model of recent major championship consistency and was many people’s tip to claim this event.

The Bulls had a formidable record then, winning 91.6% of home games against Australian and New Zealand sides going back five years. The Brumbies <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/28/act-brumbies-bulls-super-rugby-match-report\">rolled</a> them 26-23. And Stephen Larkham’s side should have every confidence of repeating the road dog trick at Newlands.</p> \n<p>But there is a significant proviso: the Brumbies will have to use their potent backline weapons far more effectively, and more often. </p> \n<p>In fact, one could argue the Brumbies have struggled this season to find the right balance between kicking, forward carries and backline attacking play. A lot of this is down to former coach Jake White’s legacy of hardwiring players to punt anything and everything inside their own half. </p> \n<p>The Brumbies are a well-drilled enough side that they can put together winning seasons with this approach. But be that as it may, finals are a sudden death one-off event, and the Brumbies’ predictable approach has yet to deliver them a title, even though they’ve been rated strong contenders since their 2013 revival.</p> \n<p>The tragedy for Brumbies supporters is that their team has a backline that could be every bit as good as the Hurricanes’ and Waratahs’– but only if they disavow Jake-ball once and for all. </p> \n<p>It’s time to let the likes of Joe Tomane, Tevita Kuridrani, Henry Speight and Jessie Mogg have a crack from wherever their instincts tell them to. In fact, it’s a wonder the Brumbies don’t flip their game upside down – that is, run from inside their own half, and put up contestable kicks in the opposition half so as to exploit opportunities for what is the best line-out driving maul in the competition.</p> \n<p>The Brumbies came close to knocking off the Stormers at Newlands barely a month ago, going down 25-24 in a stop-start snorefest. Hopefully, coach Larkham would have heeded the lesson dished out by the Crusaders last week – you actually have to play rugby to win against the good sides. (As an aside, the Crusaders must be ruing their early season wobbles as in the form they were in last week, only a brave soul would bet against them snaring an eighth title.)</p> \n<p>The Brumbies have an excellent chance of winning this weekend if they run the ball. The Stormers don’t like being run around the park. Of their five losses this season, four have come against teams who shift the ball – the Cheetahs, Hurricanes, Highlanders, and Chiefs. There’s a lesson there, which if heeded could bode well for the travelling Brumbies. And, if all else fails, the Brumbies still have that man David Pocock who remains the bogeyman of all South African sides since the controversial 2011 Rugby World Cup Australia vs South Africa quarter-final. Pocock could simply spook the Stormers in the end just like he did to the Boks that day.</p> \n<h2><strong>Will the Highlanders magic run continue?</strong></h2> \n<p>Everyone loves the Highlanders, even the bagmen who have them short favourites against the 2012-13 champions the Chiefs in the first qualifying final on Saturday afternoon. It’s hard to disagree. The Highlanders have been magnificent this season and an absolute joy to watch, especially their world class backline starring All Black trio Ben and Aaron Smith, and Malakai Fekitoa. Then there are the Fijian flyers Patrick Osbourne and Waisake Naholo on the wings, and the soon-to-be All Black Lima Sopoaga pulling the strings at fly-half. It would appear many have the Highlanders pegged as good things given then have already beaten the Chiefs this season, 36-9 in round 16. However, that score is deceptive as Chiefs’ key big men Brodie Retallick and Matt Symons were out. That second-row combination is back, as are Sonny Bill Williams and Tim Nanai-Williams in the midfield. The Dunedin clash should go down to the wire. One suspects as good as the Highlanders’ backline is, their no-name forwards might struggle against a Chiefs pack with tackling machines Sam Cane, Liam Messam and Retallick coming into All Black form.</p> \n<h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Super Rugby Qualifying Finals</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Saturday</strong> </p> \n<p>Highlanders v Chiefs – 5.35pm (AEST)</p> \n<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p> \n<p>Stormers v Brumbies – 1.05am<br /></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e670103a9923e91c5acbab6d3d99b5f3cae79955/0_284_4928_2958/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2958,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lukas Coch/AAP","altText":"David Pocock","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T02:26:47Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T02:54:43Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[{"name":"Rajiv Maharaj","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rajiv-maharaj"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Super Rugby","Rugby union","Sport","Australia sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/super-rugby","webTitle":"Super Rugby"},{"id":"sport/rugby-union","webTitle":"Rugby union"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rajiv Maharaj","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rajiv-maharaj"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/19/brumbies-must-exorcise-the-ghost-of-jake-white-to-beat-stormers","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avjk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jun/19/brumbies-must-exorcise-the-ghost-of-jake-white-to-beat-stormers","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/19/brumbies-must-exorcise-the-ghost-of-jake-white-to-beat-stormers"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e670103a9923e91c5acbab6d3d99b5f3cae79955/0_284_4928_2958/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2958,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The fitness and form of David Pocock could prove vital to the Brumbies, if they are to upset the Stormers at home.
