In <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/running-with-the-pack-2.html\">his book on the subject</a><em>,</em> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/mar/04/whats-the-point-in-running\">Mark Rowlands</a> complains that most books about running reframe this question in terms of what use it has. We run because it keeps us healthy, reduces stress or brings us joy. We run for the satisfaction of a personal best or for the thrill of the race. We run to meet new people, to be part of a team or to impress the opposite sex. All of us will at some point have explained our pastime in such terms. But Rowlands argues that running, at its best, is valuable for what it is in itself, not for what it gives us. In other words, we run just because. And this is an idea that comes naturally to the novelist.<br /></p> \n<p>When the reform-school boy in Alan Sillitoe’s The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner throws away a race against a rival school, he does so not only to deny glory to the institution he detests, but because to win – even to finish – would be to undermine what he’s come to learn is the true value of running. “You had to run, run, run, without knowing why you were running,” he says. “This feeling was the only honesty and realness there was in the world.” For once, he’s doing something that is not done for the sake of something or someone else. </p> \n<p>The following five novels are recommended as portraits of a runner’s life, as well as for being forceful reminders that running, at its best, is something we do for its own sake. </p> \n<h2><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Running-A-Novel-Jean-Echenoz/dp/1595584730\"><strong>Running</strong><strong> </strong></a><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Running-A-Novel-Jean-Echenoz/dp/1595584730\">by Jean Echenoz</a> (translated. by Linda Coverdale)</strong><br /></p></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c4Z8cbcIiA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3c4Z8cbcIiA?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Emil Zatopek on his way to triple glory\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jean Echenoz’s fictionalised biography of the “Czech Locomotive” Emil Z&aacute;topek tells of his transformation from an unenthusiastic, uncompetitive child into the “superhuman” athlete who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c4Z8cbcIiA\">won the 5,000m, 10,000m and the marathon at the Helsinki Olympics</a> of 1952. There is enough training-based detail here to please the club runner: Echenoz doesn’t ignore Z&aacute;topek the maverick, “ignoring every time-honoured rule” to pioneer the interval session or to “invent” the sprint finish. But this is a historically engaged novel about how sport can become entangled with politics; a story driven by the tension between individual freedom and political constraint. Echenoz does a brilliant job of picturing an athlete whose activities and public persona were constantly influenced by outside forces – from the unassuming child who is forced into cross country by Nazi occupiers in Zl&iacute;n to the showboating “athlete of the state”. The most convincing of these is not the Bolt-like athlete who couldn’t lose – “living proof of the wonders of socialism” – but the man who, at the end of his career,<em> </em>is still running, even while confronting the prospect of irreversible decline.<br /></p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/running-the-rift.html\"><strong>Running the Rift </strong><strong>by Naomi Benaron</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8c5re3akM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xW8c5re3akM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Naomi Benaron reads from Running the Rift.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Set in Rwanda, Naomi Benaron’s Running the Rift is another novel whose narrative is propelled by a clash between athletics and politics. It follows Jean-Patrick, a promising young Tutsi runner who, growing up, seems destined for the Olympics. Amid the political instability of the early 1990s, Jean-Patrick’s talent and determination allow him to “barter a future with his legs and his sweat and his pain”. But, as it did for Z&aacute;topek, success threatens to come only at the cost of losing his identity. As the conflict between Hutus and Tutsis escalates, running is made difficult by the curfews, road blocks and patrols, and Jean-Patrick comes to appreciate the true importance of putting one foot in front of the other (“Only when he ran ... could he sort out these problems that went round and round in his head”). Running is no longer a way of life, but a luxury. Soon after, it becomes a necessity: when the genocide strikes, Jean-Patrick finds himself, quite literally, bartering a future with his legs, his sweat and his pain.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/other-3.html\"><strong>The Other</strong><strong> </strong><strong>by David Guterson</strong></a></h2> \n<p>Guterson’s novel begins with a brilliantly perceptive account of a half-mile race: “approximately two minutes of self-mortification and private crucifixion”. Few who’ve had the misfortune of running an 800m race would disagree with this. Nor are they likely to question the narrator’s description of the 800m runner: “They want to do battle with suffering. It’s the trauma they want, the anguished ordeal.” It is fitting that a novel about masochism taken to an extreme should begin with an 800m race. In The Other, running – and the pain that accompanies it – is an important means of escape: from child abuse, from romantic rejection, from the pressure to fit in, but above all from the “hamburger world” of late capitalism. Guterson’s novel shows how our need for ritual suffering must be contained. The alternative, played out in the narrative of The Other, is a literal escape from civilisation – an austere life in the woods even less appealing than an 800m race.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/brewster-2.html\"><strong>Brewster </strong><strong>by Mark Slouka</strong></a></h2> \n<p>Does it matter? This is a question that haunts Jon Mosher, the high-school athlete at the centre of Mark Slouka’s coming-of-age novel set in the US in the late 1960s. With everything going on – alongside the personal crises that drive the book’s narrative, the Vietnam draft is a constant and frightening presence – Jon can be forgiven for questioning the importance of running. However, intoxicated by numbers, split times and the thrill of the race, he remains willing to put himself through any kind of torture to remain in the team. Slouka’s descriptions of high-school track races are unrivalled in their resonance and beauty; these passages capture everything from “the air thick with heat rub” to the deadly elegance of the elite runner, progressing through the field “like a scythe going through grass – gorgeous, ruthless”. Slouka does a brilliant job of making the reader understand Jon’s decision to stick at it. In Brewster, running is not so much about catharsis and escape, but about creating valuable shared experiences and memories. “For those three minutes and 20 seconds,” Jon says after victory in the mile relay, “it felt like it mattered.”</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Once-Runner-John-Jr-Parker/dp/1416597891\"><strong>Once a Runner</strong><strong> </strong><strong>by John L Parker Jr</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7QFjd-oUec\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7QFjd-oUec?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In 1978, having failed to find a publisher for Once a Runner, John L Parker Jr began selling the book at road races from the boot of his car. It quickly became a favourite among those club runners lucky enough to get their hands on a copy. Now widely available, Once a Runner should be prescribed to any runner who trains hard – or who <em>thinks </em>they do. Quenton Cassidy is a damagingly committed miler whose success comes at the cost of permanent fatigue, crumbling relationships and a lifestyle similar to that of a cloistered monk. In the book’s most memorable passage, he completes a brutal session of 60 x 400m reps. Parker Jr’s prose is convincing enough to leave the reader feeling inadequate yet strangely motivated. But Once a Runner<em> </em>gives fair warning to anyone looking to dive into a training routine like Cassidy’s. At a party towards the end of the novel, he has a moment of self-revelation that will resonate with anyone who has trained for an endurance event: “It occurred to him that he was a pretty dull guy.” So, why do it? Cassidy admits he has no adequate response to this, but there’s something in the breathless energy and enthusiasm of Once a Runner that points to the answer: we do it just because.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434548937388/9d9f5a2e-41f3-4235-b095-d6575cf69dc8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images","altText":"Emil Zátopek in 1947 after a successful five-mile cross-country race.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T07:07:57Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T07:12:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Books","Life and style","Running","Athletics"],"tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/running","webTitle":"Running"},{"id":"sport/athletics","webTitle":"Athletics"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/18/five-novels-every-runner-should-read","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49mm7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/18/five-novels-every-runner-should-read","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/18/five-novels-every-runner-should-read"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434548937388/9d9f5a2e-41f3-4235-b095-d6575cf69dc8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Emil Zátopek in 1947 after a successful five-mile cross-country race.

The Maroons still have some of the best players of the modern era. Johnathan Thurston was a constant threat at the G, as was a rejuvenated Greg Inglis who, in full flight, is worthy of commentary by David Attenborough; but time passes just as hair greys, muscles weaken and a night in on Saturday evening seems an enticing proposition - and the gap between the two sides continues to close. It could be that Origin titles will soon be shared more equitably, just like in the old days. Pre-2006, that is.</p> \n<p>There were periods during Wednesday night’s game, of course, when Queensland looked as if they’d hold firm, such as when, following Matt Gillett’s try, they gained the lead for the first time early in the second half and then stretched it out to 18-14 after a Thurston penalty goal in the 56th minute. Steered about by Cameron Smith, who has the eye of a sextant, Queensland are a team that knows how to win from in front, how to see out a game. <br />But then, 11 minutes later, the game’s best forward, Aaron Woods, burst through the Queensland goal-line defence like Sasquatch through the shrubbery and NSW were back in front in what had become an exciting game of claim and counter-claim, a fitting spectacle for what was a record Origin crowd anywhere, let alone one held in a foreign capital and in a stadium that resonates with the history of an entirely different football game. </p> \n<p>Despite Woods’ try Queensland could yet have won it, and so nearly did. But Inglis, Queensland, and future compilers of highlight reels, were denied a try that would have put the Maroons back in front with just over 10 minutes remaining. It took some guts for the officials to overrule it, for Inglis’ booming 90m run was a stained-glass window in Melbourne’s mightiest cathedral, but they had reason to be concerned with the tackle on Mitchell Pearce that preceded it. </p> \n<p>If Michael Morgan hadn’t knocked the ball on as he reefed it out of Pearce’s arm (and that was the official ruling), the loose ball did appear to hit the boot of Gillett and go forward to Inglis who might have been ruled accidentally offside. Still, it was a tough call on Queensland that had a massive bearing on the result. But what is rugby league these days but a series of tight calls poured over and over again to the satisfaction of no-one, despite the fact that the alternative would lead to just as much controversy? </p> \n<p>Of course it was only minutes earlier that NSW felt cheated themselves after Pearce was denied what looked a certain try. After some excellent broken field running by the rat-quick Michael Jennings —who had Queensland’s fragile right-side defence jumping on chairs all evening— Brett Morris’ final pass to Pearce was ruled to have been forward. It looked flat at worst. NSW should have been eight points ahead, and if Back to the Future taught us anything it’s that this would have altered the space time continuum, meaning Inglis’ ‘try’ would never have happened. NSW may have won in more comfort fashion than they did.</p> \n<p>So both sides had cause for gripes but it spoke volumes that NSW showed they had the stomach, and the vigour, to win from behind with the series on the line. The try to Woods and then, in the 70th minute, to Josh Dugan running a good line off Trent Hodkinson, came off the back of NSW’s superior forward power. Four of the Blues’ starting forwards carried the ball over 100m (with Woods leading the way with 147m, followed by Hoffman, Gallen and Tamou) compared to just one Queensland forward, Corey Parker (126m). It’s still true that NSW’s halves lack the creativity of their counterparts —although Daly Cherry-Evans has yet to prove he’s anywhere near the level of Cooper Cronk, who was sorely missed by the Maroons— but it’s in the forwards NSW have the edge, and when their forwards can get on top, as they did on Wednesday night, it makes life easier for Hodkinson and Pearce, and gives room to the likes of Jennings, Brett Morris and Dugan.</p> \n<p>If Wednesday night’s game showed us that the gap between the sides is narrowing it also reminded us that Origin does not need punch-ups to entertain — which isn’t to say we should pretend to be horrified that they ever took place, or shouldn’t lament their passing, however guiltily. Despite Gallen lighting the flame in the build-up, their were no pyrotechnics, apart from the one’s before the replaced the traditional rock-band-on-a-podium thing. </p> \n<p>Apart from a Justin Hodges swinging arm on Ryan Hoffman’s chin, the closest we came to a stink was after Slater threw the ball at James Tamou in retaliation to Tamou resting both his hands on Slater’s face, as if he were moulding wet clay or trying to identify Slater by using his hands as eyes. As the two shaped up to each other players flew into the fray like metal filings into a magnet, but fists remained in their holsters, and they did so all night.</p> \n<p>Perhaps some were disappointed that that was the case but the game offered plenty else to remind us that Origin still has a lot more to offer. And that the Blues are inexorably regaining a foothold in the contest.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/484e0661172b37b02a455f4b451a7493431b1129/0_0_3666_2201/3666.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2201,"width":3666,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Julian Smith/AAP","altText":"Aaron Woods celebrates","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Julian Smith/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T00:38:57Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T04:24:12Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":47,"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Connolly","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/paul-connolly"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["State of Origin","NRL","Rugby league","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/state-of-origin","webTitle":"State of Origin"},{"id":"sport/nrl","webTitle":"NRL"},{"id":"sport/rugbyleague","webTitle":"Rugby league"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paul Connolly","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/paul-connolly"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/18/game-ii-state-of-origin-wrapup","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49qtj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/18/game-ii-state-of-origin-wrapup","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/18/game-ii-state-of-origin-wrapup"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/484e0661172b37b02a455f4b451a7493431b1129/0_0_3666_2201/3666.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2201,"width":3666,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Blues prop Aaron Woods celebrate after State of Origin II between the NSW Blues and Queensland Maroons at the MCG.

Shortly afterwards, Gallacher’s bag man Damien Moore fell when walking in rough on the 6th hole and twisted an ankle. Moore’s prospects of appearing for day one at the US Open are regarded as slim after a protective cast was placed on the injury.</p> \n<p>Lord and Moore are two of the most experienced and respected caddies in top-level golf. Their incidents highlight what has perhaps been an unacknowledged danger of Chambers Bay; scorched grasses and slopes mean precarious territory for caddies and spectators alike. The caddie fraternity is unlikely to take a positive view towards the US Open set-up, which will place significant physical demands upon them.</p> \n<p>Stenson was quick to acknowledge such problems. The Swede said: “It’s tricky out there. You’ve got to be careful. You see that yellow grass laying down? It’s dangerous.”</p> \n<p>Stenson told golfweek.com that he had witnessed a particularly bad fall by a scorer during a practice round at the start of US Open week. Unlike players, caddies don’t wear spiked footwear, a move taken to protect greens but which raises questions on weeks such as these.</p> \n<p>Gallacher’s management firm paid tribute to the medical assistance and back-up options provided by the USGA. A local caddie has been placed on standby for the Scottish Ryder Cup player, who is due to begin his US Open quest at 2.39pm local time on Thursday.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434615107477/U.S.-Open---Preview-Day-3-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Henrik Stenson has branded Chambers Bay 'dangerous' after two caddies were injured on the US Open course.

In US rugby these days he is indeed something of a big deal, and he explained his presence at Satow Stadium in New York City, the home of Columbia University’s Ivy League champion baseball team. It was to do with cones, drills and running. Coaching, in other words.</p> \n<p>Greening was on his way back to London; he had come from Cary, North Carolina, where on Sunday he helped the US men’s Eagles sevens team beat Canada and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/usa-beat-canada-rio-olympics-rugby-sevens\">qualify for next year’s Rio Olympic Games</a>.</p> \n<p>Asked how he, fellow assistant Chris Brown, a Kiwi, and another Englishman, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/12/usa-rugby-nacra-sevens-olympic-games-canada\">head coach Mike Friday</a>, had turned the Eagles from world series relegation contenders into <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/17/usa-win-london-sevens-rugby-australia\">London Sevens champions</a> and Rio qualifiers, Greening offered an interesting line of thought. Much of the US men’s success, he said, was down to a cultural shift away from a more “American”, top-down or even dictatorial way of coaching.</p> \n<p>“The pool of players haven’t changed that much, although we found a couple,” he said – in the background <a href=\"http://www.thisisamericanrugby.com/2015/05/video-nate-augspurger-hat-trick-against.html\">scrum-half Nate Augspurger</a>, one of those finds, ran drills – “and I think the fundamentals that we’ve built on were present.</p> \n<p>“The conditioning and the collision fitness we brought in helped, but me and Mike we’ve watched the US teams for years and we’ve known there’s talent there.”</p> \n<p>He came to the point: “It was tough at the start, because two English guys coming in and a Kiwi sort of upset a lot of people, especially the players ’cause some of them thought we were mad. We had a few battles because there’s a different culture over here, and a different way to coach.<br /></p> \n<p>“I think our coaching is not the standard way over here, there’s a different way to coach in America. Correct me if I’m wrong, but it seems very much a ‘tell’ culture, where the coach is king. We ripped that apart and I think that was maybe difficult for the boys to understand. But we got there.”</p> \n<p>Greening described a squad full of crossovers from football, such as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/oct/03/carlin-isles-us-eagles-olympics-sevens-world-series\">Carlin Isles</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/feb/13/usa-sevens-rugby-perry-baker-eagles-arena-football\">Perry Baker</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/15/zack-test-usa-eagles-london-sevens-rugby\">Zack Test</a>, and homegrown rugby talents such as Augspurger, Danny Barrett and Garrett Bender, taking responsibility for their actions. This happened in earnest, he said, in the aftermath of a 40-0 defeat by Canada in Glasgow in May.</p> \n<p>“The wake-up call in Scotland was massive. We were terrible in that game, really off, and we had to find out why. That night we had a team meeting, an honesty session. We said to the lads, ‘You need to step up, because me and Mike we haven’t got all the answers.’ And they talked it out and day two they turned up and were a lot better. We went from there.</p> \n<p>“It’s an open and honest environment now. We can challenge each other. The penny’s dropped and they’re starting to get their rewards for their hard work.”</p> \n<p>As evidence for this improvement Greening cited, among other things, Test’s move into the forwards and Isles’ hugely improved defence, particularly in gaining crucial turnovers in <a href=\"http://www.thisisamericanrugby.com/2015/06/video-nacra-7s-final-full-match-replay.html\">the Nacra final</a> despite the Canadians “wanting to run big boys at him all day”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-80cb5b90-cf0d-4186-a120-4cb000000f58\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434549294349/f3f4f78a-e820-4a17-9e20-bc41b030a9f6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Phil Greening\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Phil Greening, centre, sings the anthem before facing France for England at Twickenham in 2001.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason O'Brien/Action Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Hard work remains to be done, of course, in the run-up to Rio.

Recruits from Oklahoma, Dartmouth and Arkansas State tried out on a muggy night at the top of Manhattan, all under the gaze of coaches Steve Lewis and <a href=\"http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=11443790\">Marty Veale</a>, the former a transplanted Scot, the latter once a second row for North Harbour, Northland and Wasps. Greening, who played sevens for England at the 2002 Commonweath Games and in a Hong Kong-winning squad, moved his cones about, discussed the likelihood of US success attracting more young athletes to rugby, and raised a final point.</p> \n<p>World Series sevens teams run full-time squads. Asked about Canada’s decision to bring in Europe-based 15-a-side pros for the Olympic qualifier, which the US mirrored with the selection of the Saracens back Chris Wyles, Greening mused on the likelihood of New Zealand, guaranteed gold medal contenders in Rio, selecting 15-a-side All Blacks such as the lethal wing <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gPokUkVC7A0\">Julian Savea</a>.</p> \n<p>“I think physically we could match that kind of player with the guys we have,” he said. </p> \n<p>Looking at the way the Eagles dominated England and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZCxavDy2gw\">Australia</a> in London, not many would argue with that.</p> \n<p>“But it’s the knowledge and the understanding of the game that they have that we have got to match.
