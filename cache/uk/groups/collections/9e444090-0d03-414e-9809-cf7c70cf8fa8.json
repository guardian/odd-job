But after his last-minute field-goal to kill off the Raiders in Canberra, it’s affirmed yet again: when you absolutely, positively need someone to kick a field goal for your life on the death, accept no substitute for Johnathan Thurston. For when everyone else is running about, frothing, leaping, yelling, possessed as if by demons, you want the ball with Thurston. How about him? The man’s a stone killer. The ability to rip off high skill at high speed under pressure both physical – huge men running at you with violent intent – and mental – miss and you don’t win – only a select few human beings are capable of this. And Thurston’s options under the pump are best practice in this National Rugby League. And as a Raiders fan, allow me to add, the bastard.</p> \n<h2><strong>Bird Man of Auckland</strong></h2> \n<p> When Shaun Johnson is shredding D-lines with that particular blend of sneaky feet and eyes like a bird’s that can see many directions, all at once, as it’s well known that birds can, it says so in SoundslikesomethingIheardapedia, then rugby league is a happy place. See him against the Gold Coast Titans, frightening lumbering forwards with pace, and a step like a claw hammer tossed down your granddad’s concrete driveway. (Ha.) Johnson’s problem and the Warriors’ problem and by dint the country of New Zealand’s problem, is that next week he could as likely be lost and lonely as a cloud, and his team flogged by Canberra in Auckland. Why is it so? Even enigmatic <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Sumner_Miller\">Professor Julius Sumner Miller</a> couldn’t have told you. Probably.</p> \n<h2><strong>Playas</strong></h2> \n<p> When coaches and CEOs and influential men of league gather to talk seriously of the important elements of a premiership-winning season, they talk mostly of men. Of players. And the need the acquire the right ones. Coaches and ancillary staff are important. But players are key. Get the best ones you can, fit and firing at the right time of year, keep them motivated and off the drink (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/state-of-origin-michael-jennings-charged\"><em>no</em>, Micky Jennings, <em>naughty</em> Micky Jennings</a>) then you give yourself the best possible chance. Look at our premiers the last five years, run through their roster. Best (fit, playing) players equals best results. It’s almost that simple. And it’s for this reason Penrith can’t win the 2015 NRL premiership. Last year they went all-but with an injury list that could’ve lined up in games. But this year they’re bashed up more than an entire series of MASH in which Hawkeye and Radar and Hot Lips Hoolihan and the one who dressed in women’s clothing to get a psyche certificate and get the hell out of Korea have to deal with fresh new casualties, with new stories, and very real human emotion, each week. And with James Segeyaro being carried off to join Brent Kite, Jamal Idris and Matt Moylan, sad to say because they’re plucky and tough but it’s over for Penrith Panthers. Over like tattoos and hipster beards will be soon enough.</p> \n<h2><strong>Great Wall of Brisbane</strong></h2> \n<p> The balance of the Brisbane Broncos best XVII has a tasty look about it. Halfback Ben Hunt has skills and smarts. Five-eighth Anthony Milford is hot-footed and fast and has more tricks than Mandrake. And fullback Darius Boyd has been sluicing about behind the backline since 2006, an elite player if not media performer. But now, with the giant shadow of Wayne Bennett looming large like a wraith, say, or an electric blanket the size of Suncorp, the Broncos have mettle. Desperate mettle, the best kind. And they defend like Spartans waiting for the mad ninja hordes of Xerses to attack them through one small gap in a cliff-top. The Broncs are super-fit and go hard, and forwards Adam Blair, Matt Gillett, Josh McGuire, Alex Glenn and Sam Thaiday just go and go. And go again. And again. See them against Melbourne Storm. McGuire made 50 tackles. Gillett made 54 tackles. Hooker Andrew McCullough made <em>64</em> tackles. The Storm were missing two of their Big Three but with that weight of possession would have beaten most everyone else. But Brisbane erected a human wall of man-meat. And got the biscuits in Melbourne.</p> \n<h2><strong>Beasts and bottom feeders</strong></h2> \n<p> Elsewhere the Dragons and Roosters proved they’re chock-full of hard-acres well prepared for the attritional style of semi-finals rugby league. Both teams’ defensive tenet is hit and be hit, and do it again. That the Chooks did it without the game’s number one beast Jared Waerea-Hargraves will give them plenty of pep in the step heading into September. It’s a month Manly fans would’ve been preparing to holiday in Ballina, say, or Gladstone, even Port Augusta, just a few weeks ago. But the Sea Eagles looked hard and fast at Brookvale Friday night, and if they can keep their star halves fit and on the field, they’re … well. They’re still last. But their odds to win the premiership are now 33-1, while their fellow bottom dwellers the Titans, Tigers, Eels and Knights are 100-1 and worse. And lastly Cronulla beat Newcastle by two points, and Luke Lewis scored a fine try in which he touched the ball twice in the movement and ran like the winger he was in 1983. And good luck to him. </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/64280c4b54165d094796202a094829ff58b5ac7b/0_489_3280_1969/3280.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1969,"width":3280,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lukas Coch/AAP","altText":"Johnathan Thurston was again the hero for the Cowboys against the Raiders at GIO Stadium in Canberra.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T00:48:14Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T00:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":11,"contributors":[{"name":"Matt Cleary","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/9/30/1412086616318/Matt-Cleary-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/matt-cleary"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["NRL","North Queensland Cowboys","New Zealand Warriors","Penrith Panthers","Brisbane Broncos","Rugby league","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/nrl","webTitle":"NRL"},{"id":"sport/north-queensland-cowboys","webTitle":"North Queensland Cowboys"},{"id":"sport/new-zealand-warriors","webTitle":"New Zealand Warriors"},{"id":"sport/penrith-panthers","webTitle":"Penrith Panthers"},{"id":"sport/brisbane-broncos","webTitle":"Brisbane Broncos"},{"id":"sport/rugbyleague","webTitle":"Rugby league"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Matt Cleary","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/matt-cleary"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/23/nrl-five-things-learned-round-15","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a358","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jun/23/nrl-five-things-learned-round-15","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/23/nrl-five-things-learned-round-15"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/64280c4b54165d094796202a094829ff58b5ac7b/0_489_3280_1969/3280.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1969,"width":3280,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Johnathan Thurston was again the hero for the Cowboys against the Raiders at GIO Stadium in Canberra.

Berryman died on Tuesday of a heart attack in Australia, where he has been based for several years.</p> \n<p>A father of six, he had recently worked as a forklift driver in Perth, where he had also played club rugby. Umaga and others expressed shock and sadness at the passing of Berryman, who will be remembered for a flamboyant attacking style and laid-back approach off the field.</p> \n<p>A decade-long career through the 1990s included three seasons with the Crusaders, where he won three Super Rugby titles from 1998-2000. He also represented the Chiefs and Blues. Berryman’s lone Test appearance was off the reserves bench in a 24-23 loss to South Africa in 1998.</p> \n<p>“He always had a big smile,” Umaga said. “He loved life, loved his family, he’ll be a big loss. It’s a life lost too young.”</p> \n<p>Umaga was constantly amazed by Berryman’s ability to scythe through defences, belying a physique which was wider of girth than most of his peers, and admits he was embarrassed more than once defensively when the pair locked horns at provincial and Super Rugby level.</p> \n<p>“There were probably a few times where he beat me on the outside, the inside, upside-down, I’m not too sure. He was that good with his footwork. He had amazing skills for a big man.”</p> \n<p>“Stormin” Norman Berryman, as many supporters knew him, represented New Zealand Maori across an 11-year span and finished his playing career with short stints at French clubs Castres and Bourgoin.</p> \n<p>Berryman’s death follows that of another recent former All Black, Jerry Collins, who died in a car accident in France this month. Collins’s wife was also killed and their baby daughter remains on life support.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435039130900/b0acea7a-838f-4d54-a91f-ef2337218b10-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave Rogers/Getty Images Sport","altText":"Norm Berryman ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave Rogers/Getty Images Sport"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T06:01:15Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T06:01:15Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Rugby union","Australia sport","Sport","New Zealand rugby union team"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/rugby-union","webTitle":"Rugby union"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/new-zealand-rugby-union-team","webTitle":"New Zealand rugby union team"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/rugby-tributes-flow-for-norm-berryman","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a37v","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/23/rugby-tributes-flow-for-norm-berryman","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/23/rugby-tributes-flow-for-norm-berryman"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435039130900/b0acea7a-838f-4d54-a91f-ef2337218b10-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Norm Berryman, pictured playing in a Heineken Cup match for Castres in 2002.
