It looked to be a familiar tale for the bottom club as they fell 16-0 behind after conceding tries to Kirk Yeaman, Jordan Rankin and Liam Watts inside the first 17 minutes.</p> \n<p>But they hit back with four unanswered tries of their own through Jacob Miller, Richard Owen, Joe Arundel and Matty Ryan to win 26-16, their first league success since February.</p> \n<p>“There is a lot of relief in there,” said Smith, who was in charge of his third match. “There’s been a lot of people working for that, chiseling away and trying to get over the hump for 16 games.</p> \n<p>“ The players have been working hard to get there and they had to work the hardest way, coming from 16-0 down but they did it well in the end.</p> \n<p>We were very disappointing in those early minutes and I think I’ve got to look at myself and what I’m doing there because that’s three really sluggish starts in a row.”</p> \n<p>“So I need to review it with Stuey [Dickens] and Lee [Gilmour] and the other staff to see if we can work out a different way to start a game because that is the hardest way to play football. For a team that’s down on confidence to concede tries as softly as we did and then come back is like running uphill the whole game.”</p> \n<p>Former New Zealand international full-back Kevin Locke, one of three debutants, was named the sponsors’ man of the match but he agreed with his coach that the award flattered him.</p> \n<p>Locke, who joined the Wildcats on a short-term deal after securing a release from his unhappy time at Salford, struggled at times in his first match for two months but played a key role in two of Wakefield’s tries.</p> \n<p>Smith added: “I spoke to Kev after the game and told him they had named him man of the match and he said ’wait until I’m fit’.</p> \n<p>“He had some nice touches but Kevin was well off his game at times tonight and understandably so.</p> \n<p>“It’s been a terribly emotional time for him, it’s been a big drain on him but he’s got a smile back on his face. Hopefully we can keep him in a really positive environment and he can continue to improve his game.</p> \n<p>“His knee is not his problem it’s just general fitness and sharpness.”</p> \n<p>While Wakefield remain rooted to the foot of the table, still seven points adrift of Salford, they will head for the run-in in buoyant mood, starting with a return game against Hull at the KC Stadium on Sunday.</p> \n<p>That is now a must-win fixture for Hull, who missed the chance to climb out of the bottom four, just a week after crashing out of the Challenge Cup in dismal fashion.</p> \n<p>“I’m deflated hugely,” Hull coach Lee Radford said. “We had highlighted the importance of this fixture and what a difficult this place is to come to. Our record at this ground is terrible. It’s always a dogfight here and I expected to scrape it if we were going to get a result.</p> \n<p>“But after that 15-minute period we didn’t give ourselves a chance to get any momentum back. Our completion rate was 60 per cent again. That’s two weeks on the spin now and that’s not good enough.</p> \n<p>“Our energy looked fine at the start but a couple of calls went against us, a couple of uncharacteristic mistakes and back-to-back penalties and before you know it the game has gone.”</p> \n<p>Hull also had prop Mickey Paea placed on report for a tackle that left former team-mate Danny Washbrook concussed but Radford does not expect any repercussions.</p> \n<p>“He has got nothing whatsoever to worry about, there was nothing in it,” Radford said. “He’s not gone over the horizontal and Washy hurt his head on the floor.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435793641418/Wakefield-Trinity-Wildcat-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jacob Miller scores one of Wakefield's four unanswered tries to help his team fight back to win 26-16.

If anyone needed a reminder of why high-calibre crosses change games, this was it.</p> \n<p>Under acute pressure from two attackers, Bassett attempted to clear but merely succeeded in forcing the ball over Karen Bardsley’s head before watching in horror as it grazed the underside of the bar and dropped a yard over the line.</p> \n<p>As tears began rolling down Bassett’s face, the final whistle blew. Instantly the centre half was engulfed by team-mates desperate to offer her a consolatory hug.</p> \n<p>Bassett and the rest of Sampson’s squad must travel back to London via Saturday’s third place playoff against Germany, while Japan will face USA in the following day’s denouement.</p> \n<p>Prince William and David Cameron had been at the front of the queue of well wishers sending the Lionesses good luck messages on Wednesday, but Norio Sasaki was not convinced.</p> \n<p>“There are places where England fall unintentionally apart,” said Japan’s coach, somewhat sniffily, shortly before kick off. “I wonder how they have been so successful so far?”</p> \n<p>Shortly after kickoff, Jodie Taylor looked set to ruffle his confidence after connecting with Karen Bardsley’s long kick – but she directed her volley slightly off target.</p> \n<p>After that, much of the first half was all about Japan dominating possession, with the Lionesses struggling to second-guess Aya Miyami’s midfield promptings and sometimes wrongfooted by the classy Rumi Utsugi.</p> \n<p>The good news for Sampson was that the <em>Nadeshiko</em> struggled to get behind a supremely well organised defence, and Bardsley was barely troubled. Indeed, on admittedly rare counter-attacks invariably featuring long balls, Jill Scott and Taylor, the Lionesses looked reasonably threatening.</p> \n<p>Everything changed when Claire Rafferty shoved Saori Ariyoshi just inside the area – England protested, forlornly, it was just outside – and Miayma stepped up to take the penalty. Despite delaying her kick and then stuttering in the run-up, she sent Bardsley the wrong way.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN57_OiHpqQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vN57_OiHpqQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  England coach Mark Sampson praises the team’s performance despite an injury-time own-goal by defender Laura Bassett which put Japan into the final of the Women’s World Cup\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If Sampson had a case for arguing that Rafferty’s inital push had been made marginally outside the area, he could have had no complaints when England – due &pound;35,000 per woman bonuses had they lifted the trophy – won a distinctly iffy penalty of their own. </p> \n<p>This time, Steph Houghton tumbled all too easy in the face of Yuki Ogimi’s challenge, but the referee bought it and Fara Williams stepped up to the spot. Sampson’s set-piece specialist did not let him down, her kick comfortably evading Ayumi Kaihori’s grasp.</p> \n<p>With Taylor’s knee – she had surgery only two months ago – forcing her replacement by Ellen White after an hour, Japan looked relieved. They appeared even more so as Toni Duggan’s shot rebounded off the bar.</p> \n<p>Sasaki introduced Mana Iwabuchi – aka “The Killer” – from the bench, and the creator dubbed “the brightest flower” of the Japanese women’s game promptly began causing England all sorts of problems as she ran through a repertoire of tricks. So many, indeed, that there was a strong suspicion that Sampson, ever streetwise, instructed Bardsley to fake an injury in order to use the break in play to re-group his Lionesses.</p> \n<p>No matter.

British Cycling has grown massively over the period in which Sky has been involved, with the WorldTour Team Sky spearheading the increase in the sport’s profile at the top of the sporting ladder, and Sky Rides – joint ventures between Sky, the governing body and local authorities – boosting participation at the grassroots.</p> \n<p>Sky, for their part, have enjoyed the immense profile benefits which follow when a backer comes in relatively early in the game. In Britain, cycling was not quite mature as a sport when the Murdoch money arrived; it is certainly mature now. One theory was that Sky the broadcaster wanted to sweeten its image by linking up with British Cycling and its riders; given the way that Team Sky continue to function as the Marmite team of professional cycling, that was probably over-optimistic.</p> \n<p>Intriguingly, the television company will continue to back the elite end of the sport through Team Sky and Team Wiggins – which some suggest will change into the feeder team for the WorldTour squad, unless they finds their own large‑scale cash backer in 2016. Which leads to the obvious question: where does the uncoupling leave the governing body? Since the arrival of Sky in July 2008, British Cycling, with Dave Brailsford the performance director, expanded rapidly – on the back of two hugely successful Olympic Games – swelling from about 60 employees to over 250, to the extent that it now occupies a large new office in the Manchester velodrome.</p> \n<p>Sky’s sponsorship amounts to an estimated annual &pound;2.5m in cash terms, or &pound;10m per four-year funding cycle, plus further support for other items such as the popular Sky Rides and administration and marketing. It is a significant amount but the bulk of British Cycling’s budget comes from the National Lottery via its Sport England grant and the Olympic team funding, which together amount to over &pound;60m per four-year funding cycle.</p> \n<p>Although it is only responsible for a relatively small proportion of British Cycling’s cash income, the formal end of the Sky deal is a respectable chunk of money which the governing body now has to seek in its own right, albeit Sky have said they will assist. This is not a new process, as in the knowledge that Sky would be unlikely to renew, British Cycling has been seeking a new backer for a while. Cycling is popular, and high profile, but big money does not follow automatically, as the experience of Tour of Britain organisers Sweetspot in gaining backing for the Women’s Tour last year demonstrates.</p> \n<p>Sky’s departurewill sharpen minds but is not a sign of impending doom. What it does do is to make the Olympic team’s results in Rio far more significant, because they will impact on funding for the next four-year cycle beginning in 2017. In 2014 the team met their milestone target of six to eight world championship medals in able-bodied sports; this year, with only three medals at the world track championships and no chance of Sir Bradley Wiggins landing a gold medal at the world road titles, landing half a dozen looks unlikely.</p> \n<p>The best indication of how British Cycling will hold up in Rio will not come until next year’s world track championships in London but what the governing body wants to avoid is a nightmare double-whammy where a replacement backer for Sky does not appear, or is dilatory in signing the deal, and the team miss their Rio target, resulting in a more substantial loss of funds.</p> \n<p>“This is a lasting legacy,” said Sky’s Jeremy Darroch on Wednesday; it is to be hoped that that is the case, but just how lasting – and in what form – will depend on whether British Cycling draws in a new backer, and whether the Olympic head Shane Sutton gets his team to perform in Rio. Both are works in progress; if either flops, the Sky years could come to seem like a golden age.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/1f0285a067436057d59d3959a683a53b85ea0157/0_938_8064_4836/8064.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4836,"width":8064,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Photosport Int/REX Shutterstock/Photosport Int/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Sir BradleyWiggins","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Photosport Int/REX Shutterstock/Photosport Int/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T18:34:12Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T23:00:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":8,"contributors":[{"name":"William Fotheringham","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/williamfotheringham"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Team Sky","Cycling","Dave Brailsford","Olympic Games 2016","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky"},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling"},{"id":"sport/dave-brailsford","webTitle":"Dave Brailsford"},{"id":"sport/olympic-games-2016","webTitle":"Olympic Games 2016"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"William Fotheringham","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/williamfotheringham"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/01/british-cycling-break-up-sky-rio-olympics","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aaec","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/01/british-cycling-break-up-sky-rio-olympics","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/01/british-cycling-break-up-sky-rio-olympics"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/1f0285a067436057d59d3959a683a53b85ea0157/0_938_8064_4836/8064.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4836,"width":8064,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The television company Sky will still back the elite end of the sport including Team Wiggo headed by Sir Bradley Wiggins.
