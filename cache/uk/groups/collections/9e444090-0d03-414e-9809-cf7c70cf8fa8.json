It will be amazing to put on another great show for them under the floodlights on the Friday night.”</p> \n<p>Bolt will run on the Friday night of the three-day meeting which runs from 24-26 July. Earlier this week Mo Farah also confirmed that he would run in the 3,000m on the Friday. Greg Rutherford and Jessica Ennis-Hill are among the athletes who will compete on the Saturday afternoon, while the Sunday will be devoted to Paralympic athletes.</p> \n<p>Bolt’s late decision to run in London was made only after George Osborne granted a tax exemption to foreign athletes competing at the event in the budget earlier this week. Usually they are liable for 50% tax on their appearance fee, plus a proportion of their worldwide earnings.</p> \n<p>It was for this reason that Bolt did not compete in London in 2010 or 2011, or the Diamond League meeting in Glasgow last year. However he did run in the first Anniversary Games in London in 2013 – where a similar tax break was granted – winning the 100m in 9.85sec.</p> \n<p>The Jamaican has struggled for fitness since 2013, and after missing much of last year, has raced only a handful of times this season. But while Bolt’s fastest 100m time of 10.12 sec this year puts him just 58th in the world ranking, while his 200m best of 20.13 puts him 13th in the standings, it is worth bearing in mind that the 29-year-old has raced the 200m in atrocious weather conditions in Ostrava and in New York, while his 100m race in Rio was only an early season tune up. Those close to him believe he is in condition to go much, much quicker.</p> \n<p>Given that the world championships start at the end of August, the Anniversary Games will be a crucial test of his form and his readiness to face the controversial American sprinter Justin Gatlin, who has not been beaten since 2013.</p> \n<p>Bolt’s decision was greeted with delight by Boris Johnson, who hailed it as the beginning of a new chapter for the Olympic Stadium.</p> \n<p>“The opening night of the Anniversary Games has attracted the strongest field ever assembled for a single night of athletics, providing Londoners with another ‘I was there’ moment,” the mayor of London said. “The chance to see a living legend like Bolt is very rare and we are delighted to be able to welcome him to the reopening of the stadium where he so thrilled us all at the 2012 Games.</p> \n<p>“It is a beginning of a new chapter for the stadium and there will be many more amazing nights to come – it is wonderful that we are starting in such style.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436518651216/Usain-Bolt-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Usain Bolt celebrates winning the men's 100m final at the London 2012 Olympics.

Warrington have got a great squad and some highly skilled players. I thought the quickness of both their dummy halves did some damage to us. Overall I feel encouraged by much of what went on but it was not enough to trouble Warrington on the scoreboard.”</p> \n<p>It was very much a case of job done again for Warrington though. After a mid-season wobble the Wolves are now just two points off fourth spot, and with form and momentum behind them, they look to be slowly getting on the right track ahead of the split themselves.</p> \n<p>The Warrington coach said: “We’re pleased overall. I thought we played alright all things considered. Wakefield have come a long way since we last played them. I thought they were good today; they were breathing right down our necks and it was a potential banana-skin today.”</p> \n<p>“We got troubled a few times near our own line and I have to pay tribute to young Miller, who was absolutely brilliant today. He was a real threat with ball in hand.</p> \n<p>“I thought Matty Russell was outstanding for us, his carrying of the ball was absolutely brilliant, and there were some terrific efforts from our dummy halves, Brad Dwyer and Daryl Clark. When they’re both out there, they’re a real threat.”</p> \n<p>A slow start from the hosts enabled Warrington to surge into a 12-0 lead, courtesy of tries from Stefan Ratchford and Joe Philbin, before Miller got his first on 18 minutes. By the time he scored his second Warrington had two more tries of their own to lead 22-6, but his hat-trick try four minutes after the restart reduced the gap to just eight points, sparking hopes of an upset.</p> \n<p>But the England international Clark then scored a wonderful solo try to calm any Warrington nerves, before the Catalans-bound half-back Richie Myler followed suit with another two minutes later. By the time Miller had scored his fourth the game was up for Wakefield, with Russell adding extra gloss to the result for Warrington four minutes from time.</p> \n<p><strong>Wakefield</strong> Locke; Tansey, Arundel, Lyne, Riley; Hall, Miller; Scruton, McShane, Kavanagh, Ashurst, Washbrook, Annakin. <strong>Interchange </strong>Anderson, Ryan, Sio, Walker. <strong>Tries </strong>Miller 4 <strong>Goals </strong>Miller, Hall</p> \n<p><strong>Warrington </strong>Russell; Ormsby, Wheeler, Atkins, Penny; O’Brien, Myler; Hill, Clark, Harrison, Westwood, Philbin, Ratchford. <strong>Interchange </strong>Dwyer, Asotasi, King, Wilde. <strong>Tries </strong>Ratchford, Philbin, Russell 2, Westwood, Clark, Myler <strong>Goals </strong>O’Brien 6</p> \n<p><strong>Referee </strong>P Bentham <strong>Attendance </strong>3,354</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/12/1436731530483/Wakefield-Trinity-Wildcat-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jacob Miller scores Wakefield’s fourth try but it was not enough to overcome a powerful Warrington side who ran out 40-20 winners.

Nearly four years on from his humiliation at the hands of the All Blacks in the 2011 World Cup semi-final, Cooper appears to be the frontrunner to fill Australia’s five-eighth role – at least for the opening Rugby Championship clash with South Africa, if not beyond.</p> \n<p>Coach Michael Cheika is a Cooper admirer and there is merit in seeing what the mercurial 27-year-old can offer the Wallabies against the Springboks and then Argentina in Mendoza the week after, rather than sticking with incumbent Bernard Foley. There will be no time for experimentation in the two Bledisloe Cup Tests and also no better venue to unleash Cooper than at Suncorp Stadium, his beloved home deck where he has produced arguably his best rugby for club and country.</p> \n<p>Cheika is yet to settle on his starting side for Saturday, but early indications suggest he seems to be leaning towards a halves combination of Cooper and Will Genia, with either Matt Giteau or Matt Toomua at inside centre.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been really, really pleased with what he’s done so far,” Cheika said of Cooper. “A lot of good energy, a lot of good communication from him in organising troops around him. We’ve got a lot of different combinations we can play – today he was playing with Matty Toomua next to him, he could be playing with Giteau next to him like he did on Friday. It’s probably maybe just having a look and seeing who’s playing best together.”</p> \n<p>A Cooper-Genia-Giteau playmaking nucleus would hark back to the famous Hong Kong Test of 2010, when the Wallabies edged the All Blacks in thrilling style to end a 10-game losing streak to New Zealand. </p> \n<p>Cooper has fond memories of that game and of playing alongside Giteau. “It was a tough battle and one of probably the best Test matches I’ve been a part of,” Cooper said. “It’s been good having Gitty back in Australia. I really relished the opportunity to play with some of the guys I got to play with in that game and just having him back here is great, not only for myself but the younger guys who wouldn’t have had the opportunity to play with him.”</p> \n<p>Cooper, whose post-World Cup future is still very much up in the air, has had a wretched run with injury this year but said he felt in good physical shape. He was restricted to just five Super Rugby games for the Queensland Reds due to two separate shoulder fractures, then injured his shoulder again towards the back end of the season.</p> \n<p>“I’m not going to lie, injuries are very tough mentally to overcome,” he said. “It’s something that’s a work in progress but I’m feeling good.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/b3cc13773bb5891087d16f2e86dc621f260ac575/0_44_3032_1820/3032.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1820,"width":3032,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dan Peled/AAP","altText":"Quade Cooper has impressed coach Michael Cheika in training ahead of Saturday’s opening Rugby Championship match at Suncorp Stadium.
