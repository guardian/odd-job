Shattered forward Molo was supported by team-mates when he appeared at Broncos training on Thursday just days after the tragic incident involving Queensland Cup player James Ackerman.</p> \n<p>Sunshine Coast forward Ackerman died in a Brisbane hospital on Monday after suffering a critical head injury during a match against Broncos feeder club Norths Devils on Saturday night. Molo’s tackle on Ackerman was referred straight to the Queensland Rugby League judiciary for a hearing at a “date to be confirmed”.</p> \n<p>Bennett said 20-year-old Molo “needs to be with his team-mates” as he tries to cope with the tragedy – a situation the veteran coach is sadly all too familiar with. Last year Bennett was coaching Newcastle when Knights forward Alex McKinnon suffered his serious spinal injury in a tackle.</p> \n<p>On the eve of Brisbane’s clash with Newcastle at Suncorp Stadium on Friday night, Molo and his Broncos team-mates were in need of the master mentor’s renowned man management skills.</p> \n<p>“It seems to go with the territory these days, coaching is in the background a little bit,” Bennett said of dealing with tragedy. “It’s making sure everyone in the club is handling the situation, particularly Frank.”</p> \n<p>Molo has received counselling since the incident and the NRL has reportedly sent welfare officers to Brisbane. Bennett said the best thing for the off-contract Broncos forward was to get back to his normal routine at the club.</p> \n<p>“He needs to be around his teammates. He was here this morning,” he said. “It’s pretty optional at the moment what he wants to do and what he doesn’t. No one has put any demands on him or telling him what he should or shouldn’t do. We are just supportive of him.”</p> \n<p>The QRL have been criticised for their handling of Molo’s charge but Bennett would not weigh in on the issue, only confirming that they had organised legal representation. Molo’s judiciary date is expected to be set after Ackerman’s funeral, which will be open to the public, at Sunshine Coast Stadium on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Brisbane players are expected to wear black arm bands in memory of Ackerman in Friday night’s game and offers of support continue to pour in for Ackerman’s family. About $14,000 has already been raised through a trust fund established for Ackerman’s wife and two children.</p> \n<p>A major fundraiser in Ackerman’s honour involving the Broncos and the Melbourne Storm – a Sunshine Coast affiliate club – is also in the works. Fans are also paying tribute on social media by posting pictures of footballs outside their front doors with the hashtag #putoutyourfooty, similar to the tribute to former Test batsman Phillip Hughes.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/c94d2a62a0bde0f1652d8db354b2c387170e941e/0_82_2226_1339/2226.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1339,"width":2226,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dan Peled/AAP","altText":"Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett talks to his players during training in Brisbane, Thursday, June 25, 2015.

Hughes and Dronsfield have transferred allegiance from Anguilla and Sweden respectively, while the other three have opted to compete for Great Britain having yet to represent the United States, where they are based.</p> \n<p>UKA has insisted it does not actively recruit athletes from abroad and is instead guided by international regulations on athlete eligibility. However, a leading coach, who asked not to be named, questioned the governing body’s motives before the World Championships and Olympics.</p> \n<p>He said: “The Olympics are coming up now and there’s all this panic because we need to get this amount of medals for the sponsors to stay with the GB team. They have gone after female 400m runners. If you look at it at the moment, we’ve only really got one and she’s not running that well at the moment. So you know there’s a blank space there that they want to fill in.</p> \n<p>“You look at the other athletes. A sprint hurdler, that’s another space they want to fill in. Then the high jumpers – we don’t have top female high jumpers, our best high jumpers are heptathletes. It’s very clever what they’re doing. They want to fill in blank spaces. It happens in Olympic cycles.”</p> \n<p>Hughes, 19, trains in Jamaica alongside Bolt and earlier this month finished behind him in second over 200m <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/13/usain-bolt-200m-new-york-icahn-adidas-grand-prix\" title=\"\">at the Diamond League in New York</a>, clocking 20.32sec. Hughes is from Anguilla, the British overseas territory which is not recognised by the International Olympic Committee and therefore ineligible at the Rio Games.</p> \n<p>Ofili, 20, is the younger sister of Tiffany Porter, the European 100m champion. Both are from Michigan, USA, but their mother was born in Britain and Porter opted to represent the country before London 2012.</p> \n<p>A UKA spokeswoman said: “No proactive recruitment takes place. If an athlete has British nationality and achieves the required selection standards, then they are eligible to compete for Great Britain and Northern Ireland.”</p> \n<p>The former sprinter Darren Campbell, who won Olympic 200m silver at Sydney 2000 and relay gold in the 4x100m at Athens 2004, said athletes unhappy because their places may become under threat <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/darren-campbell-gb-athletes-relish-competition\" title=\"\">should see the new competition as healthy</a>.</p> \n<p>He said: “I can understand why it would be unsettling but, if you’re trying to be the best in the world, then everyone needs to be beaten. It means the current British athletes have to be ready to go.</p> \n<p>“When you hear of a sprinter, aged 19, who is labelled the new Usain Bolt, that is going to spread fear among the sprinters. If his potential is realised, he’ll go on to run crazy times. This is going to block paths for other sprinters. You would be worried. But as I’ve said, your mindset has to change.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Martyn Rooney, the European 400m champion, wrote <a href=\"http://www.martynrooney.com/news/\" title=\"\">in his blog</a>: “Personally I’m a supporter of athletes coming across becoming British citizens on the condition that they contribute to British society. They should improve the standard of competition, help in local sports projects, pay tax in the UK, be good role models to younger athletes, integrate themselves into the team etc.</p> \n<p>“My wife, Kate Dennison, was born in South Africa and moved to the UK when she was four, she’s done all of the above and is a celebrated double Olympian. She took pole vault in the UK from national standard to world class and from her success, others have gone on to world medals. If the newest batch of athletes can do this, then we should support them the same as any other British athlete no matter what accent they have.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435167311758/Zharnel-Hughes-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Zharnel Hughes, right, finished close behind world record holder Usain Bolt at this month's Diamond League meeting in New York.

The decision resulted in the Italian team Luna Rossa withdrawing from the America’s Cup and Team New Zealand’s chief executive accused the remaining four crews of “self-serving manoeuvring”.</p> \n<p>Ainslie, who won the 2013 America’s Cup in remarkable circumstances against the New Zealanders with Team Oracle USA, is fronting a new British team for the 2017 competition and on Wednesday announced a new partnership with Land Rover. Ainslie’s team was renamed Land Rover BAR at their new multimillion pound base in Portsmouth that became operational this week.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/02/americas-cup-luna-rossa-pull-out\">Luna Rossa pull out of America’s Cup in protest over reduced boat size</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Of the row regarding boat size for 2017, Ainslie said: “It was regrettable that Luna Rossa decided to withdraw from the cup – Team New Zealand have been having a pretty tumultuous time of late and I think there is a lot more going on within that team other than just the issues around the class rule.</p> \n<p>“Now we have teams committed to moving forward in this exciting new class of boat, sharing a common goal. Team New Zealand, like ourselves, are heavily reliant on commercial funding. I’ll be hugely surprised that as a commercial team they could suddenly decide to not compete. I’m confident they will be there and be a strong challenger like they have been in the past.</p> \n<p>“We supported the shift to smaller boats for two reasons. Firstly, the longer-term vision from all the teams was to have continuity in the circuit, that we could collectively design a boat for the next America’s Cup and use the same one beyond. The other side was to reduce the costs; this new class of boat is containerised so the logistics of getting it around the world are more achievable.”</p> \n<p>Land Rover, the British automotive manufacturer, becomes a central part of Ainslie’s technical innovation group. It is the latest move by the four-times Olympic sailing champion to cement links with the motor industry, having already recruited Adrian Newey – Formula One’s most decorated designer – and Martin Whitmarsh, the former McLaren team principal who became BAR’s chief executive in March.</p> \n<p>Next month the America’s Cup World Series event takes place in Portsmouth, a qualification race for the 35th America’s Cup in Bermuda. More than 90,000 tickets have already been sold for the four days.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/24/1435148012272/Ben-Ainslie-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ben Ainslie's team supported the shift to smaller boats for the America's Cup.
