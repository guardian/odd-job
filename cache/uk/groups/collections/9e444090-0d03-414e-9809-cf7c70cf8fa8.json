However, the Guardian has seen the BBC’s initial email to Farah and his agent Ricky Simms, which is clearly dated 6 May, four weeks before the programme was broadcast. That email, which was sent to both men’s personal accounts, revealed that the BBC was working on a 60-minute documentary about drugs in athletics but did not intend to make any allegations that Farah himself had broken any rules.</p> \n<p>Crucially, however, it stated that they were investigating “a number of claims about alleged breaches of Wada [World Anti-Doping Agency] rules, including the use of prohibited drugs, involving your coach Alberto Salazar and your Nike Oregon Project [NOP] team-mate Galen Rupp”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/mo-farah-alberto-salazar-doping-allegations-false-statements\">Mo Farah’s coach says accusers are ‘knowingly making false statements’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Farah was then asked a number of short questions. It is understood that he replied a fortnight later.</p> \n<p>The Guardian understands that the BBC also sent a much lengthier list of questions and allegations to Rupp, with Simms – who is the American’s agent as well as Farah’s – cc-ed on the email. The BBC is understood to have received a reply a fortnight later.</p> \n<p>The Guardian asked Simms to confirm those emails were received and to clarify Farah’s comments from the press conference in light of those emails. He said that it would be best to wait, pending the publication of Salazar’s rebuttal to the BBC and Panorama, which is expected by the end of the week.</p> \n<p>In a statement to the Guardian on Monday, Salazar – who heads the prestigious Nike Oregon Project where Farah has trained since 2011 – promised to “document and present the facts as quickly as I can so that Galen and Mo can focus on doing what they love and have worked so hard to achieve”. It is also understood that Salazar, who was also contacted by the BBC on 6 May, is preparing a number of documents, emails and sworn testimony to back up his case.</p> \n<p>Farah is now back in Portland, having <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/mo-farah-pulls-out-of-diamond-league-race\" title=\"\">pulled out of the Birmingham Grand Prix </a>on Sunday after feeling emotionally and physically drained, and is not scheduled to race again until the Anniversary Games in London at the end of July.</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion that Farah has committed any offence, and at the press conference on Saturday he admitted he was angry that his name was being “dragged through the mud”. In a polished performance, Farah answered every question fully and comprehensively as he told reporters: “I haven’t done anything. That’s why I am so angry. It has affected my foundation, I don’t want kids to think I am doing something dodgy, when I am not.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/10/1433962514896/Mo-Farah-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo

of Origin I but hopes a consistent 10 metres in defence will avoid game two fireworks.</p> \n<p>Thurston has urged referees to crack down on the 10m rule in Origin II on June 17 at the MCG amid NSW claims they will retaliate if the Maroons use dirty tricks again.</p> \n<p>The Blues say they were victims of cheap shots in their 11-10 Origin I loss in Sydney, with hooker Robbie Farah claiming Queensland got away with it because officials were conned by the Maroons’ &quot;clean skins&quot;.</p> \n<p>Thurston admitted there was plenty of niggle in game one - from both sides - but felt there would be no Origin II dramas if referees Ben Cummins and Gerard Sutton provided a consistent 10m in defence.</p> \n<p>&quot;There always is (a bit of niggle),&quot; Thurston told AAP.</p> \n<p>&quot;When the referees get the interpretation of the 10m rule right, it’s normally a very good game.</p> \n<p>&quot;They’ve done an outstanding job over the last couple of years of controlling that and keeping it to 10-11m.</p> \n<p>&quot;That opens up the game a little bit as well.&quot;</p> \n<p>Thurston admitted keeping a consistent 10m may be easier said than done following claims by NSW prop James Tamou that the Blues would use Queensland’s game one &quot;cheap shots&quot; as motivation.</p> \n<p>&quot;It’s hard to get it right. It’s a pressure cooker for us and them,&quot; Thurston said.</p> \n<p>&quot;They’re not going to get every call right, but I think what the players and fans want is consistency.</p> \n<p>&quot;I’m pretty sure we will get that.&quot;</p> \n<p>Cummins and Sutton were retained after being in charge of Origin I, with NRL referees boss Tony Archer saying the pair remained the &quot;form referees so far this season&quot;.</p> \n<p>Maroons back-rower Aidan Guerra defended Queensland’s game one display but admitted they would not be changing their approach to game two.</p> \n<p>&quot;That’s the first I have heard of it,&quot; Guerra said when told of the NSW accusations.</p> \n<p>&quot;(But) Origin has always been a physical game.</p> \n<p>&quot;We have players in our side that really bring that physicality which makes it such a spectacle.</p> \n<p>&quot;We will be out giving our all.&quot;</p> \n<p>Guerra rated the series opener a &quot;typical, hard Origin game&quot;.</p> \n<p>&quot;There’s nowhere to hide in Origin,&quot; he said.</p> \n<p>&quot;The brand of State of Origin is different to NRL - it always has been and with a bit of luck it always will be.&quot;</p> \n<p>Queensland held a weights session on Wednesday at AFL club St Kilda’s training base.</p> \n<p>The Maroons’ preparation will click into another gear on Thursday when they hold their first field training session of their Melbourne camp.</p> \n<p>It will be the first chance Daly Cherry-Evans - filling in for injured halfback Cooper Cronk - will have to combine with pivot Thurston for the Maroons ahead of game two.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4874153df81a98333b79da8a560827e36a586102/0_116_5184_3112/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3112,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Steve Christo/Corbis","altText":"State of Origin I","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Steve Christo/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T06:09:26Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T06:09:28Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":44,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["State of Origin","Rugby league","NRL","Sport","Australia sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/state-of-origin","webTitle":"State of Origin"},{"id":"sport/rugbyleague","webTitle":"Rugby league"},{"id":"sport/nrl","webTitle":"NRL"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/10/jt-calls-for-better-origin-referee-consistency","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49k3g","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/10/jt-calls-for-better-origin-referee-consistency","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/10/jt-calls-for-better-origin-referee-consistency"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4874153df81a98333b79da8a560827e36a586102/0_116_5184_3112/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3112,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Blue’s Andrew Fifita is tackled by Maroon’s Jonathan Thurston and Corey Parker during the match at Sydney Olympic Park.

The upstart Australian, who became a millionaire in his 20s by trading property for credit, had a knack for starting new suburbs, and this was to be his crowning achievement.</p> \n<p>Yanchep Sun City, a luxury lifestyle city of 200,000 people, would be Perth’s sophisticated neighbour. And the greatest drawcard: it would host the 1977 America’s Cup, after Bond’s 12-metre yacht, Southern Cross, lived up to his frequent boast that it was the fastest boat in the world and won the challenge. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/australia-news/2015/jun/05/alan-bond-former-western-australian-business-tycoon-dies-age-77\">Alan Bond, America's Cup hero and jailed fraudster, dies age 77</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bond made no secret of his ulterior motive for entering the race, as if it were a perfectly ordinary thing to spend millions on an unwinnable international yacht race in order to shift a few blocks north of Perth. Investigative journalist Paul Barry, who spent years chronicling the West Australian tycoon, described in his biography, The Rise and Fall of Alan Bond, the response received by a churlish reporter who suggested Bond should enter the race just for the sake of the sport.</p> \n<p>“Anyone who considers racing for the America’s Cup isn’t a business proposition is a bloody fool,” Bond replied. “There can be no other justification for spending $6m on the Australian challenge unless the return is going to involve something more than just an ornate silver pitcher.”</p> \n<p>The scene was quintessentially Alan Bond: ambitious, audacious and risky; and blunt and perhaps a little over-candid. Such behaviour coloured his life for much of its 77 years, most in the public eye, until his death on 5 June 2015. <strong> </strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43a8fe678b2447d64f4bbcda79c495660d3afc76\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/43a8fe678b2447d64f4bbcda79c495660d3afc76/47_0_2098_3145/667.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Bond on Australia II on 14 January 1986 in Perth, Australia.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Bond on Australia II on 14 January 1986 in Perth, Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Feder/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yanchep certainly needed a boost. The subdivision had been farmland before Bond snapped it up (and, according to Barry, painted the sandhills green to make them look more attractive in the brochure) but sales had fallen away in the previous two years. Perth’s property market had deflated and with the value of Bond Corporation, which had increased its revenue 12-fold and it’s borrowings 20-fold in the three years between 1971 and 1974 only to close out the financial year $100m in debt. The ill-timed discovery that the Southern Cross was not, as it turns out, all that fast, could have ruined Bond. But ruin was still 20 years away.</p> \n<p>Bond was born in London on 22 April 1938. He immigrated to Australia with his parents, Frank and Kathleen, and elder sister, Geraldine, after a childhood split between Perivale and his father’s family home in the Welsh coal mining town of Cwmtillery, and arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia, on 8 February 1950. </p> \n<p>He left school at 14 and undertook a signwriting apprenticeship, which he abandoned three years later to start his own competitor signwriting business with his father. In 1959 he founded the company that became the Bond Corporation and in 1960 he made his first land deal, a five acre block in the Perth hills he bought for &pound;13,000. He borrowed the full amount and had already bought two more lots by the time the first subdivision was sold and paid off three months later. </p> \n<p>Bond was a skilled salesman with a knack for coming up with cash. He never worried about whether he’d get credit. His early business partner, Cam McNab, told Barry that Bond would often buy something they could refinance on the occasions that they couldn’t pay their wages bill. Bond did not bother to secure a loan before bidding on the building at 68 St Georges Terrace, which became Bond HQ, waiting until the gavel had struck to ask McNab to nip down to the bank and secure the 10% deposit they needed to put down before the hour was up.</p> \n<p>The high-risk strategy infuriated many who dealt with him, not least because it seemed to work. In a 2008 article discussing Bond’s return to the Business Review Weekly rich list world, Barry <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/jailed-fraudster-to-millionaire/story-e6frf7jo-1111116500223\">quoted Michael Smith</a>, a business associate at Lesotho Diamonds during Bond’s self-imposed exile in London during the 2000s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55ecd51df7b9e58bd4a843c313c82443828ba1ad\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/55ecd51df7b9e58bd4a843c313c82443828ba1ad/250_75_2185_3279/666.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Bond in 1994.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Bond in 1994.

You go into his office wanting to kill him and you come out thinking that maybe he’s right after all.”</p> \n<p>Bond married redheaded Eileen Hughes at St Patrick’s Church in Fremantle in 1955. Hughes was from one of Perth’s most prominent Catholic families – her brother is car dealer John Hughes – and Bond converted from protestantism to walk his pregnant bride up the aisle. The couple, who were just 17 when they wed, would go on to have four children: John, Craig, Suzanne and Jody.</p> \n<p>Suzanne, an international showjumper, died in 2000. Eldest son John is a respected figure on Perth’s St George’s Terrace and founding director of multi-billion property developer Primewest, but his reputation, according to Clarion Award winning business reporter Neale Prior, is the complete opposite of his father’s. “He has an impeccable reputation around town,” Prior told Perth’s 6PR radio station on Thursday.</p> \n<p>In contrast Bond senior, Prior said, had a reputation for doing “everything on the edge”.</p> \n<p>“He was punting 5 cents of his own money and 95 cents of someone else’s,” he said.</p> \n<p>“This man was huge. And the problem was, he just then proceeded to do bigger and bigger and stupider and stupider deals, and brought his life undone.” </p> \n<p>Bond made two more attempts at the America’s Cup before his historic 1983 win. Australia II, so secret that it was kept literally under wraps to evade prying American eyes, was the first boat from outside the New York Yacht Club to take the title in its 132-year history. The race was run just before dawn Western Australian time, and sunrise saw Australia’s prime minister of six months, Bob Hawke, toasting the win among the streamers at Bond’s Cottesloe home and declaring to the nation that, “any boss who sacks anyone for not turning up today is a bum”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c4139a1e6f767d56f4533fa96e5d1c1ebe7a8d5\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2c4139a1e6f767d56f4533fa96e5d1c1ebe7a8d5/438_835_3779_3559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Bond with Australia’s then prime minister Bob Hawke at a reception to congratulate the crew of Australia II in Canberra, in 1983.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"942\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Bond with Australia’s then prime minister Bob Hawke at a reception to congratulate the crew of Australia II in Canberra, in 1983.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Archives Of Australia</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The win made Bond a national hero and he was appointed as an officer of the Order of Australia the following year. He had already been named Australian of the Year, sharing the title with land rights activist Galarrwuy Yunupingu in 1978.</p> \n<p>By the time Perth finally got its America’s Cup in 1987 (at Fremantle, not Yanchep, the latter having been bought by Japan’s Tokyu Corporation in 1977) Bond had shocked New York society again by buying Vincent van Gogh’s Irises for US$53.9m at auction at Sotherby’s. It was purchased on borrowed money, at least half of which had been borrowed from Sotherbys’ themselves, much to the chagrin of the art world. After a brief tour around Australia the painting was returned to the auction house and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/arts/a-27-million-loan-by-sotheby-s-helped-alan-bond-to-buy-irises.html?pagewanted=2\">according to the New York Times</a> held at an undisclosed location until Bond could stump up the cash. In 1990 it was sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.</p> \n<p>Bond expanded his remit rapidly in the 1980s. In 1987 he founded Bond University in Queensland. That same year he made the infamous $1bn bid for Kerry Packer’s Nine Network, which Packer bought back for a mere $250m when Bond’s empire began to sink two years later. Packer used the proceeds to buy a 25% stake in pay TV company Foxtel and build the polo fields at his Hunter Valley property. After striking the deal, the late media mogul quipped: “You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime, and I’ve had mine.”</p> \n<p>By the late 1980s, tales of lost public funds in the WA Inc scandal under Labor premier Brian Burke were front page news. The Bond Corporation was one of several linked to deals with the government, which saw more than $600m in public money lost between 1983 and 1987. The scandal prompted a royal commission in 1990.</p> \n<p>Talking about his 80s heyday to <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s981486.htm\">Andrew Denton on ABC’s Enough Rope in 2003</a> Bond said: “In the 1980s, there was a sense in the business community that you could stretch the envelope.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Anyone who considers racing for the America’s Cup isn’t a business proposition is a bloody fool</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Alan Bond</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“If you were doing an acquisition or you wanted some planning permission, then the lawyers would work on the principle of ‘How do we get round the laws as they are today?’ And they would advise you,” he said. “They wouldn’t say, ‘Look, you can’t do it that way.’</p> \n<p>“So I think the laws were stretched, no question about that.”</p> \n<p>The world began to catch up with Bond in 1992. He was declared bankrupt, with a personal debt of $1.8bn. His wife, known around town as Big Red, left him after 37 years of marriage and a number of high profile infidelities on his part, including a 10-year affair with theatre producer Diana Bliss. Bond spent two months in jail for a fraud offence conviction connected to a 1988 bank bailout. </p> \n<p>He was released for re-trial and returned before the court on a new set of fraud charges in 1994, over the sale of a painting by Edouard Manet, but was declared unfit to stand trial because of complications resulting from his 1993 heart surgery which, Barry notes, <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/jailed-fraudster-to-millionaire/story-e6frf7jo-1111116500223\">had the curious effect of wiping his memory</a>. </p> \n<p>Soon after that his family was allowed to buy out his bankruptcy for $12m, paying about half a cent for every dollar owed to shareholders. Bond was no longer in debt but hundreds who had held shares in his company were.</p> \n<p>In 1995 he married Bliss, and in 1997 he was convicted of fraud and sentenced to four years jail for syphoning $1.2bn from Bell Resources to shore up the cash reserves of the failed Bond Corporation, a scheme <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/08/04/1091557905188.html?from=storylhs\">the crown prosecutor in the trial</a> described as “enormous in its magnitude, audacious in its execution and redolent of the most serious dishonesty.” </p> \n<p>The sentence was increased to seven years on appeal but abruptly cut short by the high court, which ruled that the Commonwealth Office of the Director of Public Appeal could not appeal a sentence that had been brought and passed by state.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime, and I’ve had mine</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Kerry Packer</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It wasn’t punishment enough for Tim Phillips, a former ASIC investigator who handled the investigation into Bond’s misconduct. Phillips told <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/stories/s108998.htm\">ABC’s 7.30 Report in 2000</a> that he was disappointed the sentence had been downgraded, remarking, “Mr Bond certainly has been fairly lucky, in my view, in terms of his connection to the law.”</p> \n<p>Barry also criticised the high court’s decision, calculating that Bond’s 1,298 days in prison equated to roughly one day in jail for every million he defrauded. In contrast, 22-year-old Aboriginal man Jamie Wurramara, in the Northern Territory, was given a mandatory penalty of a year’s jail for stealing $23 worth of cordial and biscuits.</p> \n<p>“Had the same formula applied to Bond,” <a href=\"https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/03/bond-m11.html\">journalist Mark Head notes</a>, “he would have been imprisoned for 50 million years.”</p> \n<p>Bond was released almost immediately following the high court decision and was banned by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission from being the director or manager of an Australian company for five years.</p> \n<p>He responded to the ban by moving to London, where he invested in diamond mining and oil in Africa and reappeared on the Business Review Weekly rich list in 2008. But then the global financial crisis wiped out the value of those companies. In recent years the 77-year-old appeared to be plotting a comeback to the Australian business scene, listing himself as the director of two companies - Strategic Asset Investments and Capital Asset Enterprises – which he registered with Asic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/australia-news/2015/jun/05/alan-bond\">Alan Bond obituary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bond split his time between Perth and London with wife Bliss, until she committed suicide in 2012, and remained close with his ex-wife, who also lived in London.

A decade ago England struggled to stay in the top 20, yet there is a paradox. In this same period England have often underperformed at the two top team events, the Olympiad and the European championship.</p> \n<p>England’s strength at world level is largely based on just six grandmasters who have ratings above 2650, the level of the world top 100 players: Michael Adams, David Howell, Luke McShane, Nigel Short, Gawain Jones and Matthew&nbsp;Sadler.</p> \n<p>The rankings rise is owing less to real improvement than to Sadler’s comeback and to John Nunn, who has a historic 2600 rating, returning to compete in over-50 senior tournaments. Below 2600 there is a big gap to GMs in the middle to low 2500s, while England’s juniors have not produced a potential 2600 player since Jones and Howell emerged in the late 1990s. The result is lack of strength in depth. The No100 ranked player in England is rated around 2240, while No100s in our West European rivals Germany, the Netherlands and Spain are all rated much higher.</p> \n<p>England’s ageing team struggles in the hurly-burly of Olympiads where more than a thousand players compete and where young GMs flourish. Even Russia has suffered, whereas China, whose squad has an average age in the low 20s, won both the 2014 Olympiad and the 2015 world team crown.</p> \n<p>The area where England is clearly No1 is in senior over-50 chess, where the former world top 10 GMs Nunn and Jon Speelman plus the 2014 European champion, Keith Arkell, have been joined by the legendary Short, who turned 50 this week and is already the firm favourite for the 2015 world senior at Acqui Terme, Italy, in November.</p> \n<p>So it is strange, to say the least, that the English Chess Federation directs almost its entire international budget to the underperforming Olympiad and European teams and gives little to senior chess, where it can expect gold and silver medals. Funding for England’s senior teams owes much to a single individual. Terry Chapman was a leading junior 40 years ago, gave up the game for a successful City career, and now bankrolls and plays in the senior side, where he has already won several team and individual medals.</p> \n<p>At the other end of the age scale, the&nbsp;juniors who will be the grandmasters of the 2020s, England’s situation is worse. In the 1970s England juniors were feared in Europe, and even in the 1990s our players won gold in world and European junior competition. Now the England squads are large, but their results are often disappointing, and even those scoring 50% are praised. It would be better to return to much more rigorous selection standards.</p> \n<p>However, there is hope. Some of our best talents now eschew junior events and follow a more testing route. They compete at Hastings, in the London Classic and the British Championship, and they travel to tough continental opens. England’s national league, the 4NCL, also plays a key role as team captains give norm seekers suitable opponents or even extra games with the white pieces.</p> \n<p>At the 4NCL season’s final rounds last month Guildford duly took first and second places, pressed only by Cheddleton in third. The focus was rather on two impressive individual performances. James Adair, 22, of York University, scored his second (of three required) GM result with a 9/11 total, while the 17-year-old Highgate School sixth-former Isaac Sanders achieved his first international master score.</p> \n<p>Adair was only a 2100 expert five years ago, while Sanders has developed his skills at strong events, including high-class opens in Eastern Europe. He won a fine attacking game against a former British champion and showed a mature style against other highly rated opponents. If his target now is the IM title by 18 and GM by 21, he is on course for it.</p> \n<p>Adair showed his defensive powers in this win against a Dutch GM, whose rare 6 Qd3 and 7 Bg5 has had good results. Adair countered with a surprise of his own, as his Be7 rather than Bg7 plans a fast counter on White’s long castled king. The critical test would be 10 f3 with g4, but van Kampen misplaced his bishops, then made a dubious double pawn sacrifice. Adair took the material, found an unlikely king hideout at d6 and e6, and won with an extra piece.</p> \n<p><strong>Robin van Kampen v James Adair</strong></p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> e4 c5 <strong>2</strong> Nf3 d6 <strong>3</strong> d4 cxd4 <strong>4</strong> Nxd4 Nf6 <strong>5</strong> Nc3 a6 <strong>6</strong>&nbsp;Qd3 g6 <strong>7</strong> Bg5 Nbd7 <strong>8</strong> 0-0-0 e5 <strong>9</strong> Nb3 Be7 <strong>10</strong> Be2 b5 <strong>11</strong> Kb1 Qc7 <strong>12</strong> h4 h6 <strong>13</strong> Bd2 Nb6 <strong>14</strong> a3 Nc4 <strong>15</strong>&nbsp;Bc1 Be6 <strong>16</strong> g4 Nxg4 <strong>17</strong> Nd5 Bxd5 <strong>18</strong> Bxg4 h5 <strong>19</strong>&nbsp;Bh3 Bb7 <strong>20</strong> f4 Bxh4 <strong>21</strong> f5 g5 <strong>22</strong> f6 g4 <strong>23 </strong>Bxg4 hxg4 <strong>24</strong> Bg5 Bxg5 <strong>25</strong> Rxh8+ Kd7 <strong>26</strong> Rh7 Ke6 <strong>27</strong> Rg1 Ne3 <strong>28</strong> Nd2 Rc8 <strong>29</strong> c3 Bf4 <strong>30</strong> Rxg4 Nxg4 <strong>31</strong> Qh3 d5 <strong>32</strong> Qg4+ Kd6 <strong><em>0-1</em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>3393</strong> (by F Abdurahmanovic): 1 Ne4! and if Kxe4 2 Qf3, or Kc4/e6 2 Qf7, or Kc6 2 Qd6.
