Farah issued a statement on Friday defending his reputation in the wake of a BBC investigation that alleged his coach, Alberto Salazar, had practised doping techniques with the American athlete Galen Rupp. It emerged this past week that Farah had missed two drugs tests in the buildup to the 2012 Olympics.</p> \n<p>Cram, the 1983 world 1500m champion, told the BBC: “It has begun to look like a bit of a witch-hunt against Mo. It seems as if some people are deliberately going after him and that is a shame.”</p> \n<p>Farah won gold in the 5,000m and 10,000m in London three years ago, with Cram commentating on his successes for the BBC. The <em>Panorama</em> documentary about Salazar did not accuse Farah of any wrongdoing but Thursday’s revelations regarding his missed tests led to further questions being asked and Cram sympathised with the 32-year-old. “We have gone off on a couple of different tangents from the original set of allegations,” Cram said. “The allegations were against his coach. Now Mo has also had to come out give an explanation about the two missed tests. We need clarification on that.</p> \n<p>“Some sections of the media seem keen to make out that a missed test means avoiding a test, which it does not. There is an individual here being targeted around his credibility as an athlete. In some quarters people are now saying he is a cheat. I can understand why Mo is annoyed and frustrated and all the other words he used in his statement.”</p> \n<p>Farah used Facebook to address his missed tests in 2010 and 2011, writing: “I have never taken performance-enhancing drugs in my life and I never will.</p> \n<p>“Over the course of my career I have taken hundreds of drugs tests and every single one has been negative. I’ve fully explained the only two tests in my career that I have ever missed, which the authorities understood, and there was never any suggestion that these were anything more than simple mistakes.</p> \n<p>“The last two weeks have been the toughest of my life – with rumours and speculation about me that are completely false – and the impact this has had on my family and friends has left me angry, frustrated and upset.”</p> \n<p>Salazar has denied the allegations against him, and Farah revealed he had travelled to his base in Portland, Oregon to speak to the American about the allegations. “As I made clear, I went to Portland to speak to Alberto Salazar and demand answers,” Farah added. “He reassured me that the claims are false and that he will soon be providing evidence to make that clear. Until then I will not be commenting further on the allegations.”</p> \n<p>Farah is training in France ready for a planned return at the Diamond League meeting in Monaco on 17 July. “Running is the one thing Mo can control at the moment and the one place where he can be Mo Farah and get away from this to some extent,” said Cram, a former world record holder over 1500m and the mile. “It can’t be easy but until something is proved against him we want to see him on track and racing because we don’t have many medal hopes. I bet he can’t wait to get back to racing.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434831642186/Mo-Farah-and-Galen-Rupp-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mo Farah celebrates winning the London 2012 10,000m final with the silver medallist, Galen Rupp. Steve Cram commentated on the race for the BBC.
