But it is understood that he has been preparing a detailed riposte to the allegations – including claims that he gave his athlete Galen Rupp, who finished second to Farah in the 10,000m at the London 2012 Olympics, the anabolic steroid testosterone when he was still at high school.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/08/alberto-salazar-coach-response-doping-allegations\">UK Athletics has questions to answer after Alberto Salazar allegations</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Salazar reiterated his view that the BBC and ProPublica allegations were inaccurate, unfounded, and had unfairly damaged him and his athletes. “I have said all along that I believe in a clean sport, hard work and I deny all allegations of doping,” he added. “The BBC and ProPublica have engaged in inaccurate and unfounded journalism, with a complete lack of regard for both Galen and Mo.”</p> \n<p>In a statement to the Guardian, Salazar – who heads the prestigious Nike Oregon Project where Farah trains – said: “Given the time and effort the BBC and ProPublica committed to making these false allegations I hope that media and fans will afford me a short time to show the accusers are knowingly making false statements. I will document and present the facts as quickly as I can so that Galen and Mo can focus on doing what they love and have worked so hard to achieve.”</p> \n<p>The BBC and ProPublica also claimed that Salazar, who is regarded as the best endurance coach in the business and has worked as a consultant for British Athletics since 2013, is said to have mentored Rupp to help him flout strict rules about using intravenous drips.</p> \n<p>Kara Goucher, the 10,000m world championship bronze medallist who trained at the Oregon Project until 2013, said that Salazar had coached Rupp to try to get a therapeutic use exemption for an intravenous drip before the 2011 world championships. Under Wada rules, such drips are prohibited and anyone caught manipulating the TUE process to get one would be liable for a ban.</p> \n<p>An unnamed athlete also claimed that Salazar told him to get supplemented with testosterone and thyroid when his blood levels were low. That athlete claimed: “I did a blood test at Nike and my thyroid was low and testosterone was low. Dr Loren Myhre [the Nike lab’s head physiologist before he died in 2012] suggested that I go and see an endocrinologist that Alberto and most of the athletes work with, to get testosterone and thyroid.</p> \n<p>“He said: ‘This is what Alberto does. You’ll feel better and you’ll be able to train better’, and so then I said: ‘Well, isn’t that cheating?’ And he goes: ‘Well no, Alberto does it.’”</p> \n<p>The documentary claimed that six other people who were associated with the Oregon Project have spoken privately to the United States Anti-Doping Agency with concerns about alleged illicit practices and unethical behaviour.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/08/mo-farah-ed-warner-uk-athletics-alberto-salazar\">Mo Farah’s blood record to be examined in wake of Alberto Salazar claims</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A former Nike Oregon Project coach, John Cook, while not accusing any athlete directly, has warned that athletics is losing the war on drugs. “I think it’s pretty obvious that drug testing can be circumvented in pretty much every corner,” he told Runners World.</p> \n<p>“The chemists are getting so good that some of the efficacy [of performance-enhancing drugs taken in small doses] can leave [the bloodstream] in less than 90 minutes. So how do you deal with that? Test in the warm-up area? That’s not going to happen.”</p> \n<p>Cook, who worked at the Oregon Project between 2003 and 2005, warned that athletics is in danger of becoming a charade. “I follow the sport without particularly much fervour or excitement because I know too much,” he added. “When I was naive, I liked it a lot more. I’ve been turned off pretty much.</p> \n<p>“The average fan remains ignorant in terms of it wanting it be Chariots of Fire. They think if [athletes] test negative, they’re as clean as white snow.

The confirmation that the Open Championship’s live television rights in the United States have been renewed – adding to the hundreds of millions of dollars this will mean for one of golf’s ruling bodies over a 12-year period – was a nod to NBC’s desperation to land a deal which ESPN was indifferent towards. However, TV executives are not devoid of all sense: the deal also illustrated the appeal of golf in the long term, when Woods will no longer be a factor.</p> \n<p>While there is no precise time frame for the end of the Woods era, his struggles on the course mean competitively Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth and their peers dominate the narrative. For all those who believe golf cannot prevail without Woods, or even someone approaching his status, there is regular evidence to the contrary. The sport, just like any, evolves, as it did when Jack Nicklaus edged into retirement.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/tiger-woods-us-open-poor-form\">Tiger Woods takes the positives before US Open despite his poor form</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There may not be anyone like Woods soon, there may never be, but golf need not vanish from the sporting radar because of that. Other features, such as the time it now takes to complete rounds and the cost of equipment, are more damaging to golf’s evolution than the regression of a marquee figure. The trouble is people seem scared to admit as much, both in fear of writing off Woods and examining the broader subjects golf must battle.</p> \n<p>Scrutiny of Woods’s game is increasingly uncomfortable. At the Memorial last weekend, a venue where he used to be able to prevail for fun, the 39-year-old followed up a Saturday 85 with a Sunday playing on his own, <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2488964-tiger-woods-at-memorial-tournament-2015-sunday-leaderboard-score-reaction\" title=\"\">the odd man out at the tail end of the field</a>. He was unable to progress from that position. Four rounds, 302 shots – 29 worse off than the play-off competitors, Justin Rose and David Lingmerth. For the first time in his career, Woods made six double bogeys or worse in a single event.</p> \n<p>Discussion of Woods before the US Open, which next week he will seek to win for a fourth time, at Chambers Bay in Washington state, is of the freakish kind. But he will seek to win it: despite every blow to his confidence, the mindset of chasing success apparently never wavers. Onlookers, meanwhile, are left asking whether he may make the cut and how badly he might score on a venue which, if the USGA is true to form, will not be even close to forgiving.</p> \n<p>If you are fond of betting on the ludicrous scenario, Woods is priced between 40 and 66-1 to end his major-winning wait on the outskirts of Seattle. The sad thing is, this is not exaggeration. And it is sad; the fall from grace of a once magical sportsman cannot be regarded as pretty viewing.</p> \n<p>Woods probably felt compelled to end an absence from competitive action, as was the case at this year’s Masters. He seemed to feel a form of duty, not only to himself, but to golf. It is also admirable that he is willing to perform under the scrutiny which surrounds his every move, amid a realisation that only tournament play will reveal his current level.</p> \n<p>The problem, though, is there is no clear sign of improvement. After eight months with another coach, Chris Como, and despite regular utterances to the contrary, you would struggle to pinpoint any area of technical progression. If disastrous stretches of holes were offset by routine brilliance, there would be cause for optimism. But they are not.</p> \n<p>Woods gives the impression of being technically muddled – a strange scenario for someone so naturally gifted. Extended breaks, whether through fitness ailments or a desire to have his golf “tournament ready”, have made no material difference at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-85890e46-b1bd-4d2d-a657-68ad5eca5fbe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433941356774/d0657884-b6c5-40d0-a12e-3a72dd078a10-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"tiger woods\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiger Woods during the final round of the Memorial, where he played the final round on his own and remained in 71st and last place.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas J.

Brandel Chamblee, a respected analyst for the Golf Channel, pointedly added that: “Time hasn’t done this to Tiger. He has done this to himself”. The latter point is a nod towards Woods’s desire to constantly remodel what was already a dominant golf game. In his defence, injury was a mitigating factor.</p> \n<p>As he lurches from embarrassment to embarrassment, the logical question to ask is how long Woods might give himself to get it right. His greatness is undeniable, but so too is the fact Woods cannot call on his once imperious touch any more. This process of making up the numbers in tournaments he used to win will torture Woods, one of the most ferociously competitive players who has ever lived.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/06/tiger-woods-worst-round-career-85-memorial\">Tiger Woods slumps to worst round of career with 85 at Memorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That is all as relevant to those confidently predicting some sort of imminent return to winning form as to Woods himself.

Bare facts show the likes of Inhoi Hur, Troy Merritt, Benjamin Herbert, Scott Pinckney and Wade Ormsby ahead of him. The list goes on and on.</p> \n<p>So for how long does he persist? This US Open promises to be a footnote. The Open Championship at St Andrews already bears resemblance to a line in the sand. In 2000 and 2005, he won, by eight and five shots respectively, at the Old Course. Even Woods himself will inevitably glance back to the peak of his powers when returning to Fife next month.</p> \n<p>At a venue he could at one time have successfully negotiated using hickory-shafted clubs and tennis balls, further failure would be a cruel blow. History, that great ally of this 14-times major champion, warns us against writing him off.

The upstart Australian, who became a millionaire in his 20s by trading property for credit, had a knack for starting new suburbs, and this was to be his crowning achievement.</p> \n<p>Yanchep Sun City, a luxury lifestyle city of 200,000 people, would be Perth’s sophisticated neighbour. And the greatest drawcard: it would host the 1977 America’s Cup, after Bond’s 12-metre yacht, Southern Cross, lived up to his frequent boast that it was the fastest boat in the world and won the challenge. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/australia-news/2015/jun/05/alan-bond-former-western-australian-business-tycoon-dies-age-77\">Alan Bond, America's Cup hero and jailed fraudster, dies age 77</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bond made no secret of his ulterior motive for entering the race, as if it were a perfectly ordinary thing to spend millions on an unwinnable international yacht race in order to shift a few blocks north of Perth. Investigative journalist Paul Barry, who spent years chronicling the West Australian tycoon, described in his biography, The Rise and Fall of Alan Bond, the response received by a churlish reporter who suggested Bond should enter the race just for the sake of the sport.</p> \n<p>“Anyone who considers racing for the America’s Cup isn’t a business proposition is a bloody fool,” Bond replied. “There can be no other justification for spending $6m on the Australian challenge unless the return is going to involve something more than just an ornate silver pitcher.”</p> \n<p>The scene was quintessentially Alan Bond: ambitious, audacious and risky; and blunt and perhaps a little over-candid. Such behaviour coloured his life for much of its 77 years, most in the public eye, until his death on 5 June 2015. <strong> </strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"43a8fe678b2447d64f4bbcda79c495660d3afc76\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/43a8fe678b2447d64f4bbcda79c495660d3afc76/47_0_2098_3145/667.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Bond on Australia II on 14 January 1986 in Perth, Australia.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Bond on Australia II on 14 January 1986 in Perth, Australia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Feder/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yanchep certainly needed a boost. The subdivision had been farmland before Bond snapped it up (and, according to Barry, painted the sandhills green to make them look more attractive in the brochure) but sales had fallen away in the previous two years. Perth’s property market had deflated and with the value of Bond Corporation, which had increased its revenue 12-fold and it’s borrowings 20-fold in the three years between 1971 and 1974 only to close out the financial year $100m in debt. The ill-timed discovery that the Southern Cross was not, as it turns out, all that fast, could have ruined Bond. But ruin was still 20 years away.</p> \n<p>Bond was born in London on 22 April 1938. He immigrated to Australia with his parents, Frank and Kathleen, and elder sister, Geraldine, after a childhood split between Perivale and his father’s family home in the Welsh coal mining town of Cwmtillery, and arrived in Fremantle, Western Australia, on 8 February 1950. </p> \n<p>He left school at 14 and undertook a signwriting apprenticeship, which he abandoned three years later to start his own competitor signwriting business with his father. In 1959 he founded the company that became the Bond Corporation and in 1960 he made his first land deal, a five acre block in the Perth hills he bought for &pound;13,000. He borrowed the full amount and had already bought two more lots by the time the first subdivision was sold and paid off three months later. </p> \n<p>Bond was a skilled salesman with a knack for coming up with cash. He never worried about whether he’d get credit. His early business partner, Cam McNab, told Barry that Bond would often buy something they could refinance on the occasions that they couldn’t pay their wages bill. Bond did not bother to secure a loan before bidding on the building at 68 St Georges Terrace, which became Bond HQ, waiting until the gavel had struck to ask McNab to nip down to the bank and secure the 10% deposit they needed to put down before the hour was up.</p> \n<p>The high-risk strategy infuriated many who dealt with him, not least because it seemed to work. In a 2008 article discussing Bond’s return to the Business Review Weekly rich list world, Barry <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/jailed-fraudster-to-millionaire/story-e6frf7jo-1111116500223\">quoted Michael Smith</a>, a business associate at Lesotho Diamonds during Bond’s self-imposed exile in London during the 2000s.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"55ecd51df7b9e58bd4a843c313c82443828ba1ad\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/55ecd51df7b9e58bd4a843c313c82443828ba1ad/250_75_2185_3279/666.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Bond in 1994.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Bond in 1994.

You go into his office wanting to kill him and you come out thinking that maybe he’s right after all.”</p> \n<p>Bond married redheaded Eileen Hughes at St Patrick’s Church in Fremantle in 1955. Hughes was from one of Perth’s most prominent Catholic families – her brother is car dealer John Hughes – and Bond converted from protestantism to walk his pregnant bride up the aisle. The couple, who were just 17 when they wed, would go on to have four children: John, Craig, Suzanne and Jody.</p> \n<p>Suzanne, an international showjumper, died in 2000. Eldest son John is a respected figure on Perth’s St George’s Terrace and founding director of multi-billion property developer Primewest, but his reputation, according to Clarion Award winning business reporter Neale Prior, is the complete opposite of his father’s. “He has an impeccable reputation around town,” Prior told Perth’s 6PR radio station on Thursday.</p> \n<p>In contrast Bond senior, Prior said, had a reputation for doing “everything on the edge”.</p> \n<p>“He was punting 5 cents of his own money and 95 cents of someone else’s,” he said.</p> \n<p>“This man was huge. And the problem was, he just then proceeded to do bigger and bigger and stupider and stupider deals, and brought his life undone.” </p> \n<p>Bond made two more attempts at the America’s Cup before his historic 1983 win. Australia II, so secret that it was kept literally under wraps to evade prying American eyes, was the first boat from outside the New York Yacht Club to take the title in its 132-year history. The race was run just before dawn Western Australian time, and sunrise saw Australia’s prime minister of six months, Bob Hawke, toasting the win among the streamers at Bond’s Cottesloe home and declaring to the nation that, “any boss who sacks anyone for not turning up today is a bum”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2c4139a1e6f767d56f4533fa96e5d1c1ebe7a8d5\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/2c4139a1e6f767d56f4533fa96e5d1c1ebe7a8d5/438_835_3779_3559/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Bond with Australia’s then prime minister Bob Hawke at a reception to congratulate the crew of Australia II in Canberra, in 1983.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"942\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Bond with Australia’s then prime minister Bob Hawke at a reception to congratulate the crew of Australia II in Canberra, in 1983.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: National Archives Of Australia</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The win made Bond a national hero and he was appointed as an officer of the Order of Australia the following year. He had already been named Australian of the Year, sharing the title with land rights activist Galarrwuy Yunupingu in 1978.</p> \n<p>By the time Perth finally got its America’s Cup in 1987 (at Fremantle, not Yanchep, the latter having been bought by Japan’s Tokyu Corporation in 1977) Bond had shocked New York society again by buying Vincent van Gogh’s Irises for US$53.9m at auction at Sotherby’s. It was purchased on borrowed money, at least half of which had been borrowed from Sotherbys’ themselves, much to the chagrin of the art world. After a brief tour around Australia the painting was returned to the auction house and <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/18/arts/a-27-million-loan-by-sotheby-s-helped-alan-bond-to-buy-irises.html?pagewanted=2\">according to the New York Times</a> held at an undisclosed location until Bond could stump up the cash. In 1990 it was sold to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles.</p> \n<p>Bond expanded his remit rapidly in the 1980s. In 1987 he founded Bond University in Queensland. That same year he made the infamous $1bn bid for Kerry Packer’s Nine Network, which Packer bought back for a mere $250m when Bond’s empire began to sink two years later. Packer used the proceeds to buy a 25% stake in pay TV company Foxtel and build the polo fields at his Hunter Valley property. After striking the deal, the late media mogul quipped: “You only get one Alan Bond in your lifetime, and I’ve had mine.”</p> \n<p>By the late 1980s, tales of lost public funds in the WA Inc scandal under Labor premier Brian Burke were front page news. The Bond Corporation was one of several linked to deals with the government, which saw more than $600m in public money lost between 1983 and 1987. The scandal prompted a royal commission in 1990.</p> \n<p>Talking about his 80s heyday to <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/tv/enoughrope/transcripts/s981486.htm\">Andrew Denton on ABC’s Enough Rope in 2003</a> Bond said: “In the 1980s, there was a sense in the business community that you could stretch the envelope.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Anyone who considers racing for the America’s Cup isn’t a business proposition is a bloody fool</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Alan Bond</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“If you were doing an acquisition or you wanted some planning permission, then the lawyers would work on the principle of ‘How do we get round the laws as they are today?’ And they would advise you,” he said. “They wouldn’t say, ‘Look, you can’t do it that way.’</p> \n<p>“So I think the laws were stretched, no question about that.”</p> \n<p>The world began to catch up with Bond in 1992. He was declared bankrupt, with a personal debt of $1.8bn. His wife, known around town as Big Red, left him after 37 years of marriage and a number of high profile infidelities on his part, including a 10-year affair with theatre producer Diana Bliss. Bond spent two months in jail for a fraud offence conviction connected to a 1988 bank bailout. </p> \n<p>He was released for re-trial and returned before the court on a new set of fraud charges in 1994, over the sale of a painting by Edouard Manet, but was declared unfit to stand trial because of complications resulting from his 1993 heart surgery which, Barry notes, <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/jailed-fraudster-to-millionaire/story-e6frf7jo-1111116500223\">had the curious effect of wiping his memory</a>. </p> \n<p>Soon after that his family was allowed to buy out his bankruptcy for $12m, paying about half a cent for every dollar owed to shareholders.

In contrast, 22-year-old Aboriginal man Jamie Wurramara, in the Northern Territory, was given a mandatory penalty of a year’s jail for stealing $23 worth of cordial and biscuits.</p> \n<p>“Had the same formula applied to Bond,” <a href=\"https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/03/bond-m11.html\">journalist Mark Head notes</a>, “he would have been imprisoned for 50 million years.”</p> \n<p>Bond was released almost immediately following the high court decision and was banned by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission from being the director or manager of an Australian company for five years.</p> \n<p>He responded to the ban by moving to London, where he invested in diamond mining and oil in Africa and reappeared on the Business Review Weekly rich list in 2008. But then the global financial crisis wiped out the value of those companies. In recent years the 77-year-old appeared to be plotting a comeback to the Australian business scene, listing himself as the director of two companies - Strategic Asset Investments and Capital Asset Enterprises – which he registered with Asic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/australia-news/2015/jun/05/alan-bond\">Alan Bond obituary</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bond split his time between Perth and London with wife Bliss, until she committed suicide in 2012, and remained close with his ex-wife, who also lived in London.

A decade ago England struggled to stay in the top 20, yet there is a paradox. In this same period England have often underperformed at the two top team events, the Olympiad and the European championship.</p> \n<p>England’s strength at world level is largely based on just six grandmasters who have ratings above 2650, the level of the world top 100 players: Michael Adams, David Howell, Luke McShane, Nigel Short, Gawain Jones and Matthew&nbsp;Sadler.</p> \n<p>The rankings rise is owing less to real improvement than to Sadler’s comeback and to John Nunn, who has a historic 2600 rating, returning to compete in over-50 senior tournaments. Below 2600 there is a big gap to GMs in the middle to low 2500s, while England’s juniors have not produced a potential 2600 player since Jones and Howell emerged in the late 1990s. The result is lack of strength in depth. The No100 ranked player in England is rated around 2240, while No100s in our West European rivals Germany, the Netherlands and Spain are all rated much higher.</p> \n<p>England’s ageing team struggles in the hurly-burly of Olympiads where more than a thousand players compete and where young GMs flourish. Even Russia has suffered, whereas China, whose squad has an average age in the low 20s, won both the 2014 Olympiad and the 2015 world team crown.</p> \n<p>The area where England is clearly No1 is in senior over-50 chess, where the former world top 10 GMs Nunn and Jon Speelman plus the 2014 European champion, Keith Arkell, have been joined by the legendary Short, who turned 50 this week and is already the firm favourite for the 2015 world senior at Acqui Terme, Italy, in November.</p> \n<p>So it is strange, to say the least, that the English Chess Federation directs almost its entire international budget to the underperforming Olympiad and European teams and gives little to senior chess, where it can expect gold and silver medals. Funding for England’s senior teams owes much to a single individual. Terry Chapman was a leading junior 40 years ago, gave up the game for a successful City career, and now bankrolls and plays in the senior side, where he has already won several team and individual medals.</p> \n<p>At the other end of the age scale, the&nbsp;juniors who will be the grandmasters of the 2020s, England’s situation is worse. In the 1970s England juniors were feared in Europe, and even in the 1990s our players won gold in world and European junior competition. Now the England squads are large, but their results are often disappointing, and even those scoring 50% are praised. It would be better to return to much more rigorous selection standards.</p> \n<p>However, there is hope. Some of our best talents now eschew junior events and follow a more testing route. They compete at Hastings, in the London Classic and the British Championship, and they travel to tough continental opens. England’s national league, the 4NCL, also plays a key role as team captains give norm seekers suitable opponents or even extra games with the white pieces.</p> \n<p>At the 4NCL season’s final rounds last month Guildford duly took first and second places, pressed only by Cheddleton in third. The focus was rather on two impressive individual performances. James Adair, 22, of York University, scored his second (of three required) GM result with a 9/11 total, while the 17-year-old Highgate School sixth-former Isaac Sanders achieved his first international master score.</p> \n<p>Adair was only a 2100 expert five years ago, while Sanders has developed his skills at strong events, including high-class opens in Eastern Europe. He won a fine attacking game against a former British champion and showed a mature style against other highly rated opponents. If his target now is the IM title by 18 and GM by 21, he is on course for it.</p> \n<p>Adair showed his defensive powers in this win against a Dutch GM, whose rare 6 Qd3 and 7 Bg5 has had good results. Adair countered with a surprise of his own, as his Be7 rather than Bg7 plans a fast counter on White’s long castled king. The critical test would be 10 f3 with g4, but van Kampen misplaced his bishops, then made a dubious double pawn sacrifice. Adair took the material, found an unlikely king hideout at d6 and e6, and won with an extra piece.</p> \n<p><strong>Robin van Kampen v James Adair</strong></p> \n<p><strong>1</strong> e4 c5 <strong>2</strong> Nf3 d6 <strong>3</strong> d4 cxd4 <strong>4</strong> Nxd4 Nf6 <strong>5</strong> Nc3 a6 <strong>6</strong>&nbsp;Qd3 g6 <strong>7</strong> Bg5 Nbd7 <strong>8</strong> 0-0-0 e5 <strong>9</strong> Nb3 Be7 <strong>10</strong> Be2 b5 <strong>11</strong> Kb1 Qc7 <strong>12</strong> h4 h6 <strong>13</strong> Bd2 Nb6 <strong>14</strong> a3 Nc4 <strong>15</strong>&nbsp;Bc1 Be6 <strong>16</strong> g4 Nxg4 <strong>17</strong> Nd5 Bxd5 <strong>18</strong> Bxg4 h5 <strong>19</strong>&nbsp;Bh3 Bb7 <strong>20</strong> f4 Bxh4 <strong>21</strong> f5 g5 <strong>22</strong> f6 g4 <strong>23 </strong>Bxg4 hxg4 <strong>24</strong> Bg5 Bxg5 <strong>25</strong> Rxh8+ Kd7 <strong>26</strong> Rh7 Ke6 <strong>27</strong> Rg1 Ne3 <strong>28</strong> Nd2 Rc8 <strong>29</strong> c3 Bf4 <strong>30</strong> Rxg4 Nxg4 <strong>31</strong> Qh3 d5 <strong>32</strong> Qg4+ Kd6 <strong><em>0-1</em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>3393</strong> (by F Abdurahmanovic): 1 Ne4! and if Kxe4 2 Qf3, or Kc4/e6 2 Qf7, or Kc6 2 Qd6.
