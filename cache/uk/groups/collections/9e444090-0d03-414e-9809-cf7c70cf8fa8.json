Technology, digital technology, has transformed lives and can give us a massive quality difference. We find phones and tablets very useful.</p> \n<p>“But we’ve got to make sure kids still have the opportunity to come outside in the fresh air and have fun, to keep obesity away. It’s [obesity] something that is at an all-time high and we are not being responsible – we need to educate children and parents as to the benefits of doing sport and PE, of eating healthy food and having an active lifestyle.”</p> \n<p>A separate YST report earlier in the year found that the average number of minutes schoolchildren were participating in PE had fallen below two hours a week. Meanwhile the new sports minister, Tracey Crouch, has promised to rethink a new, unified sport policy following <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/11/olympic-legacy-sport-participation-plummets\" title=\"\">disappointing participation figures released by Sport England</a> earlier this month.</p> \n<p>Gardener, who won Olympic gold in the 4x100m relay at Athens 2004, added: “More PE is a no-brainer, you’ve got to make it happen. Physical activity increases performance in the classroom.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435082207065/Jason-Gardener-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Olympic gold medallist Jason Gardener says: 'We’ve got to make sure kids still have the opportunity to come outside in the fresh air and have fun.'

An aggravating factor is the ongoing need for a deterrent for dangerous play such as this which carries with it the real risk of serious injury.”</p> \n<p> Speight’s ban means he will also miss Australia’s opening match of the Rugby Championship against South Africa in Brisbane on 18 July. </p> \n<p> Brumbies prop Scott Sio said the team would undoubtedly miss the hulking Fiji-born winger. “Especially with the calibre of player he is, he adds such a lot to the team, not just in attack but in his defensive awareness as well,” he said in Canberra before the verdict was announced.</p> \n<p> “We lose a lot there, but the best thing about our squad is that we’ve got guys like Robbie Coleman, James Dargaville, Nigel Ah Wong, Lausii Taliauli, who all add something different if they are called upon to replace Henry.”</p> \n<p> With their other winger Joe Tomane on fire after a hat-trick against the Stormers last week, it is in defence that the Brumbies will miss Speight most. If Speight had escaped a ban, he would have been responsible for marking All Blacks left winger Julian “The Bus” Savea on Saturday. </p> \n<p>Coleman would be the most obvious replacement on the right wing but while the 24-year-old has no shortage of pace, he gives up 20 kg in weight and 14 cm in height to Savea. </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/371943663d8d5832f94d4c750a539364f65ff8f5/0_155_3264_1957/3264.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1957,"width":3264,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gallo Images/Getty Images","altText":"Speight was on the receiving end of a red card against the Stormers at DHL Newlands Stadium last weekend.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T06:23:55Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T07:00:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Super Rugby","Rugby union","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/super-rugby","webTitle":"Super Rugby"},{"id":"sport/rugby-union","webTitle":"Rugby union"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/brumbies-henry-speight-out-of-super-rugby-semi-final","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a45p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/24/brumbies-henry-speight-out-of-super-rugby-semi-final","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/24/brumbies-henry-speight-out-of-super-rugby-semi-final"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/371943663d8d5832f94d4c750a539364f65ff8f5/0_155_3264_1957/3264.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1957,"width":3264,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Speight was on the receiving end of a red card against the Stormers at DHL Newlands Stadium last weekend.
