It was Hatton, the European Indoor 60m hurdles silver medallist, who had warned Ofili she was “not taking my spot” for Beijing. Only now she had. With only the top two at these UK trials being automatically selected – provided they have the qualifying standard – Hatton will have to rely on the selectors’ grace for the one remaining place.</p> \n<p>And so once again the debate over so-called plastic Brits – which began when Porter and others moved to the UK to benefit from lottery funding before London 2012 – was reignited. Porter and Ofili have an English-born mother, and so are fully entitled to represent the UK. Both are talented too, as they hinted at while finishing first and second in 12.83sec and 12.96 respectively, with Jessica Ennis-Hill third in 13.10. Yet it was hard not to feel sympathy for Hatton, a 20-year-old who has improved enormously this season, but is now crossing fingers and toes as she waits to discover whether she will make the world championships.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, as Hatton was being treated for a back spasm, Porter and Ofili expressed their delight at their one-two. Porter said: “It was really special. This was the first time we’ve ever raced each other over 100m hurdles. I’m just so proud of her and the way she executed.” Ofili, meanwhile, praised her new supporters, adding: “It’s nice being in front of the GB crowd and representing them.”</p> \n<p>But when Ofili was asked about Hatton’s comments last week, which included a suggestion that she had come to Britain because “America’s a bit too hard for her at the moment”, she clammed up, saying: “Every time I race I just focus on myself and executing the cleanest race possible and running well.”</p> \n<p>In the men’s 200m Zharnel Hughes – another recent transfer, this time from the British colony of Anguilla – insisted there was much more to come after winning the final in a modest 20.42sec, with Danny Talbot second in 20.61 and James Ellington third in 20.62.</p> \n<p>The likeable Hughes, who turns 20 next week, claimed he was only running at “85%” and reckons he is in shape to smash his personal best of 20.15 later this season. “That time is going lower man,” he said smiling. When he was asked whether dipping below 20 seconds for the 200m was on he replied: “Definitely, I’m in shape for it right now, because I’ve been running 20-flat in training so I know I can go sub 20.”</p> \n<p>In the women’s 100m heats, Dina Asher-Smith looked a class apart as she qualified fastest for Sunday’s semi-finals easing down in 11.31sec ahead of Asha Philip (11.47) and Desiree Henry (11.51). “It was decent,” she said. “My start was a bit iffy so I’ve got bits to improve on. But I was happy. It felt comfortable.” The men’s 100m heats also went as expected with James Dasaolu, CJ Ujah and Harry Aikines-Aryeety showing the ravine in class between elite and club level.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere on the second of three days at these British Athletics Championships, Isobel Pooley equalled Katarina Johnson-Thompson’s British high jump record with a leap of 1.97m, while Holly Bradshaw made a welcome return after injury in winning the women’s pole vault in 4.50m. Several World or European Championship medal winners also went through to Sunday’s 22 finals, including Christine Ohuruogu in the 400m, Eilidh Child in the 400m hurdles and Lynsey Sharp in the 800m.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/4/1436030680148/Cindy-Ofili-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Cindy Ofili, centre, finished second to her sister Tiffany Porter – a result that guarantees her a World Championships spot.

The Super League has traditionally been a struggle for the West Yorkshire club, suffering relegation twice in the last 11 years, but under Daryl Powell, Castleford have been transformed into one of the game’s familiar faces at the top.</p> \n<p>Their fourth-placed finish and appearance in the Challenge Cup final last year was expected to be a flash in the pan, but Castleford are again challenging under the stewardship of Powell, with four wins in a row moving them level alongside fourth-placed Huddersfield.</p> \n<p>The winger Justin Carney has played a major part in Castleford’s success under Powell, and the Australian believes that Castleford have evolved once again this year after their success last season.</p> \n<p>“It’s the same culture here, but it’s a very different side,” said Carney. “There’s different players and different ways about us; we lost [Daryl] Clarky and we play a lot differently this year. We’re finding our way a bit and teams are finding us hard to deal with. We can’t take our foot off the throttle, we’ve just got to keep improving and we should be good for the back end of the year.</p> \n<p>“We’re so good to watch this year too, it was amazing to sit in the stands and watch us play some brilliant stuff. It’s even better to play in too, though; we didn’t play at our best earlier in the season but we’ve settled in now and we look a mean team.”</p> \n<p>Carney will make the second appearance of his comeback from elbow surgery against Widnes on Sunday as Castleford aim to move into the top four, and he admits he was surprised when Powell threw him straight back into the side given their impressive form.</p> \n<p>“I’m delighted to just be in the side, because they went so well without me in it. I was fearing I’d have to sit on the sidelines for a bit because Denny [Solomona] and Ashley [Gibson] have done outstandingly well on the wings and I feared I’d be biding my time. I was a bit scratchy but I’m grateful to Daryl for putting me in and now the challenge is to get back to where I was before.”</p> \n<p>Should Castleford beat the out-of-sorts Vikings, who are without their captain, Kevin Brown, for at least six weeks due to a foot injury, then Huddersfield will have to defeat Hull Kingston Rovers to stay fourth. They have slid under the radar with just one defeat in their last 10, but the Giants’ assistant coach, Kieron Purtill, acknowledges the pressure Castleford are applying in the race for the top four.</p> \n<p>“Our main focus this weekend is to beat Hull KR to make sure we keep hold of fourth place with three games left, especially as Castleford are continuing to breathe down our necks,” he said. “We know the higher we finish, the more chance we’ve got of reaching our first Super League Grand Final, and that remains our main aim for this year.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/4/1436019009832/Castleford-Tigers-players-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Castleford Tigers players celebrate the Ben Roberts drop goal which earned victory against St Helens in June.

Wind the clock back a few years to the final two months of the doomed Matthew Knights’ tenure. As a mediocre Bombers outfit was winding down a middling season, the calls for Knights’ head grew louder. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Io4Mkk7SlIY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Io4Mkk7SlIY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  James Hird on Fox Sports’ On the Couch.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On Fox Sports’ ‘On the Couch’ sat James Hird. Any speculation of interest in the senior coaching gig he palmed off with non-answers. The white-anting was subtle and deliberate. </p> \n<p>This is not calling out Hird’s sin here - all industries with public prestige are set up in a way in which the ruthless thrive. This is about a flawed club legend who is staring down the barrel of the same fate as his predecessor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwcbMqMWtdQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwcbMqMWtdQ?start=562&amp;wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=562\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But while Knights was driven out by <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/knights-a-victim-of-big-three-20100821-139ye.html\">Essendon factions too readily</a>, these same factions have dug-in to protect Hird leaving the Bombers paralysed and floundering. </p> \n<p>In both cases it’s the club that’s suffered from the actions of self-interested parties putting themselves above the greater collective. And it’s damage more self-inflicted than anyone could imagine. Essendon people have done more damage to Essendon than anyone who hates them with the heat of a thousand suns ever could. </p> \n<p>All that said, Hird’s tenure has a different kind of threat facing it than Knights’ did. Knights’ tenure ended in a similar manner to which former Prime Minister Julia Gillard removed Kevin Rudd; the project had gone off the reservation and the only solution in the eyes of the parties of change was to blow it all and begin again. It may not have been the right move, but there was an action and a follow through. The bubble was allowed to burst.</p> \n<p>In contrast, Hird’s position echoes the Coalition government’s failed leadership spill at the start of the year. A unit had gone wayward with the leader to blame, but there was no official challenger and therefore no resolution, all the while a rabid minority remains steadfast in their support. </p> \n<p>Thompson stood up at the 2014 Critchton Medal and declared his ambitions in the same way Malcolm Turnbull handled leadership speculation, signalling intent without stating head on what the course of action was going to be. He didn’t want to count the numbers. Like Turnbull, Thompson’s movements have left the Hird issue unresolved, all while stirring the Essendon supporter base into a deep state of division.</p> \n<p>It’s a parlous position for a club that was once a picture of stability. Club legend Kevin Sheedy wasn’t just successful on field, he was master of uniting Essendon’s large and diverse supporter base off it. He was the grandfather figure who curbed the powers behind the scenes and kept the various coterie groups at bay. The contrast to Essendon under Hird could not be more stark.</p> \n<p>The absence of top-down control has been the source of most of their issues, even to an extent the environment that allowed the ASADA saga to manifest, was created by an absence of checks and balances.</p> \n<p>Sadly, there is no figure at the club in the right position to call off the factionalism or to help its countless wounds heal. And this is what Essendon supporters are frustrated at - the incompetence, indecision and incoherence. A plight that feels hopeless and inescapable, just see today’s listless performance against the Saints. At present there’s limited vision of where the team goes next. Are they rebuilding? Are they challenging? What exactly <em>are</em> they doing?</p> \n<p>Where the next red and black stalking horse comes from is anyone’s guess, but it’s likely the current cycle will repeat itself, if the club’s broken inner workings aren’t addressed. And if they aren’t, wilderness awaits. </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5fb007ee31bc57a9be4301bfddc6dd82d2a785a7/0_201_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Quinn Rooney/Getty Images","altText":"Essendon James Hird","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Quinn Rooney/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T07:59:35Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T08:10:40Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ben Cuzzupe","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ben-cuzzupe"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Essendon","AFL","Australian rules football","Australia sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/essendon","webTitle":"Essendon"},{"id":"sport/afl","webTitle":"AFL"},{"id":"sport/australian-rules-football","webTitle":"Australian rules football"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ben Cuzzupe","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ben-cuzzupe"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/essendon-red-and-black-stalking-horses","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4acmc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/essendon-red-and-black-stalking-horses","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/05/essendon-red-and-black-stalking-horses"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5fb007ee31bc57a9be4301bfddc6dd82d2a785a7/0_201_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A forlorn James Hird after Sunday’s loss against St Kilda.

It left Mark Sampson’s squad as one of only three European sides remaining in the competition, alongside France and Germany, and, as such, should have secured qualification for next summer’s Olympics in Rio.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\">Women's World Cup 2015: England dream dies with heartbreaking own goal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>With memories of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/jul/31/london-2012-team-gb-brazil\" title=\"\">London 2012 and beating Brazil at Wembley</a> in front of more than 70,000 fans still fresh in the minds of some in the squad, including Karen Carney, and exciting young talents such as Fran Kirby since added to the mix, what a glorious bonus that could have been from a tournament that should prove a tipping point for the game.</p> \n<p>Prior to Japan’s match against Holland in Canada, the German tabloid Bild caught the mood with a picture of their players beneath the headline “Danke, England” – with four European teams remaining and the Football Association having <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/30/team-gb-football-teams-2016-rio-olympics\" title=\"\">already abandoned plans to enter a team in Rio</a>, they knew qualification was secure.</p> \n<p>Unlike the men’s game, the Olympics is seen as on a par with the World Cup in women’s football. Denying British women the opportunity to play in it at such a crucial time for the sport’s development is looking more and more myopic with each passing day.</p> \n<p>Is the women’s game in the UK so well developed, so strong at the grassroots, so popular with fans, so embedded in schools, that it can afford to pass up the chance of one of the greatest shop windows it will ever have? Of course not. On the contrary, it is at a crucial phase in its development.</p> \n<p>To pass on the opportunity to play in Brazil – the home of the beautiful game, in a country where women’s football is taken seriously, in front of passionate crowds, as part of a British Olympic team, with all that entails – starts to feel like an act of vandalism.</p> \n<p>The arguments around a men’s team – as played out in the runup to London 2012 – are different and more contentious. For many reasons, from fixture congestion to the conflicted feelings of some fans, there are as many arguments against as for. That is just not the case when it comes to the women’s game, where it is virtually impossible to find anyone who is against the idea on principle.</p> \n<p>The reason we have ended up here is because of, as so often, the shortsighted and internecine nature of football politics and power games as played out by grey men in grey suits. The English FA was keen to put a team forward forboth the women’s and men’s competitions. With various levels of vigour, the idea was rejected by the other home nations who continue to maintain that to play in a joint team at the Olympics could, over time, undermine the sovereignty of the individual bodies.</p> \n<p>If there was to be no men’s team on principle, they railed, there could be no women’s side either. As it turned out, the men would not have qualified anyway because of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">the limp performance</a> of Gareth Southgate’s England Under-21 side in the Czech Republic.</p> \n<p>Obviously, it is hard to take much of what Fifa says seriously but, for what it’s worth, there have been repeated assurances from Zurich, both verbal and written, that playing a British side in the Olympics would not undermine the case for separate national teams elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Sometimes another rationale is put forward, that it would threaten the “special privileges” enjoyed by the home nations at Fifa – a guaranteed seat on the executive committee and a place on the Ifab board that codifies the laws of the game.</p> \n<p>Those privileges are being steadily whittled away in any case and should arguably be voluntarily surrendered if we are to take the moral high ground in the debate on Fifa reform.</p> \n<p>It is hard not to conclude that the most vociferous reaction, from the Football Association of Wales chairman, Trefor Lloyd-Hughes, was not somehow bound up in his personal disappointment at being passed over for the Fifa executive committee <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/24/david-gill-fifa-vice-president\" title=\"\">in favour of the English FA’s favoured candidate, David Gill</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/england-japan-postgame-coach-comments\">Laura Bassett is in a hard place right now … but she's a hero, says Lionesses coach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Under the previous Buggins’ turn formula it would have been time for a Welsh representative but under a new system in which Uefa votes on which candidate should take the seat Gill jumped the queue – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-fa-david-gill-resigned-fifa\" title=\"\">only to resign anyway when Blatter was re-elected</a>.</p> \n<p>Lloyd-Hughes, a retired ambulance driver from Anglesey, was furious at what he saw as English arrogance and was “livid” when he heard about the Team GB plans. Some of the resentment felt by the FAs in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland towards England is justified. There can be a tendency towards loftily deciding what is right for all four.</p> \n<p>However, to let such petty politicking and confusing internal rows get in the way of the development of a sport that should be at the forefront of faltering efforts to deliver a legacy from the London Olympics, and the thorny issue of engaging teenage girls in sport, is appalling. Surely the obvious compromise was to enter a women’s side and leave the more contentious issue of the men for another day?</p> \n<p>Not only will Sampson’s side be denied the opportunity to build on their momentum in Rio, for the handful of players from the other home nations who would have been in contention for a place in the squad the chance to play in an Olympics on the world stage is gone – probably for good.</p> \n<p>The Women’s Super League is now well established but has been a slow burn in terms of building attendances. Yet healthy audiences for England’s World Cup matches on the BBC, despite the time difference, have shown the appetite is there on the big occasion. To willingly turn down the opportunity to capitalise on that next summer and aim for Olympic gold is a decision that can only have the rest of the world shaking their heads and wondering, not for the first time, at the ways of our funny little island.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/2/1435836935897/Englands-progress-to-the--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's progress to the World Cup semi-finals underlined there is the appetite for the women's game on the big occasions.
