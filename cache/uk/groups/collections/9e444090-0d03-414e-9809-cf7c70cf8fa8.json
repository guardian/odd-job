She pointed the finger at the coalition for axing ringfenced funding for school sport in 2010 and continuing to fund policies that were not working.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t the wrong thing to promise,” said Jowell, now on the shortlist to be Labour’s candidate for the 2016 London mayoral election. “We were on track. It was absolutely, wholly and solely their fault. It was going to be delivered. We were on course to deliver it as the figures make absolutely clear.</p> \n<p>“Whenever I think about it, it makes me furious that this opportunity was squandered. My sense of fury is on behalf of all those kids who were starting secondary school five years ago.”</p> \n<p>Jowell said she believed Michael Gove, education secretary from 2010-14, acted for ideological reasons <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2012/aug/06/michael-gove-own-goal-school-sports\">in cutting &pound;162m in ringfenced funding for school sport</a> and that the decision had led to catastrophic knock-on effects. “It was a small decision with huge consequences,” she said. “I hope this is a huge stain on their consciences. When we get to Tokyo [in 2020] I think it likely we’ll be back to half of our medallists being from independent schools. It doesn’t mean they’re not great athletes but we challenged that by unlocking talent that might not otherwise have developed.”</p> \n<p>Sport England figures show there are now more than 1.2m more people taking part in no sport at all and that the decline has been especially marked among those from lower socioeconomic groups. “There are fewer people now playing sport,” Jowell said. “It is on the conscience of those ministers.”</p> \n<p>But she also highlighted the successful regeneration of the Olympic Park as an example that the Games had delivered on those terms. “Here is the legacy – East Village, the best place in London to live – 3,000 homes there and more coming. But the fact is that the coalition government allowed our very tight, deliberately targeted definition of legacy to become diffuse. I always knew that was a risk,” said Jowell, who was part of the delegation that narrowly defeated Paris in Singapore in the final round to win the right to host the Games.</p> \n<p>“We had two reasons for doing the Olympics. To regenerate this part of east London and to transform a generation of young people through sport. It was that pure and simple. The mechanism was school sports partnerships and targets for physical activity and sports participation. It was very clear. When they went everything melted away because there was no structure through which to explain it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/olympic-legacy-failure-school-sport-postcode-lottery-michael-gove\">Olympic legacy failure: access to school sport is now a postcode lottery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Her successor as culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/mar/28/jeremy-hunt-london-2012-legacy\">axed the Sport England participation targets</a>, although there was also concern over whether they were the right way to measure progress. Sport England funnels &pound;325m a year in lottery and exchequer funding into grassroots sport, while the government in 2013 agreed to ringfence &pound;150m a year for primary school sport.</p> \n<p>“It was a once in a lifetime opportunity that was squandered,” said Jowell, who also accused her successors of failing to take sport seriously in terms of health and education policy. “And the most wicked and negligent part of it was winding up school sport partnerships. We’re back where we started in 2002.</p> \n<p>“If a platform had been created and sports policy had been baked in to public health policy, you wouldn’t be worrying about obesity you’d be investing in sport. You wouldn’t be worried about heart disease, you’d be investing in sport.</p> \n<p>“You have to bake it into the Home Office, into health, into education and not see it as an optional extra in a way that sport on its own always will be.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436104650511/Tessa-Jowell-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tessa Jowell, pictured here at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, says 'a generation of children have been robbed of the chance to discover a sport they’re really good at'.

But could Johnathan Thurston be the greatest Origin player of all time? Yes, better even than the King, Wally Lewis, a man whose statue stands watch outside the former Lang Park in much the same way as Christ the Redeemer overlooks Rio de Janeiro?<br /></p> \n<p>Of course, in the entertaining (but admittedly pointless) quest to elevate one above the other, there are strong cases to be made for both of them; and Andrew Johns, Mal Meninga, Darren Lockyer, Brad Fittler and Cameron Smith too, while we’re at it. </p> \n<p>No-one, for instance, has made such a mark on Origin as Lewis. One of its founding fathers, Lewis had a profound influence on the Maroons, and with him at five-eighth, and captain, Queensland won seven of the first 10 Origin series. Perhaps just as tellingly, after his retirement the Maroons secured just five of the next 14. And it wasn’t just results he influenced. Lewis played a major role in creating the sporting and cultural juggernaut that is Origin today. And he did it not just with his skills and firing synapses but the sheer force of his presence. </p> \n<p>Thurston doesn’t have the bare-knuckled belligerence of Lewis the player: he seems too boyish for that, what with his kookaburra laugh and his playful sense of humour. Nor does Thurston, despite the damage he’s done to NSW, inspire hate from across the border as Lewis once did (pantomime hate though it may have been for most). No, even the most one-eyed of Blues supporters would struggle to dislike Thurston. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/07/nsw-state-of-origin-aaron-woods-profile\">NSW State of Origin star Aaron Woods: the mummy's boy with a warrior spirit | Patrick Skene</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But while Thurston doesn’t have the aura of Lewis he shares his unquenchable thirst to win, and with Thurston this is in evidence no matter the occasion or location, be it an Origin decider at Suncorp Stadium, a Test match at Old Trafford, or a friendly table tennis game within the confines of the North Queensland Cowboys’ clubhouse. Some athletes are afraid to win, afraid of the effort it will take and the cost it may bear. Thurston seems afraid to lose. </p> \n<p>Thurston also has arrows in his quiver that Lewis didn’t, like a prodigious step and near faultless goal-kicking. And unlike Lewis, who bustled on the field and relied more on strength than speed, the slighter- framed Thurston has an impish air, the cheek to try the unexpected. Doze off for a moment and Thurston will have managed the rugby league equivalent of tying an opponent’s shoelaces together and sticking a ‘kick me’ sign on his back </p> \n<p>More significantly, however, no-one has Thurston’s numbers. From the time the then 22-year-old former Souths Sunnybank junior debuted for the Maroons in the 2005 series, to the time of writing, Thurston has amassed figures as good as any Origin player in history: 19 wins (equal with Lewis and Lockyer), a 63% winning record (better than anyone), most points in Origin (174 and counting, ahead of Meninga’s 161) and most consecutive Origin matches (30, surpassing Gary Larson’s 24).Thurston was the only player to have played in all 24 games during the eight years of Queensland’s reign. </p> \n<p>Hard to believe, then, that early in Queensland’s streak there existed a school of thought that Thurston — already a star at NRL level — hadn’t quite imposed himself on Origin football in his first four games (2005 and Game I, 2006), and that perhaps Scott Prince might be a better option to partner Lockyer in the halves. But Thurston soon put paid to such nonsense and over the course of the streak he showed that when the biggest games came down to the wire he was at his best. The mark of a champion if there ever was one. As his Cowboys team-mate Paul Bowman once said of him, “He just has that ability to keep pushing himself beyond what most other guys do. You see him in the 80th minute keep turning up, keep turning up.” </p> \n<p>In the decisive Game III of the 2006 series it was Thurston whose chip kick set up Queensland’s opening try, and it was Thurston whose break late in the match from deep in his own half led directly to the Brent Tate four-pointer that got Queensland believing, <em>knowing</em>, they could pull the game out of the fire and put an end to their three-year losing streak. And after being man of the match in Game I, 2007, it was Thurston’s grubber kick in Game II of that year that found Steve Bell for the match-winning, series-sealing, try. </p> \n<p>In 2008 Thurston faced one of his biggest challenges, leading Queensland’s attack in the absence of an injured Lockyer. Prior to the series he spoke about not putting any added pressure on himself “by saying I’m going to step up and be the man with Locky away”. But that’s precisely what he did. It his ‘show and go’ with the scores level in the deciding game that saw Billy Slater score the winning try beside the uprights.</p> \n<p>One could go on like this at length, highlighting the moments, the games, when Thurston came into his own. But perhaps the most telling of these was following Locker’s retirement at the end of the 2011 series, when Thurston took Lockyer’s jumper and all the additional expectation and pressure that came with it. Queensland could have used the retirement of one of their greats as an excuse to lose, considering how much effort it takes to win. After six-straight series who would begrudge them a loss in the wake of their talismanic captain leaving the game? </p> \n<p>But Thurston, among others, would have none of it. In the deciding game of the 2012 series—before which he used a sports psychologist to help him deal with the pressure—it was another man-of-the-match performance from Thurston that helped get Queensland over the line 21-20. “There’s a fair bit of relief tonight,” he said after that win, sealed after a memorable field-goal by Cooper Cronk. “We were under a fair bit of pressure. We just had great self belief and we’re like a big family. I’m just so proud and pleased to be a part of it.” </p> \n<!-- Error: Failed to load image asset --> \n<p>Just as proud and pleased were the Maroons faithful who now had a new king to coronate.

Denying British women the opportunity to play in it at such a crucial time for the sport’s development is looking more and more myopic with each passing day.</p> \n<p>Is the women’s game in the UK so well developed, so strong at the grassroots, so popular with fans, so embedded in schools, that it can afford to pass up the chance of one of the greatest shop windows it will ever have? Of course not. On the contrary, it is at a crucial phase in its development.</p> \n<p>To pass on the opportunity to play in Brazil – the home of the beautiful game, in a country where women’s football is taken seriously, in front of passionate crowds, as part of a British Olympic team, with all that entails – starts to feel like an act of vandalism.</p> \n<p>The arguments around a men’s team – as played out in the runup to London 2012 – are different and more contentious. For many reasons, from fixture congestion to the conflicted feelings of some fans, there are as many arguments against as for. That is just not the case when it comes to the women’s game, where it is virtually impossible to find anyone who is against the idea on principle.</p> \n<p>The reason we have ended up here is because of, as so often, the shortsighted and internecine nature of football politics and power games as played out by grey men in grey suits. The English FA was keen to put a team forward forboth the women’s and men’s competitions. With various levels of vigour, the idea was rejected by the other home nations who continue to maintain that to play in a joint team at the Olympics could, over time, undermine the sovereignty of the individual bodies.</p> \n<p>If there was to be no men’s team on principle, they railed, there could be no women’s side either. As it turned out, the men would not have qualified anyway because of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">the limp performance</a> of Gareth Southgate’s England Under-21 side in the Czech Republic.</p> \n<p>Obviously, it is hard to take much of what Fifa says seriously but, for what it’s worth, there have been repeated assurances from Zurich, both verbal and written, that playing a British side in the Olympics would not undermine the case for separate national teams elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Sometimes another rationale is put forward, that it would threaten the “special privileges” enjoyed by the home nations at Fifa – a guaranteed seat on the executive committee and a place on the Ifab board that codifies the laws of the game.</p> \n<p>Those privileges are being steadily whittled away in any case and should arguably be voluntarily surrendered if we are to take the moral high ground in the debate on Fifa reform.</p> \n<p>It is hard not to conclude that the most vociferous reaction, from the Football Association of Wales chairman, Trefor Lloyd-Hughes, was not somehow bound up in his personal disappointment at being passed over for the Fifa executive committee <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/24/david-gill-fifa-vice-president\" title=\"\">in favour of the English FA’s favoured candidate, David Gill</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/england-japan-postgame-coach-comments\">Laura Bassett is in a hard place right now … but she's a hero, says Lionesses coach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Under the previous Buggins’ turn formula it would have been time for a Welsh representative but under a new system in which Uefa votes on which candidate should take the seat Gill jumped the queue – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-fa-david-gill-resigned-fifa\" title=\"\">only to resign anyway when Blatter was re-elected</a>.</p> \n<p>Lloyd-Hughes, a retired ambulance driver from Anglesey, was furious at what he saw as English arrogance and was “livid” when he heard about the Team GB plans. Some of the resentment felt by the FAs in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland towards England is justified. There can be a tendency towards loftily deciding what is right for all four.</p> \n<p>However, to let such petty politicking and confusing internal rows get in the way of the development of a sport that should be at the forefront of faltering efforts to deliver a legacy from the London Olympics, and the thorny issue of engaging teenage girls in sport, is appalling. Surely the obvious compromise was to enter a women’s side and leave the more contentious issue of the men for another day?</p> \n<p>Not only will Sampson’s side be denied the opportunity to build on their momentum in Rio, for the handful of players from the other home nations who would have been in contention for a place in the squad the chance to play in an Olympics on the world stage is gone – probably for good.</p> \n<p>The Women’s Super League is now well established but has been a slow burn in terms of building attendances. Yet healthy audiences for England’s World Cup matches on the BBC, despite the time difference, have shown the appetite is there on the big occasion.
