She pointed the finger at the coalition for axing ringfenced funding for school sport in 2010 and continuing to fund policies that were not working.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t the wrong thing to promise,” said Jowell, now on the shortlist to be Labour’s candidate for the 2016 London mayoral election. “We were on track. It was absolutely, wholly and solely their fault. It was going to be delivered. We were on course to deliver it as the figures make absolutely clear.</p> \n<p>“Whenever I think about it, it makes me furious that this opportunity was squandered. My sense of fury is on behalf of all those kids who were starting secondary school five years ago.”</p> \n<p>Jowell said she believed Michael Gove, education secretary from 2010-14, acted for ideological reasons <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2012/aug/06/michael-gove-own-goal-school-sports\">in cutting &pound;162m in ringfenced funding for school sport</a> and that the decision had led to catastrophic knock-on effects. “It was a small decision with huge consequences,” she said. “I hope this is a huge stain on their consciences. When we get to Tokyo [in 2020] I think it likely we’ll be back to half of our medallists being from independent schools. It doesn’t mean they’re not great athletes but we challenged that by unlocking talent that might not otherwise have developed.”</p> \n<p>Sport England figures show there are now more than 1.2m more people taking part in no sport at all and that the decline has been especially marked among those from lower socioeconomic groups. “There are fewer people now playing sport,” Jowell said. “It is on the conscience of those ministers.”</p> \n<p>But she also highlighted the successful regeneration of the Olympic Park as an example that the Games had delivered on those terms. “Here is the legacy – East Village, the best place in London to live – 3,000 homes there and more coming. But the fact is that the coalition government allowed our very tight, deliberately targeted definition of legacy to become diffuse. I always knew that was a risk,” said Jowell, who was part of the delegation that narrowly defeated Paris in Singapore in the final round to win the right to host the Games.</p> \n<p>“We had two reasons for doing the Olympics. To regenerate this part of east London and to transform a generation of young people through sport. It was that pure and simple. The mechanism was school sports partnerships and targets for physical activity and sports participation. It was very clear. When they went everything melted away because there was no structure through which to explain it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/05/olympic-legacy-failure-school-sport-postcode-lottery-michael-gove\">Olympic legacy failure: access to school sport is now a postcode lottery</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Her successor as culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/mar/28/jeremy-hunt-london-2012-legacy\">axed the Sport England participation targets</a>, although there was also concern over whether they were the right way to measure progress. Sport England funnels &pound;325m a year in lottery and exchequer funding into grassroots sport, while the government in 2013 agreed to ringfence &pound;150m a year for primary school sport.</p> \n<p>“It was a once in a lifetime opportunity that was squandered,” said Jowell, who also accused her successors of failing to take sport seriously in terms of health and education policy. “And the most wicked and negligent part of it was winding up school sport partnerships. We’re back where we started in 2002.</p> \n<p>“If a platform had been created and sports policy had been baked in to public health policy, you wouldn’t be worrying about obesity you’d be investing in sport. You wouldn’t be worried about heart disease, you’d be investing in sport.</p> \n<p>“You have to bake it into the Home Office, into health, into education and not see it as an optional extra in a way that sport on its own always will be.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/5/1436104650511/Tessa-Jowell-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tessa Jowell, pictured here at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, says 'a generation of children have been robbed of the chance to discover a sport they’re really good at'.

John Hopoate tackle</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"hopoate\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436244469308/hopoate.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Tonga-born player achieved notoriety by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ata8F7liAx0\">inserting his finger</a> into the anuses of three North Queensland Cowboys players during tackles.

Squirrel grip</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"squirrel\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436244472784/squirrel.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A frowned-upon but timeworn method of riling the opposition that involves <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjHs8QHwZ9M\">grabbing the testicles</a> of a player during the tackle, sometimes with a little bit of twisting. Understandably effective in causing them to lose focus.<br /></p> \n<h2>3. Grapple </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"grapple\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436244465210/grapple.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSu-uOiUz7E \">A tackle</a> once particularly associated with the <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/storms-grapple-whistleblower/story-e6frexs0-1111115983218\">Melbourne Storm team</a>, this move involves applying pressure to a player’s neck. It can in theory lead to a loss of consciousness and the Sydney Morning Herald has referred to it as “<a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/league/why-the-grapple-tackle-is-a-matter-of-life-and-death/2005/09/16/1126750128234.html\">a matter of life and death”.</a> It seems unlikely Lazarus would go quite this far.</p> \n<h2>4.

Think joints popping out of sockets.<br /></p> \n<h2>5. Crusher </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"crusher\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436244460856/crushergif.gif&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>A slightly more recent development in which the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8s92WF_ng\">head of the tackled player</a> is <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-18/nrl-to-further-target-dangerous-crusher-and-cannonball-tackles/5100470\">forced forward</a> onto the chest.

Denying British women the opportunity to play in it at such a crucial time for the sport’s development is looking more and more myopic with each passing day.</p> \n<p>Is the women’s game in the UK so well developed, so strong at the grassroots, so popular with fans, so embedded in schools, that it can afford to pass up the chance of one of the greatest shop windows it will ever have? Of course not. On the contrary, it is at a crucial phase in its development.</p> \n<p>To pass on the opportunity to play in Brazil – the home of the beautiful game, in a country where women’s football is taken seriously, in front of passionate crowds, as part of a British Olympic team, with all that entails – starts to feel like an act of vandalism.</p> \n<p>The arguments around a men’s team – as played out in the runup to London 2012 – are different and more contentious. For many reasons, from fixture congestion to the conflicted feelings of some fans, there are as many arguments against as for. That is just not the case when it comes to the women’s game, where it is virtually impossible to find anyone who is against the idea on principle.</p> \n<p>The reason we have ended up here is because of, as so often, the shortsighted and internecine nature of football politics and power games as played out by grey men in grey suits. The English FA was keen to put a team forward forboth the women’s and men’s competitions. With various levels of vigour, the idea was rejected by the other home nations who continue to maintain that to play in a joint team at the Olympics could, over time, undermine the sovereignty of the individual bodies.</p> \n<p>If there was to be no men’s team on principle, they railed, there could be no women’s side either. As it turned out, the men would not have qualified anyway because of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">the limp performance</a> of Gareth Southgate’s England Under-21 side in the Czech Republic.</p> \n<p>Obviously, it is hard to take much of what Fifa says seriously but, for what it’s worth, there have been repeated assurances from Zurich, both verbal and written, that playing a British side in the Olympics would not undermine the case for separate national teams elsewhere.</p> \n<p>Sometimes another rationale is put forward, that it would threaten the “special privileges” enjoyed by the home nations at Fifa – a guaranteed seat on the executive committee and a place on the Ifab board that codifies the laws of the game.</p> \n<p>Those privileges are being steadily whittled away in any case and should arguably be voluntarily surrendered if we are to take the moral high ground in the debate on Fifa reform.</p> \n<p>It is hard not to conclude that the most vociferous reaction, from the Football Association of Wales chairman, Trefor Lloyd-Hughes, was not somehow bound up in his personal disappointment at being passed over for the Fifa executive committee <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/24/david-gill-fifa-vice-president\" title=\"\">in favour of the English FA’s favoured candidate, David Gill</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/england-japan-postgame-coach-comments\">Laura Bassett is in a hard place right now … but she's a hero, says Lionesses coach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Under the previous Buggins’ turn formula it would have been time for a Welsh representative but under a new system in which Uefa votes on which candidate should take the seat Gill jumped the queue – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/30/sepp-blatter-fa-david-gill-resigned-fifa\" title=\"\">only to resign anyway when Blatter was re-elected</a>.</p> \n<p>Lloyd-Hughes, a retired ambulance driver from Anglesey, was furious at what he saw as English arrogance and was “livid” when he heard about the Team GB plans. Some of the resentment felt by the FAs in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland towards England is justified. There can be a tendency towards loftily deciding what is right for all four.</p> \n<p>However, to let such petty politicking and confusing internal rows get in the way of the development of a sport that should be at the forefront of faltering efforts to deliver a legacy from the London Olympics, and the thorny issue of engaging teenage girls in sport, is appalling. Surely the obvious compromise was to enter a women’s side and leave the more contentious issue of the men for another day?</p> \n<p>Not only will Sampson’s side be denied the opportunity to build on their momentum in Rio, for the handful of players from the other home nations who would have been in contention for a place in the squad the chance to play in an Olympics on the world stage is gone – probably for good.</p> \n<p>The Women’s Super League is now well established but has been a slow burn in terms of building attendances. Yet healthy audiences for England’s World Cup matches on the BBC, despite the time difference, have shown the appetite is there on the big occasion. To willingly turn down the opportunity to capitalise on that next summer and aim for Olympic gold is a decision that can only have the rest of the world shaking their heads and wondering, not for the first time, at the ways of our funny little island.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/2/1435836935897/Englands-progress-to-the--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's progress to the World Cup semi-finals underlined there is the appetite for the women's game on the big occasions.
