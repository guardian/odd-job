Virtually unconscious, he staggered on to finish sixth.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t until years later he discovered he had damaged his heart as a result, requiring open heart surgery and daily medication.<br /> </p> \n<p>Clarke eventually got his hands on an Olympic gold medal but from an unlikely source: friend and idol Emil Z&aacute;topek.<br /> </p> \n<p>Z&aacute;topek invited him to Czechoslovakia where, upon greeting him at Prague airport, he handed him a package containing his 1952 medal.<br /> </p> \n<p>“Look after this, you deserve it,” Zatopek reportedly told him. It was the kind of sportsmanship that Clarke seemed to attract.</p> \n<p>At the 1956 national championships at Olympic Park, Clarke tripped on the penultimate lap of the 1,500m final and was accidentally spiked in the arm and shoulder by rival John Landy.<br /> </p> \n<p>“I stopped to see how he was and he got up and said ‘keep going’, which I did and I won the race,” Landy recalled on ABC Radio.<br /> </p> \n<p>“He was an outstanding athlete, not only in the sense of when he made records, but he really did show to the world what was possible in endurance running.<br /> </p> \n<p>“He set a standard not only for Australian athletes but for world athletes.”<br /> </p> \n<p>Off the track, Clarke was a successful businessman, author and politician.<br /> </p> \n<p>He was elected the mayor of the Gold Coast in 2004, defeating the incumbent, Gary Baildon, and held onto the role until his resignation in 2012.<br /> </p> \n<p>In that time he helped the city secure the 2018 Commonwealth Games and in 2013 was appointed an Officer (AO) in the General Division in the Queen’s Birthday honours.</p>","section":"Australia","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/fceb8a1321492a0b4b62f3806aaef5e77fb16373/756_176_1533_919/1533.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":919,"width":1533,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave Hunt/AAP","altText":"Ron clarke","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave Hunt/AAP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/8049175a8899fdc8e0f3e1bf018957eb928f7630/0_399_2900_1741/2900.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1741,"width":2900,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ron Clarke, holder of the junior mile record, carries the Olympic torch into the stadium during the opening ceremony of the 1956 Olympic games in Melbourne.

In the meantime, here are some thoughts on tonight’s game from Les Carpenter:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> are tired now. The relentless zeal that pushed them to two early victories in the NBA finals has drained away. The series has grown long and the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love have proven all but fatal to the title dreams that burned just a week ago. LeBron James and a whole lot of enthusiasm are no match for the speed and depth of Golden State.</p> \n <p>Even with the series in Cleveland for Game 6 on Tuesday night, it feels like a last gasp for the Cavs. The way the Warriors raced past them in those final few minutes in Game 5 makes the result of this series seem a certainty. </p> \n <p>And yet because this is the finals and Cleveland have James, there remains that shred of doubt. If James is going to have that career-defining moment of pure greatness he never had to have in his title with the Miami Heat, tonight would be the time to do it. </p> \n <p>“One thing I’ve learned playing with LeBron for three years, you never count the man out,” his former team-mate Shane Battier said on a Monday conference call for the American Century Championship golf tournament. “If he scores 50 points, the Cavs will win. If he doesn’t I have the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> ending the series at six.”</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5580baa7e4b0e91d8f409675","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-17T00:11:04Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-17T00:38:05Z","body":"<p>Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

In the meantime, here are some thoughts on tonight’s game from Les Carpenter:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/cleveland-cavaliers\">Cleveland Cavaliers</a> are tired now. The relentless zeal that pushed them to two early victories in the NBA finals has drained away. The series has grown long and the injuries to Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love have proven all but fatal to the title dreams that burned just a week ago. LeBron James and a whole lot of enthusiasm are no match for the speed and depth of Golden State.</p> \n <p>Even with the series in Cleveland for Game 6 on Tuesday night, it feels like a last gasp for the Cavs. The way the Warriors raced past them in those final few minutes in Game 5 makes the result of this series seem a certainty. </p> \n <p>And yet because this is the finals and Cleveland have James, there remains that shred of doubt. If James is going to have that career-defining moment of pure greatness he never had to have in his title with the Miami Heat, tonight would be the time to do it. </p> \n <p>“One thing I’ve learned playing with LeBron for three years, you never count the man out,” his former team-mate Shane Battier said on a Monday conference call for the American Century Championship golf tournament. “If he scores 50 points, the Cavs will win. If he doesn’t I have the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/golden-state-warriors\">Golden State Warriors</a> ending the series at six.”</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5580c95de4b0e91d8f4096a8","title":"Tip-off!","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-17T01:12:46Z","body":"<p>Cavs score first at 11:31 of the 1st quarter on a made free throw by Iman Shumpert.

He says what happened getting into yesterday’s match was the worst experience he has had in years of following the team around the world.<br /></p> \n<p>“There were really young kids - six or seven year olds with their parents - being pushed around,” he says. “The way some of the fans were manhandled by over-enthusiastic home supporters, police, security, it was very tense and it just about got out of hand.”<br /></p> \n<p>He says there was no provision for Australian fans to enter the ground safely, there was a stand-off style situation with the police as they tried to enter and the group was split in two.<br /></p> \n<p>“We were trying to convince them we have tickets, but it took an awful lot. Then when they accepted there was a right for entry, there were local fans and some other really strange people trying to prevent us from getting around the barrier and into the area the police were trying to channel us into.”</p> \n<p>Security was heavy-handed getting into the venue, and organisation was chaotic. Some people had their bags searched seven times, with police continually stopping supporters as they made their way from the entrance to their seats.</p> \n<p>Around a dozen supporters - some who had travelled from Melbourne - were refused entry on the grounds that the match was a sell-out, Bateson says. They all held valid tickets. One woman was even refused re-entry after going outside to use the stadium’s portable toilets. </p> \n<p>The stadium’s official capacity is 18,000 but many people say the number in attendance was far greater. Home fans were seen jumping the fences to get in, and dozens of people scaled the ground’s light towers - and to quite dizzying heights - to watch the match.</p> \n<p>Bateson says several hundred home supporters were allowed to rush into the away section during the first half, despite concerns it was about to get out of hand. “You just don’t do that,” he says. “I’ve never had that before at an away game.” The pleas of expats - done in the local language - were ignored.</p> \n<p>Australian parents with children at the game left at half-time due to safety concerns. “You expect the unexpected ... but I think in the end it was all too much.”</p> \n<p>After the game, the Australian team manager told the travelling fans to stay in their section while the crowds dispersed, as there was “a lot of nasty stuff going on outside...it was bordering on riotous”. However, Bateson says local authorities insisted the Socceroo fans clear their bay and leave the stadium promptly.</p> \n<p>During the evening, a large group of demonstrators protesting against the country’s leader - who was in attendance - came close to getting through or over the stadiums’ fences, but dispersed once riot police arrived at the scene.
