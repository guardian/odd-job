It is based on the true story of forbidden love between two aristocratic siblings, Marguerite and Julien de Ravalet, executed in 1603 for adultery and incest, and the movie endows them with a grisly Abelard-and-Heloise-style pomposity and shrill self-importance, absolutely without eroticism or romance. They are played by Ana&iuml;s Demoustier and J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Elkhaim (who co-wrote the screenplay with Donzelli); Raoul Fernandez plays Lefebvre, the dull fellow to whom poor, pouting Marguerite’s family try marrying her off and — incredibly — Geraldine Chaplin plays his mum, with a peevish scowl and odd, almost Pierette-style makeup.</p> \n<p>There are turkeys and there are turkeys. This is a turkey de luxe, with stuffing, bread sauce, and a paper hat. It is the sort of thing that Ernie Wise might have written one of his plays about, with Glenda Jackson taking the female lead, opposite Eric Morecambe as Julien. There is mad over-acting, a sinister reactionary priest and two separate face-slapping incidents. When Marguerite and Julien finally make their escape, they have weird, freaky nature-embracing sex in a forest: it looks madly uncomfortable, like the performances. Afterwards, Julien somehow makes a fire, heats up water in a pan — and actually washes her hair. It’s a mercy that they didn’t settle down to watch the news on a TV set that he’d somehow rigged up. Anyway it’s a lovely moment. When they approach the coast, intending to get a boat across to England, they have somehow got hold of a donkey, on which Marguerite is riding, dressed as a boy — with a false moustache, apparently put on with a burnt cork. In later scenes, the moustache vanishes. Evidently, Marguerite decided it didn’t look convincing enough.</p> \n<p>It is strange that Cannes will keep on mystifyingly offering us terrible movies from its home turf or home team, often with this stately period flavour: wigs, and frills and furbelows: I remember Roland Joffe’s Vatel, starring G&eacute;rard Depardieu in 16th-century France — it was never released in the UK. Marguerite &amp; Julien is well up there in the awfulness stakes. It is strange to think of what Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut said about the stuffy old <em>cin&eacute;ma du papa </em>— this kind of cinema refuses to die, and why should it? And yet on the basis of Marguerite &amp; Julien it is already dead.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431982419261/322f8009-a818-4c0b-9ec5-1e7eeaa08179-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Marguerite and Julien film still.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T21:00:06Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T21:48:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":35,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Bradshaw","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterbradshaw"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Film","Cannes 2015","Cannes film festival","Period and historical","Culture","Festivals"],"tags":[{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"film/periodandhistorical","webTitle":"Period and historical"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Bradshaw","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterbradshaw"}}],"starRating":"1","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/18/marguerite-and-julien-review-tale-of-forbidden-love-cannes-2015","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/492ke","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/18/marguerite-and-julien-review-tale-of-forbidden-love-cannes-2015","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/18/marguerite-and-julien-review-tale-of-forbidden-love-cannes-2015"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431982419261/322f8009-a818-4c0b-9ec5-1e7eeaa08179-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mystifyingly terrible ...

Riley’s destiny is controlled by five emotions - Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Anger and Fear – who bicker over the best way to keep her safe and make her happy. Angry and confused at being moved away from her friends, Riley’s sense of Joy and Sadness are thrown out of whack and must travel through the realms of her imagination to restore order to her inner world. </p> \n<p>The film was inspired by director Pete Docter’s experience with his daughter Elie, who featured in Up. The 2009 Cannes opener – also directed by Docter - went onto win the best animated picture Oscar. </p> \n<p>“My daughter turned 11 and I saw her be much less energetic,” he said. “I wondered what was going on in her head.”</p> \n<p>Amy Poehler, the writer, comedian and Golden Globes host, plays Joy in the film. She described her character as “the motor” and drew a comparison between Joy and Leslie Knope, the enthusiastic, officious and useless middle manager she plays in the sitcom Parks and Recreation.</p> \n<p>”She keeps things moving. It’s really nice to have a job that is to tell everyone everything is going great. So yeah - I basically just do one character,” she joked.</p> \n<p>Mindy Kaling voices Disgust. She said she cried when Disney-Pixar gave her the script. </p> \n<p>“I’m not asked to do that many things,” said the star of The Mindy Project. “I’m very specific in how I look and talk. I’m resigned to writing my own things. [I’m glad I] didn’t scare them off. </p> \n<p>When asked about the challenge of acting out one emotion through a whole film Marilou Berry, who voices Sadness in the French-language version of the film, said the characters were actually quite nuanced.</p> \n<p>“It was a palette of emotions,” she said. “Like 50 shades of blue for sadness”. </p> \n<p>“I think she’s just given you your sequel title,” said Poehler. </p> \n<p>Early critical response suggests Inside Out is a return to form for Disney-Pixar. Their previous three titles - Cars 2, Brave and Monsters Inc sequel, Monsters University - received mixed reviews ending a string of critical hits that ran from 1995-2010. The Guardian’s Peter Bradshaw called Inside Out “a terrifically likeable, ebullient and seductive piece of entertainment” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/18/inside-out-review-cannes-film-festival-pixar\">in his review</a>.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431970278580/3a644449-6b20-41cc-bba2-a8141c74a856-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sebastian Nogier/EPA","altText":"None toon soon ...

Such shopping is a point of principle, home and abroad. </p> \n<p>“I’ve always wanted to be able to go into any corner shop in the world and say: ‘Packet of crisps, please.’ If you lose that, if you’re sending out for Polos, it’s not good. Some of your soul has gone and some of your creativity. That essential spark and hunger. You’ve got to feel joined up with people.”</p> \n<p>Izzard’s latest film is a cautionary tale about the dangers of celebrity isolationism. He provides the voice of Angus, a white cat in shades and black jumpsuit whose astonishing success as a musician has left him a virtual prisoner in his lavish mansions. It takes a visit from Bodi (Luke Wilson), a wide-eyed Tibetan mastiff with a gift for songwriting, to reintroduce him to life’s simple pleasures. </p> \n<p>For Rock Dog, Izzard says he wasn’t inspired by any particular old rocker, and the voice is a cocktail of Bowie and Jagger, with a splash of Suggs. “And I wasn’t channelling cat, per se. More a rock creative person who’s made such a ton of cash they’ve lost logic and feet on the ground. Their closest friend is a robot. I can’t relate to that. But, mostly, it’s me – me if I was paranoid and stealing other people’s ideas. There is a bit where I say: ‘I didn’t sign off on that photograph.’ That is actually me.

Next to him is Ash Brennan, Rock Dog’s director, who cut his teeth on Surf’s Up and Toy Story 2. They’re screening footage of the movie to potential buyers, with a view to releasing in the autumn. It’s quite a high-end product: the voicecast also includes JK Simmons, Matt Dillon and Mae Whitman. Izzard says he signed on when found Brannon was open to including improv. “The great Robin Williams started that with Aladdin, but it’s pretty much unknown in animation.” Brannon nods. “Animation’s so mechanical. It’s all technical. There’s no spontaneity, apart from when you’re recording the actors. But with Eddie’s part, we actually expanded it.”</p> \n<p>Being a comedian, says Izzard, there’s less risk of going full-Angus. “Part of our thing is, we’re the representative from the audience that gets up on stage and says: ‘Have you noticed how fish never play banjos?’ Whereas with rock stars – and film actors get this too – they feel they have to be in this rarefied place. If people actually knew they went to the toilet, it would all be wrong. But comedians say: ‘I went to the toilet today and that’s just how it is, kids.’ The Queen would never say she went to the toilet. She would refuse to admit that.”</p> \n<p>So she’s like Angus? </p> \n<p>“I think so. Ivory towers … I’m not a fan of the monarchy. Hereditary privilege is not a good idea, which is why America had a civil war about it. But then if monarchy does turn up and they happen to be good-looking, America does go insane about it. What about the revolutionary war? ‘Forget the revolutionary war! They’re pretty and we’re going to that party.’”</p> \n<p>Izzard is returning to the Riviera in the autumn, taking his standup show to Nice – the first-ever tour in French by an English standup. “On the 200th anniversary of the battle of Waterloo. I think that’s pretty groovy.”</p> \n<p>Would he ever take it further afield? Rock Dog is a Chinese co-production and both star and director are enthusiastic about the cultural crossover. Well, says Izzard, Mandarin is on his list, along with Spanish, Russian and Arabic. “No language is that hard to learn. All Mandarin Chinese kids speak Mandarin Chinese. You never go to a country and they say: ‘This language – too hard! These kids just gave up.’” Izzard drums his multicultural nails on the coffee table and grins. “That never happens.

Yet at this year’s festival, an incendiary new documentary is quietly hoping to prompt a revolution both on and off the red carpet.</p> \n<p>The True Cost is a Kickstarter-funded film which examines the fallout from the ever-expanding fashion industry, from the companies that exploit underpaid workers to the pesticides involved in cotton production that affect the environment and health of those around them. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-membership\"> \n <p> <span>Membership Event: </span><a href=\"https://membership.theguardian.com/event/the-true-cost-preview-screening-and-talk-16815683161\">The True Cost: preview screening and talk</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I think we’re at a point where people are ready,” said director Andrew Morgan of how he hopes the film will impact audiences. “I think we’ve left people ignorant for a long time.” Along with executive producer Livia Firth, the creative director of brand consultancy Eco-Age, he hopes the film will awaken consumers and businesses alike to the unsustainability of increased production. “I think the situation today is so messed up that we’re all in it in some way,” said Firth. “We’ve been brainwashed to think that we have to consume at such a fast pace. But as consumers, we need to realise how powerful we are. Every time we buy something, we actually vote, and if the brand still wants a business that is profitable in 15 to 20 years, they have to address the environmental impact and the social injustice. Because it’s only going to get worse.”</p> \n<p>Unlike climate change or extreme poverty, Morgan believes that ordinary people can help to change the damage of “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2014/apr/20/should-we-say-no-to-fast-fashion\">fast fashion</a>”. “It’s important to bring it down to people’s level, and that’s what clothing does,” he said. “What if we started by slowing down and not consuming so much stuff, just because it’s there and cheap and available. It’s amazing how that process makes sense financially, it makes sense ethically, it makes sense environmentally.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OaGp5_Sfbss\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OaGp5_Sfbss?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the trailer for The True Cost – video\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While the film makes some incendiary points about how big brands treat the environment and the people they employ, it’s careful not to place the blame at any specific company’s door. “There’s been a lot of legal involvement in the film,” said Morgan. “My goal was to make a film that was not just a shame and blame game about one company. If we make one company look like the villain, then we excuse ourselves from any responsibility.” </p> \n<p>Morgan and his team contacted brands to become involved, but were rebuffed. Now, he says, the conversation is starting to change. “We’re eager for them to see it,” he says. “They were not interested when we were making it, and they’re very interested in it now that it’s coming out.” He’s keen, he adds, to help create a constructive conversation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If we make one company look like the villain, then we excuse ourselves from any responsibility</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Firth, who also created the Green Carpet Challenge, which brought sustainable style to A-listers, believes it’s a conversation that should also be taking place in Hollywood. “More and more actresses choose the clothes they wear based on the story behind them,” she said. Firth has worked with Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Julianne Moore and Cate Blanchett.</p> \n<p>Morgan and Firth stress that enjoyment of fashion should not make people feel inherently guilty. If anything, they say, they want people to enjoy clothes more. “When you buy something that you really desire, you care for it in a different way,” said Firth, who was wearing a dress of her mother’s from 1964. “You make an investment, and this is what our wardrobe should be made of: investment pieces that last forever, not throwaway pieces that we don’t care about.”</p> \n<p>Morgan added: “People should love the clothing they wear. Enough of this so-so. Love what you’re wearing and hold on to it”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431961519380/e71c6d0c-e407-4d92-9b98-373280dd16ce-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David M.

This is another of his unique imagist cine-poems: an essay in psychogeography and a meditation on death, the presence of the spirit world in nature and the unquiet ghosts of guilt and pain in the Thai nation, as symbolised by the military - a recurrent trope in his work.<br /> <br /> Cemetery of Splendour has that unmistakable blend of an almost clinical reality and rationality with spirituality and mysticism. There is no incidental music; ambient noise is generally limited to cicadas and scenes and characters are shown largely in medium and long-shot, speaking evenly, and unemphatically framed and composed.<br /> <br /> The story in some ways echoes his 2006 movie Syndromes and a Century. A group of soldiers employed in digging up a building site for a government project has fallen ill with a mysterious kind of sleeping sickness.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2010/may/24/apichatpong-weerasethakul-palm-dor-cannes-interview\">Apichatpong Weerasethakul: eclectic dreams</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> They are being cared for at a temporary hospital building which seems oddly open to the elements. Keng (Jarinpattra Rueangram) is a young volunteer at the hospital who has the powers of a medium – she says the reason for the soldiers’ condition is that they have disturbed an ancient cemetery of kings. The spirits of the dead are siphoning the soldiers’ energy; hence their narcolepsy.<br /> <br /> Keng befriends Jenjira (Jenjira Pongpas Widner) another volunteer, caring for Itt (Banlip Lomnoi, from Weerasethakul’s 2004 film Tropical Malady) who like the rest of the soldiers becomes a living ghost, channelling the presence of the departed kings and their world.<br /> <br /> Keng and Jenjira become friends, and Jenjira confides to her a relationship with an American – but teasingly claims she would rather be with a European because they are richer – and finally opens up to Keng about an agonising and mortifying disability in her leg. But Jenjira is also, startlingly, visited by the spirits of two Laotian princesses who appear naturally and calmly: dressed as mortal women.<br /> <br /> Weerasethakul combines a gentle deadpan humour – some of the nursing attendants gigglingly touch a sleeping soldier’s erection – with his usual quietist worldview. If the sleeping sickness is a form of group hysteria, then it is a very calm sort of hysteria. But more than this, it is another example of this director’s insistence on a spiritual realm which overlaps with our own: a realm from which ghosts and spirits will appear, and be just as ordinary as anyone else. And in this context, Jen’s own loneliness and gentle spirituality are deeply affecting. It is such a strange film in its way, stranger still if you are not accustomed to Weerasethakul’s work, and it needs a real investment of attention. But there is something sublime in it.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431970925579/02e89335-6800-4423-b9a9-457f45418239-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Cemetery of Splendour","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T17:48:20Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T23:29:29Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Bradshaw","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterbradshaw"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Culture","Film","Cannes film festival","Apichatpong Weerasethakul","Drama","Festivals"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"film/apichatpong-weerasethakul","webTitle":"Apichatpong Weerasethakul"},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Bradshaw","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterbradshaw"}}],"starRating":"4","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/18/cemetery-of-splendour-review-apichatpong-weerasethakul","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/492t6","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/18/cemetery-of-splendour-review-apichatpong-weerasethakul","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/18/cemetery-of-splendour-review-apichatpong-weerasethakul"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431970925579/02e89335-6800-4423-b9a9-457f45418239-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Something like the spirit world ...
