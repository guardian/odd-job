It is conceived in (and almost dwarfed by) a vast Scottish plain, like Peter Jackson’s Middle Earth. The movie never entirely quits the battlefield (“heath” is replaced with “battlefield” in one early tinkering with the text) above which the air finally becomes blood red in a dusty fog of war — a Scots Outback, maybe. The leery figure of the Porter is entirely removed: this is a deadly serious Macbeth, with fascinating moments and shrewd, sharp insights, though often the pace is conducted at a uniform drumbeat. There are slo-mo battles, stylised blood-spouts and bellicose roaring, perhaps influenced by Kurosawa’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/1999/mar/04/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm\">Throne of Blood </a>— and some mangled Scottish accents from its Irish, French and English stars. The genuine Scots voices, coming from the mouths of minor characters, sound like a documentary-realist interjection from another film. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2a69ae34fa3ae18532edbaa8d9fa1ef4400fd680\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432270652288/a9c235b3-0a4e-4649-b509-3152e9eea26d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Macbeth.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As Macbeth and Lady Macbeth, Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard are a dream-team pairing, actors who radiate charisma, perhaps more charisma than can be entirely absorbed into the fabric of the film. As ever, Cotillard is able to convey enormous amounts with her face without saying a word. Fassbender is arguably less good with Macbeth’s introverted vulnerability and self-questioning, but always effortlessly virile and watchable, responding to Macbeth’s outbursts of anger and imperious paranoia. When he dismisses the witches: “Infected be the air whereon they ride/And damned all those that trust them!” he tops it off with a whooping rebel yell. Paddy Considine is a frowningly vigilant Banquo and David Thewlis is Duncan, the sacrificial victim King smilingly presiding over the nation which sometimes looks focused on a pagan court and sometimes in a vast Christian cathedral from a later age. </p> \n<p>Right off the bat, Kurzel begins with a bold flourish. Tackling the perennial question of the couple’s evident childlessness, and Lady Macbeth’s mysterious later allusions to breast feeding, he starts with the two attending the infant’s funeral. Kurzel’s version intuits the way that Lady Macbeth is embittered, anguished, and that her grief is what has become twisted into murderous ambition — and he also interestingly connects her emotional torment with the weird sisters themselves, the three witches: a radioactive feminine agony in the firmament, playing on a soldier’s macho aggression. And it’s something that makes more sense of Macbeth’s resentment of Banquo’s son.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cb6cf23da812cea3ca8fbe8ef451c8ca1f3737cb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432270733343/1afe5c44-e8c0-43b9-a7f7-6145be2c35e6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Macbeth.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kurzel’s other interpretative flourish is the way he handles Macbeth’s speech after Duncan is murdered: “Had I but died an hour before this chance,/I had lived a blessed time …” Some productions show that Macbeth is of course play-acting for the court’s benefit, but also genuinely realising — to his own secret horror and guilt — that he does in fact believe what he is saying. Kurzel and Fassbender play it quite differently. Fassbender’s Macbeth slumps next to Duncan’s blood-stained corpse and sneeringly speaks the line directly into the stunned face of Duncan’s rightful heir Malcolm, played by Jack Reynor, who has discovered the scene. It is if he is brazening the thing out, challenging the milksop youth to fight him or flee, or possibly already withdrawing into his own psychotic and delusional world. </p> \n<p>For her part, Cotillard is able to command her own space in the film, doing more with less. As she greets Duncan as the King arrives at their house (actually a kind of personalised encampment) she is a picture of demurely sinister intent and for their intense disputes, while Macbeth appears to want to back out, Cotillard gives a whiplash-crack to her denunciation of cowardice. Actually, her Frenchness is not a problem, she seems like a foreign Tudor bride who has time-travelled back to 11th-century Scotland. </p> \n<p>Later, the Macbeths’ “Queen is dead” scene is genuinely quite shocking and Fassbender brings his A-game to the resulting “Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow” speech. And when he has to address Seyton, he pronounces it “Satan” to give his situation an even more diabolic ring.</p> \n<p>There is a lot of sound and fury in this Macbeth, but not without meaning. It’s not perhaps a very subtle version, and I felt that Kurzel should have perhaps worked more closely with Fassbender with the contours of his speeches, and shown the painful mind-changing and nerve-losing in the early stages. There is an operatic verve.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432270699827/3a80307d-2712-4dde-9e55-67936e63a772-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Macbeth.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432270652843/193c952f-37bf-4e23-9d27-a93c915ca1e7-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"PR","altText":"Macbeth.","cleanCaption":" "},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432270733813/9f9a6fc8-bf74-4798-b40a-ce2857cac226-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"PR","altText":"Macbeth.","cleanCaption":" "}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-23T05:30:09Z","lastModified":"2015-05-23T06:27:51Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":18,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Bradshaw","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterbradshaw"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Film","Culture","William Shakespeare","Paddy Considine","Cannes film festival","Festivals","Marion Cotillard","Michael Fassbender"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/shakespeare","webTitle":"William Shakespeare"},{"id":"film/paddy-considine","webTitle":"Paddy Considine"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"film/marion-cotillard","webTitle":"Marion Cotillard"},{"id":"film/michael-fassbender","webTitle":"Michael Fassbender"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Bradshaw","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterbradshaw"}}],"starRating":"4","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/23/macbeth-review-fassbender-and-cotillard-full-of-sound-and-fury-in-significant-shakespeare-adaptation","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/496vx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/23/macbeth-review-fassbender-and-cotillard-full-of-sound-and-fury-in-significant-shakespeare-adaptation","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/23/macbeth-review-fassbender-and-cotillard-full-of-sound-and-fury-in-significant-shakespeare-adaptation"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432270699827/3a80307d-2712-4dde-9e55-67936e63a772-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Lady Macbeth is embittered, anguished, and her grief is what has become twisted into murderous ambition’ … Macbeth","credit":"PR","altText":"Macbeth.","cleanCaption":"‘Lady Macbeth is embittered, anguished, and her grief is what has become twisted into murderous ambition’ … Macbeth"}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Macbeth review"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Cannes / Who will win the trophies?","rawTitle":"Who will win the trophies?","item":{"type":"article","id":"film/2015/may/22/cannes-2015-peter-bradshaw-predicts-the-award-winners-and-palme-dor","title":"Cannes 2015: Peter Bradshaw predicts the award-winners and Palme d'Or","trailText":"Carol, Son of Saul, Amy, Tale of Tales, Chronic, The Assassin, The Lobster – it’s been an outstanding year at Cannes.

There has been something fascinating and even rather inspiring from a cinephile point of view about the way this film has been so generally and enthusiastically discussed — people have been responding to it as a work of art, and cynicism has been banished. I have enormous admiration and respect for this very beautiful, glacially poised film, although it was sometimes too opaque to capture the heart as well as the head. But what an extraordinary movie.</p> \n<p> Cannes wouldn’t be Cannes without a scandal or storm-in-a-teacup. In 2011, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/may/19/cannes-film-festival-2011-lars-von-trier-banned\">Lars von Trier was declared persona non grata for making wisecracks about Hitler at a press conference</a>. This year it was reported that certain <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes\">women were persona non grata for wearing flat shoes instead of high heels</a>: the offenders were being turned away from red-carpet galas, reports said. </p> \n<p>Asif Kapadia, in a tweet to the Times’s Kate Muir, confirmed that this happened to his wife. Festival director Thierry Fr&eacute;maux dismissed the idea of an anti-flats policy as “unfounded”, although it is clear that the festival’s security staff (who are sometimes prone to come down hard) had been interpreting dress codes in their own way. </p> \n<p>So heelgate came and went, and it is an interesting example of how Cannes, and perhaps the French cultural establishment, is more brisk and less vulnerable to Twitter-shaming and social media brush-fires than are Anglo-Saxons. The same scandal in London or New York, with its overtones of sexual-political malpractice might have resulted in the director having to issue some sort of cowed personal apology, especially as this year is supposed to be the festival’s “year of women”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes\">Cannes faces backlash after women reportedly barred from film screening for not wearing high heels</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> I don’t have disappointments, but I wanted to love Paolo Sorrentino’s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine\">Youth</a>, having found his previous film <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/sep/05/le-grande-bellezza-great-beauty-review\">The Great Beauty</a> such a joy.

(It’s like the silent era, when switching out title cards meant it didn’t matter whether the film came from Berlin or Bognor.) So we have the new adaptation of the popular Saint-Exup&eacute;ry children’s tale, simultaneously presented in two different cinemas at Cannes, in French and English, with entirely different voice casts involved. It was the English one for me, with Jeff Bridges and Rachel McAdams, rather than Andr&eacute; Dussollier and Florence Foresti; however, with Kung Fu Panda’s Mark Osborne on board as director, the artistic balance is definitively tilted in the direction of the Anglo-American crowdpleaser.</p> \n<p>This becomes immediately obvious in the first few minutes. This is not a direct adaptation of The Little Prince – in which an airman crashes his plane in the desert, and then meets a mysterious kid who claims to live on a tiny planet – but, rather, it is inserted into a more conventional one, a Disneyfied empowerment yarn involving a nine-year-old girl whose minutely-monitored life is overturned by a crazily-eccentric elderly next-door neighbour who has, of all things, an ancient biplane in his back garden. Apart from rather obviously taking its cue from Up, the Pixar hit that also involved unconventional methods of air transportation, The Little Prince is a sort of process-movie: each time the next-door airman (for it is he) gives the girl a page from his notebook – complete with Saint-Exup&eacute;ry’s own drawings – it reinforces some point about letting your childlike imagination run free, be true to yourself, anything essential is invisible to the eye, all that sort of thing.</p> \n<p>Osborne’s big stylistic move is to animate the “present” in big-eyed CG – very much in the contemporary manner – and then, when diving into the old man’s increasingly elaborate storytelling, to switch to a very beautiful rustling-paper stop motion technique. It’s a very effective, and very easy on the eye, method of demarcating the two: the former is all muted monochrome, clean lines and razor-sharp focus, while the latter has a highly-coloured sketchiness and crinkle-edged texture that accurately distils the original’s design qualities.<br /></p> \n<p>Where difficulties arise, however, is in the sheer proliferation of narratives and motifs. The superstructure is complex enough in itself – with the girl scrapping with her mother and bonding with the old man as he attempts to get his plane off the ground – and binding it to Saint-Exup&eacute;ry’s own multi-stranded storytelling, with star-collecting businessmen, spirit-guide foxes and desert hikes, is almost too intoxicating a brew. There are at least three false endings as Osborne looks to tie all the layers up in the final 20 minutes, so that when “FIN” drops finally into place, it’s something of a relief. Be that as it may, this is a very good-looking film that represents a brave attempt to do justice to a very popular book; it manages it, just.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431630026556/87eb13f0-e6d8-4f5e-95e4-a990864663a8-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"The Little Prince film still","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T17:29:23Z","lastModified":"2015-05-22T17:29:24Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":9,"contributors":[{"name":"Andrew Pulver","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/andrewpulver"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Cannes film festival","Film adaptations","Antoine de Saint-Exupéry","Animation","Books","Culture","Festivals","Film","Jeff Bridges","Rachel McAdams"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"film/film-adaptations","webTitle":"Film adaptations"},{"id":"books/antoine-de-saint-exupery","webTitle":"Antoine de Saint-Exupéry"},{"id":"film/animation","webTitle":"Animation"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"film/jeff-bridges","webTitle":"Jeff Bridges"},{"id":"film/rachel-mcadams","webTitle":"Rachel McAdams"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Andrew Pulver","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/andrewpulver"}}],"starRating":"3","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/22/the-little-prince-review-cannes-2015-film-saint-exupery-animation","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/496hp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/22/the-little-prince-review-cannes-2015-film-saint-exupery-animation","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/22/the-little-prince-review-cannes-2015-film-saint-exupery-animation"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431630026556/87eb13f0-e6d8-4f5e-95e4-a990864663a8-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A boy and his fox ...

Movies aside, Cannes really does afford an awesome spectacle. The harbour at night, studded with boats like glowworms. The curve of the Croisette, palms trussed up with fairy lights, sand to the left, creamy hotels like wedding cakes to the right. The red carpet in front of the Palais before a premiere, fans stacked six deep screaming for a piece of John C Reilly.</p> \n<p>Yet maybe the most impressive thing you can see is the constant dolling up. Ordinary people totter about the town in full evening wear from dawn to dusk like extras from a prom movie. They pop to the chemist like this; they wolf baguettes propped on litter bins in princess gowns and penguin suits. Most have no place to actually go. They are simply there in the hope of either getting their mitts on a ticket to a movie or a party, or, if already in ownership of such a thing, of making an impact once there.</p> \n<p>Many of these get-ups are high-budget productions: hair stiff with John Frieda, frocks sobbing with diamante, and – of course – Cirque du Soleil stilettos, basically just an insole and a pencil. That security guards this week <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/cannes-film-festival-women-flat-shoes-heels-twitter-backlash\" title=\"\">refused entry to women who dared not to wear these</a> for reasons of comfort, disability or even good taste, is no surprise. Cannes is a marketplace. It flogs movies; it trades people. Its own sell in the increasingly competitive film festival world is to be the most glam, the pinnacle of glitter: all gowns, all the time. Such a mission statement clearly needs policing lest people blow it by rocking up in Crocs.</p> \n<p>The other day I saw a couple of black-tie hopefuls propped up against the window of a patisserie. They weren’t eyeing up the cakes but a life-size chocolate stiletto, frosted with gold, fetish lace detail piped in raspberry icing: a steal at just €33. Though, of course, for them to be of real use on the red carpet, you’d need to buy a pair.</p> \n<h2><strong>Art to break your heart</strong></h2> \n<p><strong> </strong></p> \n<p>I’m writing this in the festival press room, in front of one of the world’s least helpful paintings. It’s of a clock, quite realistic, showing three minutes to eight. One can only imagine the number of minor cardiac moments it has triggered over the past fortnight.</p> \n<p>It’s not the only picture here that haunts your dreams. Running between hotel rooms for various movie junkets offers a strange sort of impromptu gallery tour – one that leaves you in no doubt French hoteliers take greater curatorial risks than their Brit equivalents. Often you’re ushered in front of some celeb only to find your eye caught by the spread-legged nude or dying bison that fills the wall behind them. There’s no respite at home either. Above the bed in our rented flat is an elephant the size of a rowing boat, eyes brimming with grief.</p> \n<h2><strong>That old Woody magic</strong></h2> \n<p><strong> </strong></p> \n<p>In 1986 Michael Caine won an Oscar for his role in <a href=\"http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/hannah-and-her-sisters-1986\" title=\"\">Hannah and Her Sisters</a>. In his new movie, Youth, which premiered here, Caine so much resembles Woody Allen – earth-tone jacket, saggy jowls, black-rimmed specs, bucket hat – that you spend the movie waiting for the next kvetch.</p> \n<p>Woody was in Cannes with a film too, as he is most years, giving a press conference that’s more like a standup gig, squinting at the sun for photographers, doing a few interviews, always amazingly amiable and, for such an apparently neurotic A-lister, very low maintenance. For the Allen fan, eight minutes with the man, including hearing him give his lunch order and seeing him smile mildly at your chicken joke, is just about heaven. Cannes can be gruelling, with the stress and queues and lack of sleep and endless suicide. But that was just magic.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432312249848/Green-high-heels-on-red-c-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'That security guards this week refused entry to women who dared not to wear high heels is no surprise.'

Valentinas claims there were “weekly, often daily calls” with a first-amendment specialist lawyer to ensure that the inflammatory claims were legally sound. “We’ve not had one lawsuit yet,” Hoffman said. “We’ve not even had one threatening letter from anybody.”</p> \n<p>But the content of the film, which covers alleged drug-fuelled parties laid on by an interconnected group of older men to seduce and intoxicate underage actors as well as more personalised stories of abuse, has led to difficulties getting people to see it. It’s been rejected by major film festivals, including London, struggled to find distribution and had to receive cuts to avoid legal action.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JpHUaMBARU\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JpHUaMBARU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s now getting a small release in the US, just 20 cities initially, in the hope it reaches a wider audience in time. The producers also hope it reaches the industry and provokes change. As it currently stands, registered sex offenders are still allowed to work within Hollywood, without difficulty. The film covers the story of actor Brian Peck, who previously worked for Nickelodeon and alongside director Bryan Singer on X-Men and X-Men 2; Peck was convicted of two counts of lewd acts with a child. Peck is now working within the system yet again.</p> \n<p>“Why is he still working on a studio lot when he’s a convicted paedophile?” Valentinas said. </p> \n<p>“Who is checking that? Who is doing the hiring?” Hoffman followed: “We want journalists to ask every single major studio: ‘Why would you allow any convicted paedophile to work in any form with your organisation, period? Why are they any part of what you would ever do?’”</p> \n<p>It’s one of the main changes that the pair want the film to bring about. As well as stricter cross-checking, they want the film to lead to a mandatory minimum sentence for any convicted offenders. The film also explores <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/02/local/la-fi-me-molester-pleads-20120602\">the case of Marty Weiss</a>, a youth-talent manager who was convicted of two charges against Evan Henzi, who alleged that Weiss assaulted him between 30 and 40 times over a five-year period. Weiss ended up serving just six months in prison.</p> \n<p>“I’m angry at the legal system.” Henzi, now 21, said. “I’m starting to understand exactly what happened to me because if I keep it in my head, I’m so confused all the time. I blamed myself and felt guilty. Going back to the beginning, I realised that was not the case and it was just me trying to believe that everyone was good in the world and knew better than me. Now that I’m older, I know it was just sick. You don’t have sex with an 11-year-old kid.”</p> \n<p>Another aim of the film is to help the victims of abuse and prevent them from falling into chemical dependency, alcoholism and further psychological problems. All profits from the film will be going to a foundation set up to provide any necessary support.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/nov/28/ferguson-documentary-america-race-amy-berg-oscar\">Ferguson documentary American Race crowdfunded by Oscar nominee</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Both producers see the film as the start to a long process that will now begin once more people have access to the story.</p> \n<p>“If someone were to go through all the information and depositions, they would see a lot more people,” Hoffman said. “Ask them the questions, see what their story is and make your own judgments. We’re not saying, or implying, that any of those famous people have done bad things, but we’re just saying there are multiple connections which are much more than casual which should generate questions.”</p> \n<p>Given the widespread problem within the industry that was unearthed by the initial research for the film, Hoffman claims there will be more to come.</p> \n<p>“We could have gone further but we don’t want any innuendo,” he said. “This is not the end, this is the beginning to this situation.”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432280505088/c35638e6-febf-4657-bf94-21bb4c00f450-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Youth talent manager Marty Weiss with Evan Henzi, who he was convicted of sexually molesting.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T12:14:51Z","lastModified":"2015-05-22T12:54:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[{"name":"Benjamin Lee","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/benjamin-lee-film"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Film industry","Child protection","Documentary","Film","Culture","Children"],"tags":[{"id":"film/film-industry","webTitle":"Film industry"},{"id":"society/childprotection","webTitle":"Child protection"},{"id":"film/documentary","webTitle":"Documentary"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Benjamin Lee","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/benjamin-lee-film"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/22/an-open-secret-documentary-reveals-paedophilia-in-hollywood","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/496x9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/22/an-open-secret-documentary-reveals-paedophilia-in-hollywood","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/22/an-open-secret-documentary-reveals-paedophilia-in-hollywood"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432280505088/c35638e6-febf-4657-bf94-21bb4c00f450-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Youth talent manager Marty Weiss with Evan Henzi, who he was convicted of sexually molesting.

Miike, of course, is known for churning out an average of three films a year since the early 90s; and was unable to attend this Cannes screening due to having started work on the next one. However, he did send over an amusing short video message apologising for his absence, in which he appeared in full geisha drag, saying that he had switched professions and would never make violent films again.</p> \n<p>That, in truth, was the evening’s high point. When the film itself got underway, it began promisingly enough: Miike whipped up a series of his trademark gruesome fight scenes, as he followed a local crime boss, Kiamura, piloting a young protege, Kagayama, through his neighbourhood – only for us to realise that Kiamura is some sort of vampire yakuza, munching on people’s necks just as they thank him for protecting their business from rival goons. Kiamura can’t resist Kagayama’s perfectly-chiselled throat either, and he becomes turned too – though not before introducing us to the film’s first bit of bizarro comedy business: a basement full of men handcuffed to a set of tables while obsessively knitting. Why ask why? </p> \n<p>Pretty soon, Miike has shoehorned in more plot strands than you can count, and his film lurches wildly, and seemingly at random between them. Vampirism spreads through the locals like a plague, one chomping another in quick succession, with “civilians” transforming to blood-gulping “yakuza” in the blink of an eye. (The remaining (uninfected) yakuza are in what can only be described as a state of consternation, reasoning not without logic that if everyone is a yakuza/vampire, there’ll be no one to extort protection money from.) Kagayama attentively visits the sickbed of a badly-injured girl, with whom he has fallen in love; at the same time, the former captain of his yakuza troop, a glamorous older woman, is tortured by a mysterious dripping noise inside her head. Some sort of beak-faced spirit with halitosis shows up in the knitting basement, while a couple more supernatural goons – one dressed like a 16th century clergyman (complete with ruff) and the other a psychotically violent martial artist – show up from time to time to launch random attacks on Kagayama.</p> \n<p>No doubt to Miike fans this is another example of the delicious stew of genre hybrids he likes to dabble in, but I have to say I didn’t share the uproarious laughter that erupted occasionally around the auditorium. There were one or two mild giggles, to be sure, on the appearance of a much dreaded monster, the “world’s toughest terrorist”, who turns out to be a man in a zip-up frog suit, Honey Monster-style; the frog strikes action poses before beating the hell out of anything that gets in its way. Hilarious. Well, this mess of a film will have its fans, but I can’t say that it will make much headway outside the Miike hardcore.
