Nicloux appears to have developed his project by taking his actors and the fascinating Death Valley setting as a starting point — and hoping that an ending would materialise.</p> \n<p>It has not been much liked here in Cannes, but I found it partly redeemed by watchable turns from G&eacute;rard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert; they have not appeared on screen together since Maurice Pialat’s Loulou in 1980, and Depardieu in particular gives a sweetly tender and understated performance, his best for some years. (The movie is incidentally produced by Sylvie Pialat, Maurice’s widow.) </p> \n<p>D&eacute;pardieu and Huppert play two French actors of a certain age and reputation, a divorced couple respectively called G&eacute;rard and Isabelle; they could either be versions of themselves or conceivably middle-aged versions of the young characters they played in Loulou. </p> \n<p>They have come to Death Valley in eastern California — a stark place of perennial fascination to visiting Europeans ranging from Michelangelo Antonioni to Michel Foucault — because they have been summoned there by two strange messages from beyond the grave. Their son Michael has taken his own life after a depression which he appears to have blamed partly on their neglect of him as a child, and sent them letters commanding them to visit the various Death Valley landmarks on a certain day, and he will “appear” to them. </p> \n<p>Was it Michael’s intention to pre-programme some kind of cathartic confrontation between his parents? Or perhaps to trigger some vengeful, hallucinatory meltdown in the brain-frazzling sun? Are G&eacute;rard and Isabelle effectively drinking the peyote which Michael has laid on for them? As their visit drags on in the intolerable heat, the Death Valley landmarks start to feel like stations of the cross, and they both get weird marks on their limbs that might have been put there by Michael’s ghost.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51fee4103efa52ae77b13940342e15323fe0118c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432269796369/75325690-8b0e-4a11-a23b-6d708449911e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Valley of Love\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This movie does not really follow through with its own ideas, either in the natural realm of the ageing couple’s relationship or the supernatural arena of an eerily possible apparition. Isabelle Huppert’s performance is entirely what was to be expected, and I have to say that there is something semi-intentionally comic in the spectacle of the deadpan Huppert just walking grimly along, radiating fastidious disapproval for everything she sees. (David O Russell got great mileage out of her doing this in I Heart Huckabees 11 years ago.) </p> \n<p>But D&eacute;pardieu is good: a calmer, more reflective, less egomaniacal performance than anything recently and there is something almost heartbreakingly absurd in his whale-like obesity and that plump, cartoony face under a cap he has bought in a local convenience store. He has one rather disturbingly Lynchian scene in which he encounters a disturbing young woman at night, on the floodlit hotel tennis court, and can’t decide if he is dreaming or not. But Nicloux can’t quite follow up these images or ideas. An intriguing but frustrating experience.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432269511813/2c7944e9-04c1-4089-8bd4-8f7db2b67343-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert in Valley of Love.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432269797078/6ac43cd4-23c6-4969-9d22-a7d4d9c22dd6-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" ","credit":"PR","altText":"Valley of Love","cleanCaption":" "}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T04:44:14Z","lastModified":"2015-05-22T09:18:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":28,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Bradshaw","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterbradshaw"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Cannes film festival","Festivals","Culture","Film","Isabelle Huppert","Gérard Depardieu"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"film/isabelle-huppert","webTitle":"Isabelle Huppert"},{"id":"film/gerard-depardieu","webTitle":"Gérard Depardieu"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Bradshaw","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterbradshaw"}}],"starRating":"2","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/22/valley-of-love-review-some-peaks-more-troughs-as-gerard-depardieu-and-isabelle-huppert-hike-death-valley","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/495qz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/22/valley-of-love-review-some-peaks-more-troughs-as-gerard-depardieu-and-isabelle-huppert-hike-death-valley","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/22/valley-of-love-review-some-peaks-more-troughs-as-gerard-depardieu-and-isabelle-huppert-hike-death-valley"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432269511813/2c7944e9-04c1-4089-8bd4-8f7db2b67343-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Was it Michael’s intention to trigger some vengeful, hallucinatory meltdown in the brain-frazzling sun?’ … Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert in Valley of Love.","credit":"PR","altText":"Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert in Valley of Love.","cleanCaption":"‘Was it Michael’s intention to trigger some vengeful, hallucinatory meltdown in the brain-frazzling sun?’ … Gerard Depardieu and Isabelle Huppert in Valley of Love."}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Valley of Love"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Hirokazu Kore-eda / They compare me to Ozu.

It is a drama of sweetness and delicacy derived from the manga Umimachi Diary by Akimi Yoshida, about three adult sisters who have lived together in a house belonging to their grandmother after their parents’ divorce, and who agree to take responsibility for their 13-year-old half-sister after their father’s death.</p> \n<p>This is another of the heartfelt, painful “family dramas” in which Kore-eda now seems to specialise – such as the baby-swap film <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/oct/17/like-father-like-son-review\">Like Father, Like Son</a> (2013), <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/feb/07/i-wish-review\">I Wish</a> (2011), in which two young siblings live apart after their parents’ marital breakdown, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2010/jan/14/still-walking-review\">Still Walking</a> (2008), in which a family is tormented by the loss of a son killed saving another boy from drowning and, indeed, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2004/may/14/cannes2004.cannesfilmfestival\">Nobody Knows</a> (2004), in which a 12-year-old kid has to look after his younger siblings when their mother walks out. The pathos and poignancy has led Kore-eda to be compared to the great master <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/may/12/yasujiro-ozu-japanese-minimalist-autumn-afternoon\">Yasujiro Ozu</a>. I have loved Kore-eda’s work since I saw his strange cult movie <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/1999/oct/03/philipfrench\">After Life</a> (1998), about an imaginary place in which we can choose our happiest memory, and live in it for ever after we die.</p> \n<p>I ask Kore-eda about the importance of absences in families: the painful gaps. “I loved making a story about this,” he replies. “It is important to have a story about a family with some family members missing. But someone else is there, trying to take over the role of parents. They try to reconstruct that family bond. I love that sort of story. It affects me a lot.”</p> \n<p>He goes on to explain that creating and filling gaps is what families are all about: “In the last 15 years, I lost my father, I lost my mother and I have a daughter. I have become a father. So I have realised that we always try to get ‘in between’. Something is missing, so we always try to take over. From the older generation to the next generation.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"790c078fe88028b4fa0ee21e16f0d5c4d905b373\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432221402327/7d2a6812-9a02-469b-a2bd-f42919f660e2-460x258.jpeg\" alt=\"Our Little Sister\" width=\"460\" height=\"258\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delicate drama … Our Little Sister</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I ask about his own family, and his siblings – two older sisters growing up in 60s and 70s Tokyo. Did his parents like cinema? Kore-eda’s eyes light up. “My mother loved films! She adored Ingrid Bergman, Joan Fontaine, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/nov/22/vivien-leigh-life-on-screen\">Vivien Leigh</a>. We couldn’t afford to go together to the cinema, but she was always watching their movies on TV. She stopped all family business or discussions to watch these movies. We would watch together. So I adored film – like her.”</p> \n<p>I ventured to say that his mother must have been delighted when he told her that he wanted to be a movie director. At this idea, Kore-eda laughs and shakes his head. “No. My mother was really against it when I said I wanted to make films. She said that I should be a civil servant. Because that was safe, and it had security. But my mother was always very proud of my movies, and would give videocassettes of them to all the neighbours.”</p> \n<p>And how about his father, I ask. Kore-eda’s smile is replaced with a sombre expression. “My father did not have a lot of security in his life. He did odd jobs. He had a real struggle to make money. He lost a lot of time in his 20s, after the war, because he was sent to a forced-labour camp in Siberia.” Kore-eda’s father was a soldier in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwantung_Army\">Kwantung army</a> in the Japanese puppet state of Manchuria, defeated by Soviet forces in August 1945, a catastrophe for Japan that, almost as much as Hiroshima, hastened the surrender. Despite this formal capitulation, the Soviets treated captured troops as PoWs rather than civilian internees: Kore-eda Sr was one of approximately 500,000 men sent to labour camps. About a tenth of them died out there, and they were not all finally released until the early 1950s. “When he was drunk,” says Kore-eda quietly, “he would always tell us how horrible the Russians were.”</p> \n<p>I ask how he reacts to being compared to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/yasujiro-ozu\">Yasujiro Ozu</a>. “I of course take it as a compliment,” he replies carefully. “I try to say thank you. But I think that my work is more like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikio_Naruse\">Mikio Naruse</a> [the Japanese director of sombre working-class dramas] – and Ken Loach.”</p> \n<p>I can’t resist asking about After Life, and how perplexingly difficult I found it to think of a truly “heavenly” memory in which I might want to spend eternity. Kore-eda smiles and shakes his head a little: “If you can’t choose, it means that you are still alive. Choose, and you’re dead.”</p> \n<p>I mention that my favourite line in his works is said by the amiable slacker dad in I Wish: “Not everything has to be significant. Imagine if everything had meaning. You would choke!” It’s a sublime aesthetic credo. Is he aware of attaching significance to detail in his films?</p> \n<p>“Details are important in a very small and subtle way,” he says. “In Our Little Sister, food is important: for example, when the women speak about the plum wine and the white fish.”</p> \n<p>What food did his mother serve Kore-eda and his sisters? “We used to have prawn tempura: that was my mother’s favourite dish. But she had to go out to work, instead of my father, so she couldn’t find the time to cook nice meals. So we ate more modern food: a lot of frozen and instant food. But I never complained about it to my mother.” It occurs to me that Kore-eda is painting a picture of his home life that is rather different from the formal Ozu-esque poise of his films: the Kore-edas sitting on the couch, eating a ready meal, watching a Joan Fontaine movie on TV.</p> \n<p>But, as Kore-eda says when talking about the incidental details in films, you always have to focus what lies beneath: “What are the characters really talking about?” he says. “Not wine or food … but family.”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432221273994/5e22258a-8272-47eb-832a-557d787d0b57-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Juan Naharro Gimenez/Getty Images","altText":"Hirokazu Kore-eda.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Juan Naharro Gimenez/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432221402507/7d2a6812-9a02-469b-a2bd-f42919f660e2-1020x573.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":573,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Delicate drama … Our Little Sister","credit":"pr","altText":"Our Little Sister","cleanCaption":"Delicate drama … Our Little Sister"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-21T18:09:37Z","lastModified":"2015-05-21T23:00:37Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":11,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Bradshaw","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterbradshaw"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Film","Culture","World cinema","Drama"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/world-cinema","webTitle":"World cinema"},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Bradshaw","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterbradshaw"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/21/hirokazu-kore-director-our-little-sister-interview","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/495ep","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/21/hirokazu-kore-director-our-little-sister-interview","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/21/hirokazu-kore-director-our-little-sister-interview"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432221273994/5e22258a-8272-47eb-832a-557d787d0b57-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘When something is missing in a family, we always try to take over’ … Hirokazu Kore-eda.

It’s a point that was also brought up by Bercot at the start of the festival. “It’s the selection of the film that’s an honor,” she said. “I don’t feel I’ve been given a gift because such a prestigious slot went to a woman.”</p> \n<p>Despite the improvements in gender equality with regards to directors, Fr&eacute;maux did concede that there are still changes to be made behind the scenes. “When I first got to Cannes there were more women in the selection committee,” he said, to the small crowd, “Cannes is but a mirror.”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432201593339/f38eadb5-0684-42bc-87d6-b6ebaea1a0e1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Picture Perfect/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Thierry Frémaux with Cate Blanchett at the premiere of Sicario.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Picture Perfect/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-21T10:24:40Z","lastModified":"2015-05-21T10:54:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":21,"contributors":[{"name":"Benjamin Lee","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/benjamin-lee-film"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Cannes film festival","Festivals","Film","Culture","France","Women"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"world/france","webTitle":"France"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Benjamin Lee","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/benjamin-lee-film"}}],"embeddedVideos":[{"id":"gu-video-456780379","source":"Festival de Cannes / YouTube","durationInSeconds":54,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/19/150519HighHeels_desk.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/19/150519HighHeels.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/5/19/1432049981905/KP_233159_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Actress Emily Blunt on Cannes high heels controversy: its very disappointing  video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Actress Emily Blunt on Cannes high heels controversy: its very disappointing  video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Actress Emily Blunt on Cannes high heels controversy: its very disappointing  video"}}],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/21/cannes-head-thierry-fremaux-oscars-are-more-sexist-than-cannes","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49532","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/21/cannes-head-thierry-fremaux-oscars-are-more-sexist-than-cannes","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/21/cannes-head-thierry-fremaux-oscars-are-more-sexist-than-cannes"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432201593339/f38eadb5-0684-42bc-87d6-b6ebaea1a0e1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Thierry Frémaux with Cate Blanchett at the premiere of Sicario.

There are brilliant flourishes here that could only have come from Sorrentino: superb swooping camera moves, grotesque faces and angular perspectives, and it always watchable. But it’s beset with Sorrentino’s occasional fanboy weakness for pop-star cameos — Paloma Faith appears here, playing herself and not earning her keep. Youth has a wan eloquence and elegance, though freighted with sentimentality and a strangely unearned and uninteresting macho-geriatric regret for lost time, lost film projects, lost love and all those beautiful women that you never got to sleep with. The title has literary resonances with Conrad and Tolstoy, but the youth evoked is mostly that of young women and young women’s bodies, whose allure never fades for men as they get older.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/19/the-brand-new-testament-review-cannes-film-festival-2015\">The Brand New Testament review – God's not dead, just useless, in a sweet and blasphemous satire</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is all incarnated in Michael Caine, whose face here is an inscrutable mask of worldly disillusion, breaking occasionally into a droll smile: he plays retired British composer Fred Ballinger, currently fending off requests from the Palace to conduct a special Royal Command performance of his early masterpiece Simple Songs. (Fred is supposed to have been an intimate of Stravinsky’s — but this music sounds more like Britten pastiche.) He is undergoing a health check-up at this luxurious state-of-the-art sanatorium, although as he says: “At my age, getting in shape is a waste of time.”</p> \n<p>Fred is there with his best buddy Mick (Harvey Keitel) an ageing movie director, here with his production team, brainstorming a new film set to star his old diva friend, played by Jane Fonda. Mick’s son is married to Fred’s daughter and assistant Leda (Rachel Weisz) who actually shares her dad’s bedroom. There is also an LA movie actor Boyle (Paul Dano), another sufferer from that popular condition: self-congratulatory cynicism, who is preparing for a certain historical role, and astonishes everyone at the spa by appearing one morning in full costume and makeup. The two old guys, Mick and Fred, go into a kind of arthouse version of Statler and Waldorf, and they stroll around the grounds, grumping away, torturing themselves by whingeing about their prostate worries and perving over the current Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea) who has won a stay here as part of her prize and turns out to be smarter than anyone thought.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f3h6vr5BdQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5f3h6vr5BdQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There has already been much comment online to the effect that Caine is playing the kind of role that might otherwise have gone to Sorrentino’s longtime collaborator Toni Servillo, and it’s true that Caine’s air of sticken ennui does remind you of Servillo. But actually Caine is very good in the role, he brings something different, a distant fatherly charm.</p> \n<p>If only the film was not so (mostly) marooned in that single location. When the action cuts to memories and fantasies of Venice, where Fred conducted an orchestra, the film suddenly comes alive with power and movement: there is a stunning tableau of St Mark’s Square underwater. Even a very quick scene with Jane Fonda losing her temper on a plane frees things up a bit: but mostly we are drifting around the handsome facilities and grounds of this sumptuous but weirdly soulless open prison with its massages and its heated pools.</p> \n<p>There is a poetic richness in Youth which occasionally emerges as Mick and Fred talk about what they can remember of their lives, and Mick’s realisation that there are huge stretches of his own life that he can simply no longer remember: his own youth is more or less a complete blank. It is an idea which is more terrifying than piquant: more disturbing, arguably, than anything Mastroianni’s director faced in 8 &frac12; — though he himself had youth more or less on his side.</p> \n<p>Sorrentino has a basic level of fluency and verve. Anything that this film-maker places in front of his camera is always arresting to some extent: there is a superb shot in which Fred and Mick spy on an elderly couple having sex in a forest: a shot replete with comedy, absurdity and alienation. I am already looking forward to another more substantial Sorrentino film, though there is pathos here, and sweetness. </p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432117182775/2b61a65b-76ad-4da5-8c84-2172e0b23b05-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel in Youth","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T10:45:49Z","lastModified":"2015-05-20T23:00:38Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":56,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Bradshaw","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterbradshaw"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Youth","Cannes 2015","Paolo Sorrentino","Michael Caine","Rachel Weisz","Film","Culture","Cannes film festival","Drama","Festivals"],"tags":[{"id":"film/youth","webTitle":"Youth"},{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/paolo-sorrentino","webTitle":"Paolo Sorrentino"},{"id":"film/michael-caine","webTitle":"Michael Caine"},{"id":"film/rachel-weisz","webTitle":"Rachel Weisz"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Bradshaw","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterbradshaw"}}],"starRating":"3","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/494xv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432117182775/2b61a65b-76ad-4da5-8c84-2172e0b23b05-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘He has a wan eloquence and elegance” ...
