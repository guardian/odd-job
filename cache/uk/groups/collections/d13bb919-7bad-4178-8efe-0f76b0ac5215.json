The throngs of ticket-hunters are getting ever denser outside the Palais; the weekend dog-walkers are out in force on the Croisette, their mutts ever tinier but the leads ever longer; and in a packed press conference room, Woody Allen is answering the now mandatory annual question about his globe-trotting habits. “When are you going to shoot in Rio, Woody?” asks a Brazilian journalist. (The year Woody Allen brings a favela movie to Cannes is the year I’ll decide to stay home.)</p> \n<p>The Cannes film festival is in session, for the 68th time – and yet, it won’t really be properly under way until either the critics have swooned en masse over some blue-chip masterpiece, or something really outrageous gets us all flustered – and since Lars von Trier is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/may/19/cannes-film-festival-2011-lars-von-trier-banned\">no longer welcome here</a>, we’ll have to rely on French scandalist Gaspar No&eacute; and his reputedly ultra-graphic 3D sex film <em>Love</em>, screening later this week. Perhaps the Palais will relax its evening dress code for this one – glasses mandatory, raincoats optional.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72cf8fc1a89ea1d4d273c12c7e8df26e09fc0eb4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431706233688/7a0c4b38-c770-436c-981e-e45fc280492d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Son of Saul\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">L&aacute;szl&oacute; Nemes’s Son of Saul: ‘terrifying, intellectually provocative work, audacious in its rethinking of Holocaust drama’.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>No&eacute; aside, it does look as if this year’s event is opting to be a little more sober than we usually expect. That was certainly the keynote set by opening-night offering <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/13/la-tete-haute-review-catherine-denueve-cannes-2015\"><strong>La T&ecirc;te Haute</strong></a><em> </em>(Standing Tall), a very low-key, rather Loachian French film about a teenage boy and the juvenile justice system. OK, it does star the ever-regal <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/catherinedeneuve\">Catherine Deneuve</a>, but given recent razzle-dazzle first-nighters such as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/the-great-gatsby\"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a>, Emmanuelle Bercot’s film seems a little downbeat to be raising champagne flutes to: an affecting though unsurprising social drama with Deneuve as a firm but motherly judge watching over a troubled teenager, played by newcomer Rod Paradot. One can only assume this choice was the festival’s way of distancing itself from the snobbish, hollow glitz of last year’s reviled opener <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/grace-of-monaco\"><em>Grace of Monaco</em></a>.</p> \n<p>So far, little has provided huge excitement – although it was a thrill to see the hyper-frenetic, genuinely inspired <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/mad-max-fury-road\"><strong>Mad Max: Fury Road</strong></a>, which felt like the festival’s real curtain-raiser. We’ve had a couple of blasts of eccentricity in competition, but I wish I could have liked them better. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/matteo-garrone-tale-of-tales-glowing-reviews-cannes\"><strong>Tale of Tales</strong></a> is by Italian director Matteo Garrone, who made the intensely gritty Mafia film <em>Gomorrah</em>, but this English-language oddity is a quixotic misfire. Based on a 17th-century text, it features a mismatched international cast (Salma Hayek, John C Reilly, Vincent Cassel, Shirley Henderson) in a floridly baroque hotchpotch of stories about kings and queens, sea-beasts and spells – and a giant flea. A triumph of design and photography (it’s shot by Peter Suschitzky), it resembles a deluxe version of those cheap-and-cheerful East German children’s films, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAF3fWo8aoM\"><em>The Singing Ringing Tree</em></a> that livened up BBC teatimes in the 70s. Yet what genuine magic Garrone musters is drowned out by the creaking of the English dialogue. As bloated as the flea that becomes King Toby Jones’s beloved pet in the film’s jolliest episode, this oddball epic is a brave venture – but in the self-aware, revisionist post-<em>Shrek</em> era, you can’t help feeling this fairytale is a little, well, ogre-ist.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456642988__\n</div> \n<p>Odder still was <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/the-lobster\"><strong>The Lobster</strong></a>, the first English-language film by Yorgos Lanthimos, whose sublimely skewed <em>Dogtooth</em> spearheaded Greek cinema’s so-called <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/aug/27/attenberg-dogtooth-greece-cinema\">weird wave</a>. Now, there’s outre and there’s outre, but <em>The Lobster</em> feels too strenuously odd: it has WTF hand-stitched all over it in fine silk thread. It’s set in a hotel where single people must find a partner or turn into an animal. Another heteroclite cast (Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, L&eacute;a Seydoux, John C Reilly again) give alienatingly affectless readings of non-sequitur lines – it feels like an extended <em>Monty Python</em> sketch with Peter Greenaway dialogue. There is some genuine inspiration to Lanthimos’s violent social satire, but overall this feels less like a coherent film than a laboriously executed conceptual art piece. <em>The Lobster</em> is fatally bound in the carapace of its own surrealism. Still, you do get hear Olivia Colman singing Gene Pitney.</p> \n<p>So far, there’s one film I’d tip as a serious Palme d’Or contender, and that may prove the most challenging in the fest. Hungarian film <strong>Son of Saul</strong> is a Holocaust drama by first-time writer-director L&aacute;szl&oacute; Nemes, formerly assistant to maestro of super-slow austerity B&eacute;la Tarr. The film is as daunting as that suggests. It involves a prisoner in Auschwitz who thinks he recognises a dead boy as his son, and desperately searches for a rabbi to bury him. The taboo that once hovered over depicting Holocaust imagery in fiction films has been somewhat dispelled of late, for better or worse, by films such as <em>Schindler’s List</em> (better, arguably) and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/life-is-beautiful\"><em>Life Is Beautiful</em></a> (worse, much worse). But Nemes makes the singular decision to mount vast, detailed tableaux of the camp’s horrors, only to keep these images half-obscured and in the background, somewhere behind his protagonist (G&eacute;za R&ouml;hrig), whose haunted features fill the foreground for most of the time. The complex action, filmed in long takes, at once immerses us in events and keeps us at a distance, casting a disturbing slant on the story of a man who tries to make a profound symbolic gesture in the face of death, while seemingly blind to the slaughter going on all around him. It’s a terrifying, intellectually provocative work, audacious in its rethinking of Holocaust drama, and if it’s not the Palme, it certainly deserves to be seen and talked about widely.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"749396a2e49424404548baaece197395b5bfeb91\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431705878817/9ef57655-4dd0-430f-84a4-743a03af57d5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"La T&ecirc;te Haute \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opener La T&ecirc;te Haute (Standing Tall): ‘A very low-key, rather Loachian French film about a teenage boy and the juvenile justice system’.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Of late, watching the latest Woody Allen has become one of those annual Cannes chores you steel yourself for, but you never quite get used to how joyless the experience can be. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/irrational-man\"><strong>Irrational Man</strong></a> is <em>Crime and Punishment </em>laboriously reimagined as a campus drama about a glamorously tormented academic (Joaquin Phoenix), who finds a new lease of life in planning a murder: “This is the meaningful act I’ve been searching for!” This is not Allen at his very worst, but it’s painfully mechanical. It feels like a bad student parody of Allen in his moral-philosophy mode, or like something he once would have sent up in one of his <em>New Yorker</em> squibs. Only Emma Stone’s ingenue vivacity survives uncrushed through lines like, “Despair is what Kierkegaard called ‘the sickness unto death’, Abe.” <em>Irrational Man</em> left me feeling if not sick unto death, at least – as Woody would once have said – a, a, a little nauseous.</p> \n<p>While British cinema is conspicuous here by its near-absence, a standout documentary this year is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/02/amy-asif-kapadia-documentary-amy-winehouse\"><strong>Amy</strong></a>, Asif Kapadia’s chronicle of the brief glory of Amy Winehouse. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/01/mitch-winehouse-interview-amy-documentary-film\">The singer’s family has objected to the film</a>, but whatever conclusions Kapadia might lead us to draw about her relationship with them, and with her self-consciously bad-boy ex Blake Fielder-Civil, the film eschews direct commentary to present a well-judged montage of clips showing Winehouse as a deeply characterful talent who simply wasn’t equipped for the temptations and traumas of sudden success. The tragedy of her fall is especially brought home by such material as an early <em>Friday Night With Jonathan Ross</em> appearance in which her joie de vivre and cheek fairly blaze out of the screen.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2015/5/15/1431705578215/Colin-Farrell-and-Rachel--010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Colin

The film is based on Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel The Price of Salt, about the love affair between a virginal shopgirl and the beautiful older married woman that she serves in the pre-Christmas rush in a Manhattan department-store: they are played here by Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett. Just occasionally, along with the classic echoes, Carol has the obsessive frisson of Nic Roeg’s Bad Timing and – with the flourishing of a revolver – Haynes conjures a fraught kind of Nabokovian despair and futile melodrama.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/13/cate-blanchett-reveals-her-many-past-relationships-with-women\">Cate Blanchett reveals 'many' past relationships with women</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is a creamily sensuous, richly observed piece of work, handsomely detailed and furnished: the clothes, the hair, the automobiles, the train carriages, the record players, the lipstick and the cigarettes are all superbly presented. The combination of all this is intoxicating in itself.</p> \n<p>Rooney Mara is Therese, unaffectedly pretty, ambitious but callow: self-deprecating and watchful in ways that make working in a department store congenial. She wants to be a photographer, and is saddled with a platonic fianc&eacute; Richard (Jake Lacy), with whom she has made vague plans to travel to Europe. Therese perpetually affects a silly beret with a kind of pompom and has a faintly dysfunctional fringe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13893684fb3719cf1c5daf2fa75eb4fa3070544b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431808724857/48b7ef56-a950-4e80-9c50-a9a29e4cbb58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"CAROL Carol and Harge dancing. Carol....Film Still.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>When Cate Blanchett’s Carol first appears in the department store she is wearing furs: she is a predator, though a haughtily self-contained one. She has the air of a very dangerous animal that has just been hit with a tranquilliser dart. Accidentally on purpose, Carol leaves her gloves behind at the store, having chatted flirtatiously with Therese and ordered from her a train-set for her daughter, an item so big that it has to be delivered, which gives Carol an excuse to leave her address with Therese. And so their affair begins, in the traditional, bygone way of a long lunch in a restaurant booth with the food being accompanied with martinis.</p> \n<p>There is no arch knowingness or camp in the movie, except perhaps in one scene in which Carol has dressed the Christmas tree in the family home from which her husband and child are absent, and now sits with elaborate casualness on the floor, wrapping some extremely tasteful and expensive present, while the yet unseduced Therese picks out a tune on Carol’s piano. Soon, of course, they are to go on a trip together, staying demurely in adjoining motel cabins until one day they impulsively take the “presidential suite” and their intimacy advances.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3d4bffda1164c7c68f6ed60b5519f27fb690e58\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431808940993/a17002a2-6b7a-4881-ab4d-ed6eb4370a52-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Carol film still\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>But Haynes shows that the point is that Therese has appeared in Carol’s life at a desperately dangerous moment. Her marriage with the possessive Harge (stolidly played by Kyle Chandler) is crumbling: he already resents her closeness to a former lover Abby (Sarah Paulson) – and of course boorishly hates himself for not having punished his errant wife more emphatically for this liaison – and is on the point of taking Carol’s infant daughter away from her in a custody battle. So it is not merely that Therese is to be Carol’s lover; she is to be a quasi-daughter, too.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/carol-film-cannes-karlsen-cate-blanchett\">Passion project: meet the indie super-producer behind Cannes hot ticket Carol</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This is such an outstandingly intelligent movie, which takes us within the narcotic clouds of depression and self-control with which Carol has managed her life: hers is a prototypical version of Betty Friedan’s Feminine Mystique, announced a decade after this. As for Therese, there is less enigma surrounding her, and the film is concerned to show us that there is no Ripley-esque parasitism in her attachment to the older woman. This is an affair of equals, or perhaps it is rather that Therese has a maturity which the showy, nervily insecure Carol does not have. It is a generational love, and a generational conflict between two women, one of whom does not have, or does not realise she has, the option of a professional career.</p> \n<p>Haynes’s drama shows the corsetry, and the mystery, and the way in which gay people could in fact in the 1950s negotiate their lives with dignity. I confess don’t love Carol as much as loved Far From Heaven, and perhaps it does not have that demonic flourish that came partly from pastiche.

Hayek added that the casting process was “very sexist”. She recalled one role for which she was sought by a director, who put her forward for consideration by the male lead. “They get approval of leading ladies. The dude didn’t approve me and I got kicked out.”</p> \n<p>But a positive note was sounded by Carol co-producer Elizabeth Karslen. She championed the likes of The Fault in Our Stars and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for subverting stereotypes and giving voice to oft-marginalised demographics. She also said she thought longterm organic change was inevitable. “It wasn’t that long ago we got the vote.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9600e007d0b37e928d1b02e81eea156948a3c607\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431815004221/bf7fe1d9-e546-496d-b9e5-83b6bd454a3f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Karlsen speaks onstage.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elizabeth Karlsen speaks onstage.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for Variety</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Karlsen called upon other bodies to pull their weight for gender equality, including journalists and the British Board of Film Classification. She attacked the BBFC’s decision to award Made in Dagenham (about the female strike at the Ford factory which helped overhaul the employment laws) a 15-rating on account of its language. “The Social Network was a 12A. If you want to take a whole generation of young girls to teach them about social history you can’t. Instead they can see a movie in which women have coke snorted off them. The censorship bodies need to think beyond the word ‘fuck’.”</p> \n<p>Yet for all the rallying cries, the conclusion seemed to be that the film industry had a long way to go before gender equality was in sight. Said Vachon: “I’m so used to being patronised it doesn’t really bother me. I take it in strides. It’s part of the job.”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431814695750/405ac36b-2e3c-456c-8676-85155028a3e8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for Variety","altText":"Salma Hayek at the panel discussion.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for Variety"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431814802053/91cc4be7-88bc-43e4-a786-de2bfb1f9ef7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Christine Vachon and Aishwarya Rai at the summit.

Last week the hallowed French film star <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/13/catherine-deneuve-social-media-has-stopped-people-dreaming-about-stars\">Catherine Deneuve</a> claimed it was not possible for modern audiences “to dream any more” about the stars on the screen. “Being a star entails glamour and secrecy,” she said in Cannes. “You have to keep something for yourself. You shouldn’t display everything of your private life. You see so many pictures, so many images – it’s hard to keep some degree of mystery.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4a33fcaa67dc172527eef8159bd67d9e133bb77f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431794103428/fcba94c6-faa0-468e-a581-0f133c7d628c-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Cate Blanchett caused a sensation at Cannes.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cate Blanchett caused a sensation at Cannes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cate Blanchett probably has some sympathy with Deneuve’s lament. Her new film Carol, a lesbian love story based on the 1952 Patricia Highsmith novel <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/books/dp/1469971879\">The Price of Salt</a>, has its premiere on Sunday night and the Oscar-winning actress, who stars alongside Rooney Mara, is due to make her appearance in front of the Palais du Festival with her co-star.</p> \n<p>According to the film’s director, Todd Haynes, having both actresses together on the red carpet for the launch is of “huge value” to his film – a difficult sell to wider audiences because of the lesbian theme. But for Blanchett the association with Carol may have already become uncomfortably close. In the runup to the festival, when Blanchett was asked if she had had same-sex relationships before, the married mother of four simply replied: “Yes, many times.” Cue a media feeding frenzy.</p> \n<p>But for one of the film’s producers, Briton Stephen Woolley, the focus on the stars is wholly positive. “Stars have always had enormous influence. People can be snobbish about them, but it is what we all love really. And Cate is fantastic because she makes indie films and big Hollywood productions. Having her here means that the film will reach a wider audience.”</p> \n<p>Deneuve identified the rise of social media as one of the prime reasons for the loss of mystique. For Gavin Smith, editor of New York’s Film Comment, the proliferation of stories, blogs, images and tweets is altering the equilibrium of the star system, but it still exists.</p> \n<p>“Some stars keep quiet and others, like James Franco, tweet a lot. Twitter and the internet have created a lot of micro-stars,” he said. “They are still there, though the constellation is more populous and some may not last as long. Careers are measured by the number of followers they have.”</p> \n<p>As the star debate swept the Croisette, festival director Thierry Fr&eacute;maux decreed an impromptu ban on “selfies”, arguing: “You never look as ugly as you do in a selfie.”</p> \n<p>Perhaps more than anywhere, Cannes thrives in direct relation to the amount of old world glamour it can summon up against the forces of the modern world.</p> \n<p>Luckily for Fr&eacute;maux, the public is still under Cannes’s spell, with tourists snapping themselves in front of the festival’s Palme d’Or logo and even taking screen grabs inside the cinemas. Even in the first few days of the festival, female Hollywood stars have shone on the red carpet as much, if not more, than they have on screen, making the most of their moment of self-promotion and glamour.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/review-emma-stone-does-her-best-to-bring-woody-allens-irrational-man-to-life\">Emma Stone, who has a lead role in Woody Allen’s new film Irrational Man</a>, and <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/the-lobster-review-colin-farrell-rachel-weisz-1201496633/\">Rachel Weisz, whose new film, <em>The Lobster</em></a>, also had its premiere on Friday, both knew how to play their press conferences.

She has expressed her honour at getting the prestigious role, but her weight as a creative expert was undermined at a press conference when a fellow juror, musician Rokia Traor&eacute;, was described as “beautiful enough to be an actress”.</p> \n<p>Looks clearly remain a central part of the job description of a star at Cannes 2015, whether it is the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3081772/Miranda-Kerr-laps-attention-showcases-supermodel-figure-glitzy-black-skirt-ice-cream-launch-Cannes-Film-Festival.html\">model Miranda Kerr</a> launching a new ice-cream on the beach or Isabella Rossellini, star of independent foreign cinema, being brought up short by the huge image of her mother, Ingrid Bergman, on this year’s festival poster. “Yesterday, as I was walking up the red carpet, with Mama enormous, I got up to Thierry Fr&eacute;maux. I said ‘Thierry, I don’t miss her any more. Thirty years since she died, she’s so present. It’s wonderful,’” she said.</p> \n<p>Other screen idols are doing a clever job in avoiding the over-exposure of which Deneuve warns. A leading Hollywood producer spoke admiringly of the way Leonardo DiCaprio handles his image. “The thing is not to do too much in the public eye and Leo understands this. He keeps himself private and then suddenly he is everywhere when he needs to be,” he said.</p> \n<p>He didn’t think the selfie had changed things, but rather TV shows and websites devoted to unbuttoning the stars in public.

Buy, who previously worked for Moretti on his Berlusconi biopic The Caiman, and his papal satire We Have a Pope, plays a film-maker called Margherita, who is in the middle of shooting a very un-Moretti-like film about a violent workers’ protest at a factory threatened by closure. Moretti said: “I never thought the protagonist could be a man; the main character had to be a woman. But it’s true there’s a lot of me in Margherita, while [her brother] Giovanni is the person I would like to be (and the person Margherita would like to be too).”</p> \n<p>My Mother follows Margherita as her film shoot becomes beset by personal troubles, notably the worsening condition of her ailing mother, a former classical scholar. Moretti’s own family background appears to hew closely to Margherita’s: his mother Agata, a much-respected Latin teacher who appeared in Moretti’s autobiographical 1998 feature Aprile, died in 2010; while his brother Franco is a celebrated literature professor. Margherita even sits through a press conference in the film remarkably similar to the one Moretti is conducting. To confuse the situation even more, Moretti himself takes the role of Margherita’s capable brother Giovanni. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1c807e4f8608b65c9effcbeb18692a85798bd9b4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431779984916/52a7a09a-7b40-49e8-aa2e-385c9c2d604d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mia Madre (My Mother) film still\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margherita Buy in Mia Madre</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But Moretti insisted that Margherita was a very distinct film-making personality from his own. “Her film is different from one of mine. She is anxious, irritable, afraid she wasn’t up to it. I thought it would be interesting to give these characteristics to a woman rather than a man – they are very different to the caring qualities that are given to most women characters. Her mind is always somewhere else, and she finds it very different to keep control for her life.”</p> \n<p>Moretti also cast American actor John Turturro, to play the role of an American actor in Margherita’s film. Saying he had first met Moretti at Cannes several years previously, Turturro professed himself delighted to be involved. “I don’t do job just by the part, it’s who you are going to work with. I read the script and thought the role had relevance to my own life. It was a very full experience for me.”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431779767989/6e889d5a-3e36-4906-be13-cbb96717c7b7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"BERTRAND LANGLOIS/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Italian director and actor Nanni Moretti talks during a press conference for the film \"Mia Madre\" (My Mother) at the 68th Cannes Film Festival.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: BERTRAND LANGLOIS/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431779985591/409c4c65-5528-4809-8351-53d1ec21d5f0-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Margherita Buy in Mia Madre Photograph: PR","credit":"PR","altText":"Mia Madre (My Mother) film still","cleanCaption":"Margherita Buy in Mia Madre","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-16T12:57:54Z","lastModified":"2015-05-16T13:23:37Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":5,"contributors":[{"name":"Andrew Pulver","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/andrewpulver"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Nanni Moretti","Film","Cannes film festival","Italy","Drama","Comedy","Comedy","Culture","Europe","Festivals","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/nanni-moretti","webTitle":"Nanni Moretti"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"world/italy","webTitle":"Italy"},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama"},{"id":"film/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy"},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Andrew Pulver","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/andrewpulver"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/16/cannes-2015-nanni-moretti-mia-madre-my-mother-film-john-turturro","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49x8e","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/16/cannes-2015-nanni-moretti-mia-madre-my-mother-film-john-turturro","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/16/cannes-2015-nanni-moretti-mia-madre-my-mother-film-john-turturro"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431779767989/6e889d5a-3e36-4906-be13-cbb96717c7b7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nanni Moretti at the press conference for My Mother at the Cannes film festival Photograph: BERTRAND LANGLOIS/AFP/Getty Images","credit":"BERTRAND LANGLOIS/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Italian director and actor Nanni Moretti talks during a press conference for the film \"Mia Madre\" (My Mother) at the 68th Cannes Film Festival.","cleanCaption":"Nanni Moretti at the press conference for My Mother at the Cannes film festival","cleanCredit":"Photograph: BERTRAND LANGLOIS/AFP/Getty Images"}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Nanni Moretti"},"showQuotedHeadline":true},{"title":"Cannes uncovered / Day 4 - the boos, the controversy, the ice cream!","rawTitle":"Day 4 - the boos, the controversy, the ice cream!","item":{"type":"article","id":"film/filmblog/2015/may/16/cannes-uncovered-day-4","title":"Cannes uncovered: day 4 - the boos, the controversy, the ice cream!","trailText":"Gus Van Sant’s new film gets trashed while we end up partying with a drag queen and her ice cream on the beach","standFirst":"<p>Gus Van Sant’s new film gets trashed while we end up partying with a drag queen and her ice cream on the beach</p>","byline":"Benjamin Lee","body":"<p>The weekend has arrived at Cannes and so have the hangovers.

While we’re still waiting for any big streaming purchases, there has been a small amount of backlash at this year’s festival. Yesterday saw Ted Sarandos, Netflix’s chief content officer, give a talk about the company’s plans which resulted in a rather awkward heckle from a French journalist. Sarandos was asked if he was aware that the Netflix model would “destroy the film ecosystem in Europe”. It’s a reference to the fact that, unlike other broadcasters, Netflix don’t contribute to European film subsidies. He was defended by Harvey Weinstein who grabbed the mic and called Netflix “a visionary company”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"803c795ca8320037278c9884fcc02a38f7385df7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431766091111/5f872f9c-56d4-4cb1-95af-43e900f60913-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Woody Allen at yesterday's press conference for 'Irrational Man.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Woody Allen at yesterday’s press conference for ‘Irrational Man.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristan Fewings / Pool/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Elsewhere at the fest, Woody Allen referred to his decision to make a series for Amazon Prime as a “catastrophic mistake”. The director said: “I’m struggling with it at home. I never should have gotten into it. I thought it was going to be easy. You do a movie and it’s a big long thing; to do six half-hours you’d think would be a cinch.

Amy, which has just screened today, is a look at the troubled singer’s life from singing as a teen to her tragic death from alcohol poisoning at 27, and like Kapadia’s last film, Senna, it’s a hit with critics. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece\">Peter Bradshaw gave it five stars</a> and called it “stunningly moving”. Others agreed:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Hen Amy tweet\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-cards=&quot;hidden&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;\n &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Amy: the kind of doc that pulls everyone - parents, the media, fans - up short.

The film heavily implies that Mitch shared some culpability for his daughter’s decline. Mitch and Amy’s mum, Janis, were two of the 80 people Kapadia interviewed for the film, but the family have disassociated themselves from the project. Keep an eye out for Kapadia’s response.</p> \n<h2>The offbeat party</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a467131bb226ee714aabddc6aae06555ee5e9d58\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431766540333/0adf5574-db2a-475d-8abf-900246a7538a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\" “I use my mouth for money” ...

Last night, we made our way to a rather unlikely do, hosted by Magnum. The ice cream brand has dominated the fest and already seen ambassador Miranda Kerr nab some column inches by wearing a dress at a party or something. This more low-key event was to launch a new series of shorts, headed by Willam, a drag queen who gained fame on RuPaul’s Drag Race and roles on Nip/Tuck and Sex and the City. It meant free champagne and FREE ICE CREAM on the beach.</p> \n<p>As is standard with these sorts of parties, you’re often surrounded by people curiously looking over your shoulder to see if there’s someone cooler to talk to, which usually wasn’t us. We did get a chance to speak to Willam herself, in the hope that she might fall into the classic “eager starlet will do anything to get noticed at Cannes” category but she was surprisingly un-Sean Youngy.</p> \n<p>“I’m a novelty at best and I don’t think I could do anything more to impress than the actual stars like Lupita and Charlize,” she said. Her somewhat rocky past (“I’ve been to jail. It was called battery of a cohabitant but we’re not talking about that”) was smoothed over by a mixture of chocolate, ice cream and toppings. The oddity of the event highlighted the sheer variety of events happening in the town that might often have absolutely nothing to do with the actual festival. </p> \n<p>In important news, I was told I would make a “medium” drag queen.</p> \n<h2>The classy yacht name</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cd5039dcf8f07572a52047f0f544c9b0cd610a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431763387574/efad1631-e87a-49c7-bc55-60e56813ffc1-460x345.jpeg\" alt=\"Keeping it classy.\" width=\"460\" height=\"345\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keeping it classy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Catherine Shoard</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Okay so unless it’s owned by the hip hop trio of the same name, it’s a no from us.</p> \n<h2>The selfie ban rule-breaker</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7075d127e3ba2046a5ac52906335fbd6095b342c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431764172065/51d0d269-5063-4fa6-9ca7-8751b6e59773-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An eager fan takes a selfie with Woody Allen.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An eager fan takes a selfie with Woody Allen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Regis Duvignau/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Our daily look at stars ignoring festival head Thierry Fr&eacute;maux’s no selfie rule has unearthed a corker today with an enthusiastic fan forcing an extremely uninterested Woody Allen to burn the rule book. </p> \n<h2>The “wait, what?” film</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aaefd1f664e1b2de6cb5c726ffda6d065b9c63c8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431763813144/eec07a8d-ef0d-4812-adc6-56e455d92c08-295x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Millionaire Dog\" width=\"295\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Millionaire Dog</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You know you’re in for a treat when the first-billed star is a dog called Cook.

At some stage as a teenager, Winehouse adopted her feline eyeliner style — a style that Caitlin Moran has written about brilliantly, the kind of makeup you develop through applying it while looking into a car or bus wing-mirror.<br /></p> \n<p>It’s a movie that responds instantly to Winehouse’s music and to the mystery of her voice: a rich Sarah Vaughan style that seemed to belong to a much older woman. This would switch, off-mike, to her speaking voice: eloquent and seductive, the unashamed, unpretentious, utterly relaxed sound of north London. (Jonathan Ross is shown congratulating her on sounding “common”: and actually, his identifying the elephant in the room was to the point — although the film does not press the point of how that rich singing voice just seemed to surge up from nowhere.) </p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456642988__\n</div> \n<p>The film also responds to Winehouse’s face: that sensual and jolie-laide presence, always so mobile and yet possessed of a strange kind of anti-Mona-Lisa enigma. There is a fantastic scene where Kapadia shows Winehouse’s face almost twitching and popping with bored disdain while an inane interviewer insists on asking her about Dido.</p> \n<p>We start with Amy’s teen years, circling back to a troubled though hardly deprived childhood in which she was deeply affected, first by her father Mitch walking out on the family — and then later, just as deeply affected by his returning to becoming a strange sort of intrusive, ineffective and almost parasitic Svengali to her career. It was Mitch who crucially advised Amy against going into rehab, a decision which Amy herself noted in her great song, replete with agony, betrayal and self-doubt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUmZp8pR1uc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KUmZp8pR1uc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>All of these advisers, promoters and managers jostle to assure us that they themselves were not responsible for Amy Winehouse’s descent into drugs and overwork, and Kapadia simply lets us make our own mind up, although it is the hapless Mitch who appears in the darkest light, despite having the most heartbreakingly good intentions. All through her life, Amy was desperate to devote herself to a strong male protective figure: either Mitch, or her equally troubled and charmless husband Blake Fielder-Civil, who appears to have introduced her to hard drugs and a co-dependent, dysfunctional relationship in which he perpetually resented his own insignificance. There is a harrowing voicemail message in which Amy offers “unconditional love”, her voice pulsing with loneliness — a kind of musicless torch song in itself. One of the film’s bleakest moments shows Amy saucer-eyed at a London event, watching the Grammys on television, and at the moment she wins, taking a friend aside to confess that this whole thing is “so boring without drugs”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A97-pQJD6Hw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/A97-pQJD6Hw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch a teaser trailer\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/02/amy-asif-kapadia-documentary-amy-winehouse\">Amy: first look at Asif Kapadia's documentary on Amy Winehouse</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Inevitably, it is the song Rehab itself which is Winehouse’s personal and musical moment of destiny, the moment of almost diabolic inspiration and autobiography and automythology which triggered her supernova of fame. The idea of defiantly not going into rehab challenged a celeb-pap industry which always slavered spitefully over famous people getting punished for their gilded lives by being unhappy. But Winehouse’s attack on the hypocrisy of the whole business, and also the song’s personal ambiguity and complexity, were misunderstood. Her USP became not going into rehab, and being devoted to excess.
