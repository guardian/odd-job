It’s like being on holiday and bumping into your entire office. In shorts. The streets are filled with very loud industry types, trying to outbrag each other with tales of parties you haven’t been invited to. There are free copies of Variety and The Hollywood Reporter littering the pavement. Hotels are draped in posters for films that haven’t even been made jostling for attention. Yet close-by, there’s a group of old men trying to play their daily game of bowls. It all makes no sense.</p> \n<p>While the festival has steered towards a more native set of films this year, there’s still a slight backlash to the Hollywood influence. Yesterday we spotted this rather odd piece of street art which seems to be taking aim at jury heads the Coen brothers although if you can figure out exactly what it all means, do let us know:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01596affaf33701cf46da420da0a700d65684503\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431847182430/7182e341-b378-48b0-8623-66f6488e51ad-315x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Coens\" width=\"315\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<h2>The big film</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9e1e3089979ff92622cd369f943e8176d5b0de8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431859836552/b143d642-852c-4feb-9da2-abc9776de317-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cate Blanchett, Todd Haynes and Rooney Mara at this morning’s photo call for Carol.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cate Blanchett, Todd Haynes and Rooney Mara at this morning’s photo call for Carol.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thibault Camus/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Well, we hate to say “we told you so” but we totally told you so. Given the pedigree it might not be a total surprise to have predicted that Carol would be the runaway awards contender of the fest but still, it’s pleasing to see just how much everyone loves Todd Haynes’s latest. His adaptation of Patricia Highsmith’s novel The Price of Salt stars Cate Blanchett as a housewife who falls for a virginal department store worker, played by Rooney Mara, in 50s New York. It’s beautifully realised, handsomely directed and stunningly acted and one PR told us he’d never seen so many critics in tears at a screening. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/16/carol-review-cate-blanchett-captivates-in-woozily-obsessive-lesbian-romance\">Peter Bradshaw gave it five stars</a> and called it “creamily sensuous” while here’s what others had to say:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/filmnickjames/statuses/599652480591343616\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Todd Haynes's CAROL fulfills it's promise for me, full of magnificent tenderness. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cannes2015?src=hash\">#Cannes2015</a></p>— Nick James (@filmnickjames) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/filmnickjames/status/599652480591343616\">May 16, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<h2><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/nigelmfs/statuses/599652197756968961\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Todd Haynes' CAROL is transporting.

Today’s press conference for the film saw the stars and director field questions about the film and the predictably discussed sex scene between the pair. Mara joked: “I’m nude quite often so it wasn’t a big deal to me”. Blanchett also addressed the recent story where she was quoted as saying she’d had “many” same-sex relationships by saying that she’s never actually slept with women. So that’s that. </p> \n<p>Tonight’s big premiere will help increase the already deafening buzz and we’ll be speaking personally to Haynes and the cast over the next few days, mainly to worship at their feet.</p> \n<h2>The call for gender equality</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e0ff691077dcccc0f0ce1268f4b22173c14b3c3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431792802387/8d46fe08-96da-46a3-9055-c2cae430b88a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Senior Advisor to Under Secretary-General UN Women Elizabeth Nyamayaro, actors Salma Hayek and Parker Posey, producers Elizabeth Karlsen and Christine Vachon, actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Variety Co-Editor-In-Chief Claudia Eller during the Variety and UN Women's panel discussion on gender equality.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Senior Advisor to Under Secretary-General UN Women Elizabeth Nyamayaro, actors Salma Hayek and Parker Posey, producers Elizabeth Karlsen and Christine Vachon, actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Variety Co-Editor-In-Chief Claudia Eller during the Variety and UN Women’s panel discussion on gender equality.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images for Variety</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yesterday, Catherine Shoard attended <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/17/salma-hayek-aishwarya-rai-and-parker-posey-hit-back-at-gender-inequality\">a forum on gender equality</a> where a variety of names, from politics and film, discussed institutional sexism in Hollywood. Salma Hayek claimed that “cinema undermines women’s intelligence” and criticised the “incredible ignorance” of the industry. She spoke about the power a male actor has over the casting process, recalling one instance where she was “kicked out” because the leading man didn’t approve of her.</p> \n<p>Parker Posey lamented the decline of the respected romcom as she thought she had “a career playing the best friend”. She also claimed that “movies are turning into games” and have become “ghoulish”.</p> \n<p>At the same time, there have been some big wins for female-fronted films at this year’s market. One of the hottest sales comes from Judd Apatow, whose next film as director is this summer’s Trainwreck with comedian Amy Schumer, who is producing Bad Moms, set to star his wife Leslie Mann. It’s sold quickly to a variety of territories. Another hot title is Three Generations, starring Naomi Watts, Elle Fanning and Susan Sarandon, which sold to the Weinsteins for $6m. Sisters Cannes do it for themselves or something.</p> \n<h2>The booing fallout</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"278ae2c6179bbd47a34fb5467abd05894ebff52f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431792522743/f059b49f-65c3-41eb-9007-406fb8f51646-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Matthew McConaughey at yesterday's photocall for Sea of Trees.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matthew McConaughey at yesterday’s photocall for Sea of Trees.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loic Venance/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As you may well remember from yesterday’s blog, we had our first boos of the festival at the end of Gus van Sant’s pretentious melodrama The Sea of Trees. It’s become the most universally ridiculed film of the festival (we’re still looking for a good review) and yesterday at the press conference, stars Matthew McConaughey and Naomi Watts faced the bloodthirsty press.</p> \n<p> “Anyone has as much right to boo as they do to ovate,” McConaughey said. While Watts remained positive about the film: “I’m happy to be here. I like the film. It was a happy day to hear that it had got in. It’s exciting to come support work that I got to do with these people. This is fun, this is dessert – no matter what. We’ve declared now; thanks for having us. We enjoyed it.”</p> \n<p>Director van Sant claimed he had read one review which had felt “comprehensive” and referred to the film as “its own animal”. It also seemed as if the tide had somewhat turned as last night’s premiere resulted in a two and half minute standing ovation. Still looking for that good review though...</p> \n<h2>The (lack of) screening etiquette</h2> \n<p>You’d assume that since we’re all (supposed) cinephiles here in Cannes, there would be a certain high(ish) standard of behaviour inside the screenings but sadly, it’s even worse than going to a Cineworld. Loud talking throughout, the distracting use of phones during key moments, aggressively OTT macho sneezing and the odd random shouting guy, such as at the end of this morning’s screening of relationship drama Mon Roi:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/trim_obey/statuses/599863129439379456\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Some nut started screaming abuse at the end of the MON ROI presser.

Yet aside from a memorably heady atmosphere, I found it rather underwhelming. His attempts to add something new to a tired formula ultimately ran dry.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/16/disorder-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-matthias-schoenaerts-thriller\">Disorder review - unsettling paranoid thriller descends into formula</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For his sophomore feature, he’s made a brave move up the rainbow with Green Room, a savage horror film that also takes a familiar subgenre but this time, he elevates it quite superbly.</p> \n<p>The premise is a riff on the hillbilly survival nightmare, typified by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Hills Have Eyes, where a group of youths find themselves at the mercy of a pack of backwoods brutalists. In Saulnier’s take, an underground, and overly proud of it, rock band (including Anton Yelchin and Arrested Development’s Alia Shawkat) books a gig at a neo-Nazi bar despite their initial reservations.</p> \n<p>The performance itself runs smoothly, with just a few bottles thrown and inflammatory names hurled. But as they prepare to leave, they stumble upon a dead body and are forced to barricade themselves in the green room while a line of thugs, led by Patrick Stewart, try to force their way in.</p> \n<p>Initially, it seems as if Saulnier is, yet again, disguising a derivative thriller as something else with his assured direction and Instagram-filtered style. But this is one of the rare horror films that actually improves as it goes. The familiar setup is lifted by a lack of punch-pulling (unlike many other contemporary horror films, there really are no rules) and Saulnier’s ability to take a well-trodden road and fill it with grisly surprises is quite something. The Cannes audience were gasping and recoiling at all the right moments.</p> \n<p>There’s also a thick vein of dark humour that runs through the film which never turns it into a comedy but keeps some of the nastier moments (and boy, are they nasty) from turning it into torture porn. While Yelchin, Shawkat and their bandmates, as well as a spunky turn from Imogen Poots as a girl trapped with them, are all standouts, the skinheads are often less impressive. Stewart’s accent is shaky at best while he fails to really convince as a grimy bigot. </p> \n<p>But the film wisely sticks with the good guys for the most part and escalates to a wonderfully gory finale. Given the rapturous response from the audience here at Cannes, I have a feeling that this one is going to be a late night horror favourite for years to come. I look forward to yellow.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431879872504/88b37bb1-295b-4630-9d08-9aa2688a3fd0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"“A savage horror film” ...

The throngs of ticket-hunters are getting ever denser outside the Palais; the weekend dog-walkers are out in force on the Croisette, their mutts ever tinier but the leads ever longer; and in a packed press conference room, Woody Allen is answering the now mandatory annual question about his globe-trotting habits. “When are you going to shoot in Rio, Woody?” asks a Brazilian journalist. (The year Woody Allen brings a favela movie to Cannes is the year I’ll decide to stay home.)</p> \n<p>The Cannes film festival is in session, for the 68th time – and yet, it won’t really be properly under way until either the critics have swooned en masse over some blue-chip masterpiece, or something really outrageous gets us all flustered – and since Lars von Trier is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/may/19/cannes-film-festival-2011-lars-von-trier-banned\">no longer welcome here</a>, we’ll have to rely on French scandalist Gaspar No&eacute; and his reputedly ultra-graphic 3D sex film <em>Love</em>, screening later this week.

That was certainly the keynote set by opening-night offering <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/13/la-tete-haute-review-catherine-denueve-cannes-2015\"><strong>La T&ecirc;te Haute</strong></a><em> </em>(Standing Tall), a very low-key, rather Loachian French film about a teenage boy and the juvenile justice system. OK, it does star the ever-regal <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/catherinedeneuve\">Catherine Deneuve</a>, but given recent razzle-dazzle first-nighters such as <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/the-great-gatsby\"><em>The Great Gatsby</em></a>, Emmanuelle Bercot’s film seems a little downbeat to be raising champagne flutes to: an affecting though unsurprising social drama with Deneuve as a firm but motherly judge watching over a troubled teenager, played by newcomer Rod Paradot. One can only assume this choice was the festival’s way of distancing itself from the snobbish, hollow glitz of last year’s reviled opener <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/grace-of-monaco\"><em>Grace of Monaco</em></a>.</p> \n<p>So far, little has provided huge excitement – although it was a thrill to see the hyper-frenetic, genuinely inspired <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/mad-max-fury-road\"><strong>Mad Max: Fury Road</strong></a>, which felt like the festival’s real curtain-raiser. We’ve had a couple of blasts of eccentricity in competition, but I wish I could have liked them better. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/matteo-garrone-tale-of-tales-glowing-reviews-cannes\"><strong>Tale of Tales</strong></a> is by Italian director Matteo Garrone, who made the intensely gritty Mafia film <em>Gomorrah</em>, but this English-language oddity is a quixotic misfire. Based on a 17th-century text, it features a mismatched international cast (Salma Hayek, John C Reilly, Vincent Cassel, Shirley Henderson) in a floridly baroque hotchpotch of stories about kings and queens, sea-beasts and spells – and a giant flea. A triumph of design and photography (it’s shot by Peter Suschitzky), it resembles a deluxe version of those cheap-and-cheerful East German children’s films, such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YAF3fWo8aoM\"><em>The Singing Ringing Tree</em></a> that livened up BBC teatimes in the 70s. Yet what genuine magic Garrone musters is drowned out by the creaking of the English dialogue. As bloated as the flea that becomes King Toby Jones’s beloved pet in the film’s jolliest episode, this oddball epic is a brave venture – but in the self-aware, revisionist post-<em>Shrek</em> era, you can’t help feeling this fairytale is a little, well, ogre-ist.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456642988__\n</div> \n<p>Odder still was <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/the-lobster\"><strong>The Lobster</strong></a>, the first English-language film by Yorgos Lanthimos, whose sublimely skewed <em>Dogtooth</em> spearheaded Greek cinema’s so-called <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/aug/27/attenberg-dogtooth-greece-cinema\">weird wave</a>. Now, there’s outre and there’s outre, but <em>The Lobster</em> feels too strenuously odd: it has WTF hand-stitched all over it in fine silk thread. It’s set in a hotel where single people must find a partner or turn into an animal. Another heteroclite cast (Colin Farrell, Rachel Weisz, L&eacute;a Seydoux, John C Reilly again) give alienatingly affectless readings of non-sequitur lines – it feels like an extended <em>Monty Python</em> sketch with Peter Greenaway dialogue. There is some genuine inspiration to Lanthimos’s violent social satire, but overall this feels less like a coherent film than a laboriously executed conceptual art piece. <em>The Lobster</em> is fatally bound in the carapace of its own surrealism. Still, you do get hear Olivia Colman singing Gene Pitney.</p> \n<p>So far, there’s one film I’d tip as a serious Palme d’Or contender, and that may prove the most challenging in the fest. Hungarian film <strong>Son of Saul</strong> is a Holocaust drama by first-time writer-director L&aacute;szl&oacute; Nemes, formerly assistant to maestro of super-slow austerity B&eacute;la Tarr. The film is as daunting as that suggests. It involves a prisoner in Auschwitz who thinks he recognises a dead boy as his son, and desperately searches for a rabbi to bury him. The taboo that once hovered over depicting Holocaust imagery in fiction films has been somewhat dispelled of late, for better or worse, by films such as <em>Schindler’s List</em> (better, arguably) and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/life-is-beautiful\"><em>Life Is Beautiful</em></a> (worse, much worse). But Nemes makes the singular decision to mount vast, detailed tableaux of the camp’s horrors, only to keep these images half-obscured and in the background, somewhere behind his protagonist (G&eacute;za R&ouml;hrig), whose haunted features fill the foreground for most of the time. The complex action, filmed in long takes, at once immerses us in events and keeps us at a distance, casting a disturbing slant on the story of a man who tries to make a profound symbolic gesture in the face of death, while seemingly blind to the slaughter going on all around him. It’s a terrifying, intellectually provocative work, audacious in its rethinking of Holocaust drama, and if it’s not the Palme, it certainly deserves to be seen and talked about widely.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"749396a2e49424404548baaece197395b5bfeb91\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431705878817/9ef57655-4dd0-430f-84a4-743a03af57d5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"La T&ecirc;te Haute \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Opener La T&ecirc;te Haute (Standing Tall): ‘A very low-key, rather Loachian French film about a teenage boy and the juvenile justice system’.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Of late, watching the latest Woody Allen has become one of those annual Cannes chores you steel yourself for, but you never quite get used to how joyless the experience can be. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/irrational-man\"><strong>Irrational Man</strong></a> is <em>Crime and Punishment </em>laboriously reimagined as a campus drama about a glamorously tormented academic (Joaquin Phoenix), who finds a new lease of life in planning a murder: “This is the meaningful act I’ve been searching for!” This is not Allen at his very worst, but it’s painfully mechanical. It feels like a bad student parody of Allen in his moral-philosophy mode, or like something he once would have sent up in one of his <em>New Yorker</em> squibs. Only Emma Stone’s ingenue vivacity survives uncrushed through lines like, “Despair is what Kierkegaard called ‘the sickness unto death’, Abe.” <em>Irrational Man</em> left me feeling if not sick unto death, at least – as Woody would once have said – a, a, a little nauseous.</p> \n<p>While British cinema is conspicuous here by its near-absence, a standout documentary this year is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/02/amy-asif-kapadia-documentary-amy-winehouse\"><strong>Amy</strong></a>, Asif Kapadia’s chronicle of the brief glory of Amy Winehouse. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/01/mitch-winehouse-interview-amy-documentary-film\">The singer’s family has objected to the film</a>, but whatever conclusions Kapadia might lead us to draw about her relationship with them, and with her self-consciously bad-boy ex Blake Fielder-Civil, the film eschews direct commentary to present a well-judged montage of clips showing Winehouse as a deeply characterful talent who simply wasn’t equipped for the temptations and traumas of sudden success. The tragedy of her fall is especially brought home by such material as an early <em>Friday Night With Jonathan Ross</em> appearance in which her joie de vivre and cheek fairly blaze out of the screen.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Arts/Arts_/Pictures/2015/5/15/1431705578215/Colin-Farrell-and-Rachel--010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Colin

The film is based on Patricia Highsmith’s 1952 novel The Price of Salt, about the love affair between a virginal shopgirl and the beautiful older married woman that she serves in the pre-Christmas rush in a Manhattan department-store: they are played here by Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett. Just occasionally, along with the classic echoes, Carol has the obsessive frisson of Nic Roeg’s Bad Timing and – with the flourishing of a revolver – Haynes conjures a fraught kind of Nabokovian despair and futile melodrama.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/13/cate-blanchett-reveals-her-many-past-relationships-with-women\">Cate Blanchett reveals 'many' past relationships with women</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is a creamily sensuous, richly observed piece of work, handsomely detailed and furnished: the clothes, the hair, the automobiles, the train carriages, the record players, the lipstick and the cigarettes are all superbly presented. The combination of all this is intoxicating in itself.</p> \n<p>Rooney Mara is Therese, unaffectedly pretty, ambitious but callow: self-deprecating and watchful in ways that make working in a department store congenial. She wants to be a photographer, and is saddled with a platonic fianc&eacute; Richard (Jake Lacy), with whom she has made vague plans to travel to Europe. Therese perpetually affects a silly beret with a kind of pompom and has a faintly dysfunctional fringe.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13893684fb3719cf1c5daf2fa75eb4fa3070544b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431808724857/48b7ef56-a950-4e80-9c50-a9a29e4cbb58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"CAROL Carol and Harge dancing. Carol....Film Still.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>When Cate Blanchett’s Carol first appears in the department store she is wearing furs: she is a predator, though a haughtily self-contained one. She has the air of a very dangerous animal that has just been hit with a tranquilliser dart. Accidentally on purpose, Carol leaves her gloves behind at the store, having chatted flirtatiously with Therese and ordered from her a train-set for her daughter, an item so big that it has to be delivered, which gives Carol an excuse to leave her address with Therese. And so their affair begins, in the traditional, bygone way of a long lunch in a restaurant booth with the food being accompanied with martinis.</p> \n<p>There is no arch knowingness or camp in the movie, except perhaps in one scene in which Carol has dressed the Christmas tree in the family home from which her husband and child are absent, and now sits with elaborate casualness on the floor, wrapping some extremely tasteful and expensive present, while the yet unseduced Therese picks out a tune on Carol’s piano. Soon, of course, they are to go on a trip together, staying demurely in adjoining motel cabins until one day they impulsively take the “presidential suite” and their intimacy advances.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a3d4bffda1164c7c68f6ed60b5519f27fb690e58\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431808940993/a17002a2-6b7a-4881-ab4d-ed6eb4370a52-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Carol film still\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>But Haynes shows that the point is that Therese has appeared in Carol’s life at a desperately dangerous moment. Her marriage with the possessive Harge (stolidly played by Kyle Chandler) is crumbling: he already resents her closeness to a former lover Abby (Sarah Paulson) – and of course boorishly hates himself for not having punished his errant wife more emphatically for this liaison – and is on the point of taking Carol’s infant daughter away from her in a custody battle. So it is not merely that Therese is to be Carol’s lover; she is to be a quasi-daughter, too.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/carol-film-cannes-karlsen-cate-blanchett\">Passion project: meet the indie super-producer behind Cannes hot ticket Carol</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This is such an outstandingly intelligent movie, which takes us within the narcotic clouds of depression and self-control with which Carol has managed her life: hers is a prototypical version of Betty Friedan’s Feminine Mystique, announced a decade after this. As for Therese, there is less enigma surrounding her, and the film is concerned to show us that there is no Ripley-esque parasitism in her attachment to the older woman. This is an affair of equals, or perhaps it is rather that Therese has a maturity which the showy, nervily insecure Carol does not have. It is a generational love, and a generational conflict between two women, one of whom does not have, or does not realise she has, the option of a professional career.</p> \n<p>Haynes’s drama shows the corsetry, and the mystery, and the way in which gay people could in fact in the 1950s negotiate their lives with dignity. I confess don’t love Carol as much as loved Far From Heaven, and perhaps it does not have that demonic flourish that came partly from pastiche. What the film certainly achieves is to suffuse everything with woozy eroticism and passion and defiance. I went into a trance watching it – and haven’t quite surfaced, even now.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431540418794/ccece4dd-38af-4984-8b0a-1f141e30d8b2-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Wilson Webb","altText":"Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett in Carol, directed by Todd Haynes.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Wilson Webb"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431808725280/48b7ef56-a950-4e80-9c50-a9a29e4cbb58-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"WILSON WEBB/PR","altText":"CAROL Carol and Harge dancing.

The dude didn’t approve me and I got kicked out.”</p> \n<p>But a positive note was sounded by Carol co-producer Elizabeth Karslen. She championed the likes of The Fault in Our Stars and The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel for subverting stereotypes and giving voice to oft-marginalised demographics.

If you want to take a whole generation of young girls to teach them about social history you can’t. Instead they can see a movie in which women have coke snorted off them. The censorship bodies need to think beyond the word ‘fuck’.”</p> \n<p>Yet for all the rallying cries, the conclusion seemed to be that the film industry had a long way to go before gender equality was in sight.

Last week the hallowed French film star <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/13/catherine-deneuve-social-media-has-stopped-people-dreaming-about-stars\">Catherine Deneuve</a> claimed it was not possible for modern audiences “to dream any more” about the stars on the screen. “Being a star entails glamour and secrecy,” she said in Cannes. “You have to keep something for yourself. You shouldn’t display everything of your private life. You see so many pictures, so many images – it’s hard to keep some degree of mystery.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4a33fcaa67dc172527eef8159bd67d9e133bb77f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431794103428/fcba94c6-faa0-468e-a581-0f133c7d628c-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Cate Blanchett caused a sensation at Cannes.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cate Blanchett caused a sensation at Cannes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cate Blanchett probably has some sympathy with Deneuve’s lament. Her new film Carol, a lesbian love story based on the 1952 Patricia Highsmith novel <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/books/dp/1469971879\">The Price of Salt</a>, has its premiere on Sunday night and the Oscar-winning actress, who stars alongside Rooney Mara, is due to make her appearance in front of the Palais du Festival with her co-star.</p> \n<p>According to the film’s director, Todd Haynes, having both actresses together on the red carpet for the launch is of “huge value” to his film – a difficult sell to wider audiences because of the lesbian theme. But for Blanchett the association with Carol may have already become uncomfortably close. In the runup to the festival, when Blanchett was asked if she had had same-sex relationships before, the married mother of four simply replied: “Yes, many times.” Cue a media feeding frenzy.</p> \n<p>But for one of the film’s producers, Briton Stephen Woolley, the focus on the stars is wholly positive. “Stars have always had enormous influence. People can be snobbish about them, but it is what we all love really. And Cate is fantastic because she makes indie films and big Hollywood productions. Having her here means that the film will reach a wider audience.”</p> \n<p>Deneuve identified the rise of social media as one of the prime reasons for the loss of mystique. For Gavin Smith, editor of New York’s Film Comment, the proliferation of stories, blogs, images and tweets is altering the equilibrium of the star system, but it still exists.</p> \n<p>“Some stars keep quiet and others, like James Franco, tweet a lot. Twitter and the internet have created a lot of micro-stars,” he said. “They are still there, though the constellation is more populous and some may not last as long. Careers are measured by the number of followers they have.”</p> \n<p>As the star debate swept the Croisette, festival director Thierry Fr&eacute;maux decreed an impromptu ban on “selfies”, arguing: “You never look as ugly as you do in a selfie.”</p> \n<p>Perhaps more than anywhere, Cannes thrives in direct relation to the amount of old world glamour it can summon up against the forces of the modern world.</p> \n<p>Luckily for Fr&eacute;maux, the public is still under Cannes’s spell, with tourists snapping themselves in front of the festival’s Palme d’Or logo and even taking screen grabs inside the cinemas. Even in the first few days of the festival, female Hollywood stars have shone on the red carpet as much, if not more, than they have on screen, making the most of their moment of self-promotion and glamour.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.hitfix.com/in-contention/review-emma-stone-does-her-best-to-bring-woody-allens-irrational-man-to-life\">Emma Stone, who has a lead role in Woody Allen’s new film Irrational Man</a>, and <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/film/festivals/the-lobster-review-colin-farrell-rachel-weisz-1201496633/\">Rachel Weisz, whose new film, <em>The Lobster</em></a>, also had its premiere on Friday, both knew how to play their press conferences. A touch of stylish reserve, coupled with a flash of wit – Stone teased Allen about his lack of guidance on the last scene of the film and Weisz teased her director, Yorgos Lanthimos, about the suggestion that his inspiration came from an episode of the sitcom <em>Friends</em>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d78f33ed2c9805486b0392af222fb531dbe13524\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431794249900/ec29e631-dffa-4f40-85d5-f3abb597393e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Catherine Deneuve and Roman Polanski at Cannes Film Festival in 1965.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Deneuve and Roman Polanski at Cannes Film Festival in 1965.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gamma-Rapho/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The glamour quotient on the Cannes jury this year is filled by British actress Sienna Miller. She has expressed her honour at getting the prestigious role, but her weight as a creative expert was undermined at a press conference when a fellow juror, musician Rokia Traor&eacute;, was described as “beautiful enough to be an actress”.</p> \n<p>Looks clearly remain a central part of the job description of a star at Cannes 2015, whether it is the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3081772/Miranda-Kerr-laps-attention-showcases-supermodel-figure-glitzy-black-skirt-ice-cream-launch-Cannes-Film-Festival.html\">model Miranda Kerr</a> launching a new ice-cream on the beach or Isabella Rossellini, star of independent foreign cinema, being brought up short by the huge image of her mother, Ingrid Bergman, on this year’s festival poster. “Yesterday, as I was walking up the red carpet, with Mama enormous, I got up to Thierry Fr&eacute;maux. I said ‘Thierry, I don’t miss her any more. Thirty years since she died, she’s so present. It’s wonderful,’” she said.</p> \n<p>Other screen idols are doing a clever job in avoiding the over-exposure of which Deneuve warns. A leading Hollywood producer spoke admiringly of the way Leonardo DiCaprio handles his image. “The thing is not to do too much in the public eye and Leo understands this. He keeps himself private and then suddenly he is everywhere when he needs to be,” he said.</p> \n<p>He didn’t think the selfie had changed things, but rather TV shows and websites devoted to unbuttoning the stars in public. Casting directors still need A-listers to open films: these are actors whom “the screen loves” and who have a professional approach to fame.</p> \n<p>With the timing of the premiere of The Lobster reportedly dictated by the availability of its French star, L&eacute;a Seydoux – shortly after Charlize Theron, in town for Mad Max, chose the Cannes red carpet to appear arm in arm with Sean Penn – both the personal and professional power of stardom is clearly in evidence. Pace Deneuve, reports of the death of the film star may have been exaggerated.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431793945605/aca65db9-2bf8-4afb-9bd6-67da19994d3a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Francois Durand/Getty Images","altText":"Emma Stone, Woody Allen and Parker Posey attend the Premiere of \"Irrational Man\" during the 68th annual Cannes Film Festival","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Francois Durand/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431794104798/fcba94c6-faa0-468e-a581-0f133c7d628c-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Cate Blanchett caused a sensation at Cannes.
