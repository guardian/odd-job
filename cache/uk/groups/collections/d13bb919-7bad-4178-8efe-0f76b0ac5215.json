There’s only a brief glimpse of a penguin this time around; here Jacquet returns to the Antarctic to tell the life story of climatologist Claude Lorius, now in his 80s, who has spent his life drilling out ice cores at enormous depth, and whose resulting analysis proved key in linking climate change and “greenhouse” gases.</p> \n<p>Jacquet presents his film very much as a head-on challenge to climate change deniers: by simply talking us through Lorius’ career, and the progress of his work, we understand the methodical processes by which he came to his conclusions. Essentially, it’s a rebuttal to background-noise deniers’ complaints about flawed science: Lorius says what he found, and what it means, with calm, unflappable detachment. We are taken through the stages: Lorius’ first trip to Antarctica to study snow; the realisation that the ratio of “light” hydrogen atoms to “heavy” in each snowflake corresponds precisely to the ambient temperature of the day of the snowfall; then decision to take core samples to study the change in temperature over time. Jacquet decribes a rather entertaining eureka moment: when ancient ice is used for a celebratory whisky, Lorius realised the trapped air that escapes can be analysed too, for its gas content. </p> \n<p>As the voiceover describe’s Lorius’ deep-drilling operations – first to 900m, extracting ice around 40,000 years old; and then with the help of engineers at a remote Soviet base, to 3600m and 400,000 years – the simplicity of Jacquet’s method begins to hit home: this amassing of data makes the emotional charge of the film unanswerable. It makes some of the filler footage – Lorius standing heroically on snowy mountaintops, or gazing nobly across the icepack as the camera circles him –look somewhat pointless. (Having said that, the tone of brooding, world-weary ennui that the voiceover adopts is somehow bracing; Lorius seems much more at ease in the world of ideas than the current crop of telegenic Anglo-American science types we are used to seeing in the media.) </p> \n<p>Nor does Jacquet mess about with anything like a sop to the deniers; there’s none of that undermining “balance” that a TV documentary would have to include. “The message is incontestable,” Lorius reports. Ice and the Sky acts as a kind of bookend, a retrenchment to the Al Gore eco-lecture An Inconvenient Truth: that film, released just over a decade ago, was aimed at people who were likely hearing about climate change for the first time. Jacquet’s film is a retrenchment, a call to arms to the environmental movement destabilised and buffeted by the denial industry. Ice and the Sky ends with a direct challenge to the viewer: “Now that you know, what are you going to do?” What, indeed. This is a powerful testament, and one that ought to have a considerable impact.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432372857704/d8c90a51-510b-4187-b6ed-8e9ad8399830-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Luc Jacquet’s documentary Ice and the Sky","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-23T12:59:43Z","lastModified":"2015-05-23T12:59:44Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":82,"contributors":[{"name":"Andrew Pulver","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/andrewpulver"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Cannes film festival","Festivals","Film","Culture","Documentary","Environment","Climate change","Antarctica","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/documentary","webTitle":"Documentary"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change"},{"id":"world/antarctica","webTitle":"Antarctica"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Andrew Pulver","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/andrewpulver"}}],"starRating":"4","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/23/ice-and-the-sky-review-powerful-cannes-2015-film","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/496py","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/23/ice-and-the-sky-review-powerful-cannes-2015-film","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/23/ice-and-the-sky-review-powerful-cannes-2015-film"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432372857704/d8c90a51-510b-4187-b6ed-8e9ad8399830-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Luc Jacquet’s documentary Ice and the Sky Photograph: PR","credit":"PR","altText":"Luc Jacquet’s documentary Ice and the Sky","cleanCaption":"Luc Jacquet’s documentary Ice and the Sky","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"Ice and the Sky review"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Michael Fassbender / Macbeth suffered from PTSD","rawTitle":"Macbeth suffered from PTSD","item":{"type":"article","id":"film/2015/may/23/michael-fassbender-macbeth-suffered-from-ptsd","title":"Michael Fassbender: 'Macbeth suffered from PTSD'","trailText":"The star of Justin Kurzel’s version of Shakespeare’s great tragedy tells the Cannes film festival that the warrior-turned-murderer’s treachery is the result of battle fatigue","standFirst":"<p>The star of Justin Kurzel’s version of Shakespeare’s great tragedy tells the Cannes film festival that the warrior-turned-murderer’s treachery is the result of battle fatigue</p>","byline":"Henry Barnes","body":"<p>The murderous treachery of Macbeth would today be diagnosed as the result of post-traumatic stress disorder, Michael Fassbender told the press at the Cannes film festival.</p> \n<p>The actor, who plays Shakespeare’s tragic warrior in a new film adaptation by Australian film-maker Justin Kurzel, said the director helped him realise it was the cumulative effect of months of grisly battle that drives Macbeth to murder his king after the war is over.</p> \n<p>“Never did it occur to me before this that this character was suffering from PTSD,” he said. “You have a solider who’s engaged in battle month-after-month, day-after-day.

In a subsequent battle scene Macbeth is shown hallucinating images of the witches that will deliver the prophesy that predicts his tyrannical path to power.</p> \n<p>“We know from soldiers today coming back from Iraq or Afghanistan that they have these hallucinations,” Fassbender said. “You could be walking down the Croisette here and then it’s Basra. All of a sudden it’s Basra”.</p> \n<p>Macbeth is Kurzel’s second feature after Snowtown, the director’s take on the Snowtown “bodies-in-barrels” murders, which were committed in Australia during the 1990s. His version of the Assassin’s Creed video game, for which he will re-team with Fassbender and Cotillard, is in pre-production. Kurzel said he was keen to avoid his version of Macbeth being lead by previous adaptations of Shakespeare’s text.</p> \n<p>“I was reading that a production of Macbeth is made every four years,” he said. “If that’s so it’s one of the biggest blockbusters out there”</p> \n<p>He said his version is less about the unchecked ambition of a ruthless husband and wife and more about a couples’ grief.</p> \n<p>“[It’s about] how you replace something you’ve lost,” he said. I’ve experienced that in my own life. I was very interested in how desparate you can be to fill a hole left by grief”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f17eed00-6d80-4da2-bfe0-e1174da3eb32\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432378867875/78050abf-4a1d-4c5b-b5f7-66d047fad494-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard in Macbeth.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard in Macbeth</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cotillard, the French Oscar-winner who’s in Cannes for a fourth consecutive year, said that she found playing Lady Macbeth in English with a Scottish accent difficult.

He tells Henry Barnes about slaying a sea monster, channeling his feminine side and making art that lasts </p>","byline":"Henry Barnes","body":"<p>In the course of a career spanning 26 years and 70-plus performances, John C Reilly has learned when to stand out and when to blend in. There he is tucked away at the back in What’s Eating Gilbert Grape? Here he comes heading up Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story and scene stealing in Boogie Nights and Magnolia. Today, in Cannes, it’s a stand-out day. Reilly arrives at the festival rocking a three-piece cream suit, matching fedora and a cane with a wooden duck’s head for a handle (“I’m fine. It’s for show.”). He works the carpet and dazzles the press. In person, he’s laidback and thoughtful. For the cameras, he’s a star. </p> \n<p>With a career as long and varied as Reilly’s, there are films you forget and films you shout about. He’s in Cannes supporting two – Tale of Tales and The Lobster – worth a holler. The latter, directed by Yorgos Lanthimos, is set in a near-future where being single is illegal. The lonely have 45 days to get themselves together before they’re turned into an animal of their choosing. Reilly plays the Lisping Man, sweetly yet awkwardly sidling up to other singletons in the hope of avoiding life as a parrot. He plays it clever, never letting his character’s nerviness become too wearing. As ever, you root for him. You want that perch left vacant.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff428c51d48b511f03d242722536650ae36c7c3d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432291203241/86307b33-cd8c-4cf5-b150-1d1d1dc58db9-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"John C Reilly in Yorgos Lanthimos's The Lobster, with Ben Whishaw and Colin Farrell.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John C Reilly in Yorgos Lanthimos’s The Lobster, with Ben Whishaw and Colin Farrell.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His Tales of Tales role is less meaty. Matteo Garrone’s film, based on a collection of stories by 16th-century Neapolitan scholar Giambattista Basile, is a lush and creepy fairytale portmanteau. It has Salma Hayek chowing on the heart of a sea monster and Toby Jones falling in love with a flea. Reilly plays Hayek’s husband, the king who retrieves her hideous snack. It’s a quickie role: you wish he’d been allowed to stick around longer. Still, he’s always been great at lending slight parts weight. He enjoys world-building, even for a character with a gnat-like half-life.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>When you improvise, it's like opening the tap: out comes what you're interested in or afraid of or obsessed with</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>“I used to play this game with my kids: give me an object and a place and a person,” he says. “I’d take these ideas from the air as they said them and pretend to eat them. And then I’d pretend to regurgitate – bleurgh! ‘Once upon a time ...’ A lot of times when you improvise like that, it’s just like opening the tap: out comes what you’re interested in or afraid of or obsessed with or attracted to. That’s the most profound thing you can say about fairy tales: they’re a manifestation of the human subconscious.”</p> \n<p>Reilly was born the fifth of six in a family with Irish and Scottish heritage. A stage actor from the age of eight, after theatre school he made his film debut in Brian De Palma’s Casualties of War, playing one of a group of Vietnam grunts accused of rape. His part got bumped up when De Palma recast after filming started. <a href=\"http://www.gamesradar.com/john-c-reilly-on-his-own-films/\">He’s said the experience reminds him that nothing in movies is set in stone</a>. So he’s kept adaptable – popping up in studio comedies (Step Brothers, vying for alpha man-child status with Will Ferrell) and arthouse totems (Terrence Malick’s The Thin Red Line). </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/15/the-lobster-review-cannes-film-festival-2015\">The Lobster review - dark satire on relationships gets fishy near the tail-end</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a musical skit at the 2007 Oscars, he told Jack Black and Ferrell how the comedians could gain respect from their peers. “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5JAPkvnyso\">You can have your cake and eat it too, just look at my career!</a>” he sings. “Mix it up and Oscar shall be yours.” Well, almost. He got a best supporting actor nomination for Chicago, where he plays a genial sadsack who falls to bits after he’s implicated in a murder. Oscar or no, Reilly’s consistently excellent at expressing disappointment on camera. His characters are always hoping for more before being dealt considerably less. <br /></p> \n<p>He’s never been big on heaping meaning on to his roles: “All of this armchair intellectualising really has nothing to do with an actor’s job.” He says he works on “basic human stuff”. His looks can switch from sourface to sweetie in a second. You realise pretty quickly if he doesn’t like a question, his eyes vanish behind an imposing slab of frown. Directors use this to pull a bait-and-switch on the audience. </p> \n<p>He’s superb in Boogie Nights because <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYzB_QqxXu4\">he gives porn star Reed Rothchild a guileless naivety</a>. In Magnolia, also written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g0JIohn0pfU\">he’s an LA cop, but he’s really a softie</a>, looking for love and fretting that losing his gun might drive a new girlfriend away. It was Boogie Nights and Magnolia that drew director Lynne Ramsay to Reilly. She cast him as a father blind to his son’s murderous impulses in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2011/oct/20/we-need-to-talk-about-kevin-review\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a>, her adaptation of Lionel Shriver’s bestseller (Reilly is godfather to her daughter).</p> \n<p>“He wanted to work with me at the same time that I was thinking I wanted to work with him,” says Ramsay. “So it was just serendipity that we got together. He’s a warm, funny guy – a natural comedian. But he’s got a dark side. He was playing a difficult part in my film. I was a real dorky part. In a way you wanted to hate him. But he really put himself out there.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d891556bacc08ca19f7c934ff2d362a5ea5c785\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432290382858/798223f8-e930-4430-b937-42e12f69ca1a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"John C Reilly with Salma Hayek in Matteo Garrone's Tale of Tales.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John C Reilly with Salma Hayek in Matteo Garrone’s Tale of Tales.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Tale of Tales, Garrone’s English language debut, spins stories of lusty kings, women obsessed with beauty and an ogre who’s idea of courtship is offering his beloved a human leg.

A couple of days after we meet, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/17/salma-hayek-aishwarya-rai-and-parker-posey-hit-back-at-gender-inequality\">Reilly’s co-star Salma Hayek will take part in a Variety panel on women in film-making</a>. She’ll argue that Hollywood is undermining women’s intelligence. “They don’t see us as a powerful economic force,” she said. “It’s incredible ignorance.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It's amazing that we haven't embraced the truth that women's movies make a ton of money</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Reilly agrees: “It’s amazing that we haven’t embraced the truth that womens’ movies make a ton of money. But it’s a dark view to say that the men in charge of Hollywood want only male stories and want to keep women down. That sounds too organised. It’s much more chaotic than that, much more market-driven.</p> \n<p>“At the core of everything that’s wrong with the world – everything that’s imbalanced and every conflict – is an inability to balance between male and female energy,” he says. “Extremist religions are based very much on supressing one gender and boosting another. I think if we could all recognise the fact that there’s male and female in all of us then there might be more balance in the world. More stories about women would be part of that.”</p> \n<p>His own male-female balance is “pretty 50:50”, he says. “I may look like this hulking Irish galoot, but I have a strong female side.” He calls himself a romantic and an appreciator of beauty, defining romanticism as “falling in love with things or people – appreciating the more poetic aspects of life and the beautiful essence of things”. What was the last beautiful thing he fell in love with? “L&eacute;a Seydoux.

He’s a character actor from a generation who thrived in a mid-budget ecosystem that’s declining.

With Dr Steve Brule</a>, a spoof guide to living from a damaged life coach. For films these days, he likes to look further afield – to Europe and directors like Lanthimos and Garrone – for parts that grab him. The goal is to plug into something that lasts.</p> \n<p>“I think there’s a lot of nothing out there,” he says. “There’s a lot of volume, but a lot of it’s nothing. It’s like we have a Snapchat consciousness. Stuff appears and you instantly forget it. I’m more interested in the stuff that stays with you.</p> \n<p>“Some things are eternal. Sometimes you hear a song one time and you immediately memorise the melody and it never leaves you. Why is that? There’s something alchemical about it.
