Women thrive in being many things. We can be just as dark and light as men. We’re more than just nurturers, more than just breeders, we’re just as conflicted. Not to brag, but I think women are better at embracing the dichotomy of the yin and the yang than men.”</p> \n<p>In Fury Road, Furiosa is a former sex slave, apparently driven into the wilderness after she proves infertile. Such women as can have healthy offspring become “high-prize objects – because to not have a fucking tumour on you is a fucking miracle. This is a world so poisoned it’s almost impossible to not have a child without disability. And that’s what’s so frightening,” she says. “At the end of the day, survival is about procreation. That’s our sustainability.

There is an argument that any such drama, however serious its moral intentions, risks looking obtuse or diminishing its subject, although this is not a charge that can be ultimately levelled at Son of Saul. </p> \n<p>By any standards, this would be an outstanding film, but for a debut it is really remarkable, a film with the power of Elem Klimov’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_and_See\">Come and See</a> — which has surely inspired the film’s final sequence — and perhaps also Lajos Koltai’s Hungarian film Fateless. It also has the severity of B&eacute;la Tarr, to whom director L&agrave;szl&ograve; Nemes was for two years an assistant, but notably without Tarr’s glacial pace: Nemes is clearly concerned at some level to exert the conventional sort of narrative grip which does not interest Tarr. </p> \n<p>Son of Saul is set in the Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp in 1944, and one Hungarian Jewish prisoner named Saul (played by Geza R&ouml;hrig) is a member of the <em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderkommando\">Sonderkommando</a></em>, a group of prisoners given humiliating and illusory privileges as trusties, with minor increases of food ration in return for the task of carrying the bodies from the gas chambers to pyres to be burnt and then carting the ashes away to be dumped: a task carried out at a frantic, ever-accelerating 24/7 rate, as the Allies close in. Among the dead, Saul discovers the body of his young son, and sets out to find a rabbi among the prisoners to give this boy a proper burial in secret: an objective requiring the deployment of pleas, threats, blackmail and the offerings of bribes using jewellery (called the “shiny”) stolen from the bodies. Saul’s desperate mission is carried out with the same urgent, hoarse whispers and mutterings as another plot in progress: a planned uprising, which Saul’s intentions may in fact upset. And all the time, the <em>Sonderkommando</em> are aware, through this network of whispers, that they themselves will be executed in due course by their Nazi captors.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fdec71f1a799e464bc4fabd1cf8019771daafaad\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431664530057/1fddd870-2103-4f49-bf89-9dd05710309c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Son of Saul.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nemes creates a film which focuses nearly all of the time on Saul’s agonised face, in a shallow focus, tracked through long, mostly unbroken takes, with the surrounding and background details often left blurred or indistinctly glimpsed: a muzzle-flash, a uniform, a naked body. Sometimes we see his back, with the red X marked on his jacket to indicate his status. His is a face from which all emotion appears to have been scorched away — it looks like the face of a pterodactyl. This, the film appears to be saying, is what the face of a survivor looks like, and indeed what the face of a non-survivor looks like: a dehumanised face. And yet Saul is to show another expression in the film’s final moments. In a way, this is how Nemes finesses the aesthetic or ethical question of how to create an individual drama within the horror, how to show and yet not show the horror itself: with this intense, constrained focus.</p> \n<p>One of the most devastating and deeply shocking aspects is that it begins with a gas chamber scene, the kind of scenario which another film might have wanted to end with, or in fact to finish just before showing, to approach in the same spirit of finally trying to stare into the sun. Son of Saul allows us to grasp only belatedly that this is what is happening — we glimpse it at the edge of the frame which is largely dominated by Saul’s face. Prisoners are stripped and herded as if part of an industrial process of evil: the Nazi officers are all the time tricking and pacifying them with nonsense about how they are to be fed, clothed and used as craftsmen. And the awful truth is the presence of the <em>Sonderkommando</em>, visibly employed helping to superintend this business, is also to hoodwink and reassure. It is a theatre of pure evil, all but unwatchable.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"781caf3a735ad6b09de36c4f23ce6b6608d0d56e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431664618007/b9dcfbcc-874a-49a0-8bcc-d23f5615f003-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Son of Saul.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/20/holocaust-film-restored-imperial-war-museum\">Holocaust documentary whose horrors remained unseen reaches cinemas – after 70 years</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Everything has to be hidden: in a way, the drama is hidden as well. Another reason for Nemes’s close-up procedure is that we, the audience, have to get in close to hear the conspiracy. A rare outburst comes when Saul confronts another prisoner at the lakeside where the ash is being disposed of: an exchange which results in an anguished attempt at suicide, a moment which finds its own heartstopping narrative echo in the last sequence. And it also results in a more familiar wartime-drama scene as a hatchet-faced SS officer, making sneering remarks about the elegance of the Hungarian language, attempts to interrogate the prisoners about what has just gone on: rather similar, in fact, to Ralph Fiennes’s icy character in Spielberg’s Schindler’s List. But Nemes calmly controls the juxtaposition of this traditional dialogue scene with the rest of the wordless inferno.</p> \n<p>Son of Saul appears at a moment when the debate about cinema and the Holocaust has been revived with the restoration of Sidney Bernstein’s all-but-lost explicit official documentary German Concentration Camps Factual Survey and Andre Singer’s Night Will Fall, the documentary about the way in which this film was conceived and then nervously suppressed after the war.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-446090147__\n</div> \n<p>Jean-Luc Godard believed that cinema’s essential failure was it failed to document the Holocaust in the hope of preventing it. In our time, Claude Lanzmann’s monumental Shoah is widely considered the most aesthetically successful approach because of the honesty and clarity of its testimony, which has no need of the (potentially facile) mechanisms of drama. Nemes’s film has found a way to create a fictional drama in all this, with a gaunt, fierce kind of courage — the kind of courage, perhaps, which it takes to watch.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431664491105/7b8119d2-4e02-4a5a-9ccb-be7e9bc73301-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Son

To become pregnant, the queen is told she must eat the heart of a sea monster that has been boiled and served by a virgin.</p> \n<p>“The heart tasted disgusting,” said Hayek. “He [Garrone] wanted it to look exactly like a real heart inside, so a doctor would recognise what I was eating. “It was [made of] pasta, candy – all kinds of disgusting things,” she said. “I was gagging.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3hVmpGzl7A\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/e3hVmpGzl7A?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Basile’s stories, written in the 1630s, influenced the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen.

He wrote archetypes that remain very topical.”</p> \n<p>Toby Jones, who critics suggest could be in the running for Cannes’s best actor prize for playing a king who transfers his affections from his teenage daughter to a flea, agreed that there were universal themes. “[There’s the] complexity of feeling that comes with a daughter growing up. The departure of a child, which is a reminder of ageing. The idea that ageing is often infantalising,” he said.</p> \n<p>Tale of Tales, which will premiere in Cannes on 14 May, has found a fairy godmother in the press at the festival.

While it’s important to see the shoo-ins, it’s also worth checking out the oddities. Cannes audiences are a vocal lot, known for booing films as varied as Terrence Malick’s divisive The Tree of Life and Quentin Tarantino’s Palme d’Or-winning Pulp Fiction, and we’ve already heard them loudly jeer, shout and leave dramatically.

It’s the new film from Japanese director Hirokazu Kore-eda and tells the story of the relationship between three adult sisters, with a surprising lack of conflict. It’s just been picked up for release in the US by Sony Pictures Classics, suggesting a possible breakout hit.</p> \n<p>This morning, Andrew Pulver enjoyed The Anarchists, a French police-infiltration thriller, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/cannes-2015-film-the-anarchists-review-tahar-rahim\">which he also gave four stars</a>, and called “vastly entertaining”.

The Coens confessed to having little interest in TV with Ethan saying he hasn’t watched it in decades, Guillermo del Toro joked that he was only allowed on the jury because he’d lost some weight while lolster Jake Gyllenhaal claimed he will watch all of the films with his eyes closed!

Vanity Fair, who usually plot an extravagant Cannes bash, has decided not to bother this year, Lionsgate, who has become known for its annual Hunger Games shindigs, has also stepped aside while tonight’s big Mad Max: Fury Road screening is being followed by “a dinner party” which, unless you happen to be sitting in-between Hardy and Theron, sounds not mad whatsoever.</p> \n<p>The big ticket is set to be Calvin Klein’s Women in Film party which always attracts the crowds and given the high caliber of female acting talent in attendance this year (Watts! Nyong’o! Blanchett! Moore!), expect it to be a big headline-grabber. But with just 200 names on the list, the intimate villa setting will be difficult to crash.</p> \n<h2>The selfie ban rule-breaker</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/01Distribution/statuses/598789142374391808\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"it\" dir=\"ltr\">Momento <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/selfie?src=hash\">#selfie</a> per <a href=\"https://twitter.com/salmahayek\">@salmahayek</a> dopo la <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/conferenzastampa?src=hash\">#conferenzastampa</a> di <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/IlRaccontoDeiRacconti?src=hash\">#IlRaccontoDeiRacconti</a> ed &egrave; subito <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/social?src=hash\">#social</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/TaleOfTales?src=hash\">#TaleOfTales</a> <a href=\"http://t.co/TeJZPZMjxW\">pic.twitter.com/TeJZPZMjxW</a></p>— 01Distribution (@01Distribution) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/01Distribution/status/598789142374391808\">May 14, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>Ever since festival head Thierry Fr&eacute;maux banned selfies on the red carpet, we’ve been waiting impatiently for a star to ignore said rule and let narcissism take over.

An Open Secret has been billed as the film “Hollywood doesn’t want you to see”, which might make it a tough sell for distributors. It’s a documentary about sexual abuse in the film industry and it made headlines today after cuts were made to remove references to certain Hollywood heavyweights. More on this one later in the festival.</p> \n<h2>The “wait, what?” film</h2> \n<p>As well as the more publicised side to Cannes, where hand-picked international films are screened, there’s also a somewhat murkier underbelly known as Le March&eacute; du Film. It’s the world’s biggest sales market for distributors to snap up films, which range from the buzzy (Whiplash director Damien Chazzelle’s musical La La Land) to the scuzzy (10 Days in a Madhouse: The Nellie Bly Story starring Christopher Lambert and Kelly Le Brock). </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f170295f9b92c997ac81501470ead56f839742c1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431524105907/87f23c2b-8399-4d65-a293-8cb6facfc5e1-331x420.jpeg\" alt=\"I Am Wrath, soon to be a thing.\" width=\"331\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I Am Wrath, soon to be a thing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Twitter</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Yesterday, we spotted a digitally overhauled John Travolta on the front of Variety for I Am Wrath, a Taken-aping thriller where he plays a man avenging his wife’s murder.
