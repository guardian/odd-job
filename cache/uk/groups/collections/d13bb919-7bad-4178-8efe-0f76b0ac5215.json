Portman, who was born in Israel and who lived there until she was three, before her family moved to the US, has taken a brave decision to take on such potentially contentious material – and while the resulting film is perhaps a tad on the conventional-looking side, it has an unusual, and possibly unique, perspective on Israeli psychology, and Portman demonstrates she possesses a confident grasp of film-making fundamentals.</p> \n<p>Oz, of course, is Israel’s most celebrated contemporary novelist, a humane, left-of-centre figure who is unswervingly devoted to upholding Zionism, and who went on to see combat in the six day war and the Yom Kippur war after the events of this film – which finish as he joins a kibbutz in his mid-teens – are over. He is made effectively the narrator of the film – though, rather disappointingly, doesn’t play the current, elderly version of himself – ruminating like a secular rabbi on linguistic derivations of modern Hebrew, his family’s state of mind, and the power of the Zionist dream. </p> \n<p>Portman’s film picks up the story in 1945: Oz is an eight-year-old boy, and his parents Arieh and Fania are nervously observing the increasing tensions between Jews and Arabs in Mandate Palestine. An early scene shows us Oz’s own preference for a two-state solution: little Amos is hauled by his uncle to a party at a friendly Palestinian neighbour, and precociously explains to the little Arab girl he meets in the back garden that “there is room for two peoples in this land”. However, an unfortunate accident to another, younger, kid shows the prickliness and paranoia that lies beneath the surface. </p> \n<p>When war comes, as it inevitably does, it is necessarily shown exclusively from the Jewish side: there is little room for doubt here that Arabs are the aggressors, and that Jewish nationhood after the brutalities of the pogroms and the Holocaust is the only way forward. That, certainly, is the mainstream Jewish view to this day; however, Oz’s implication that his mother’s foreboding and dread – even before the 1948 war gets under way, and in stark contrast to his father’s bullish espousal of nationalist sentiment – is a prefiguring of Israel’s future of violence, splintering mostand moral uncertainty: Faina herself uses the word “abyss”. The conclusion is underscored in the very final scenes, when a teenage Oz emerges from his kibbutz, astride a tractor, and to all appearances the hardened pioneer of his mother’s fantasies. But, says Oz, change is illusory, and “a fulfilled dream is a disappointed dream”. It’s a remarkably downbeat analysis of the Israeli project.</p> \n<p>Portman herself plays Fania: it’s a controlled, queenly performance, her intense glamour remaining entirely intact even during Fania’s most raddled moments. Homely, bespectacled Arieh (Gilad Kahana) and even glum little Amos (Amir Tessler) are inevitably overshadowed by Portman’s near-radioactive screen presence. But its on her achievement as a director that her role in this film will be judged, and it’s accurate to say she has done an impressive job, easily the equal of Angelina Jolie, who went similarly serious for her first feature, the Bosnian war drama In the Land of Blood and Honey.) Portman has made a film with something serious and interesting to say about Israel, a nuanced portrait of the place that demonstrates a commitment to, and connection with, her home country. This is an assured, heartfelt debut.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431700125388/80c33783-37db-4cc3-8c36-7fe8312bc385-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"A Tale of Love and Darkness film still","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-15T16:29:38Z","lastModified":"2015-05-15T17:17:15Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":192,"contributors":[{"name":"Andrew Pulver","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/andrewpulver"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Natalie Portman","Israel","Film","Culture","Cannes film festival","Film adaptations","Books","Festivals","Middle East and North Africa","World news","Autobiography and memoir"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/natalie-portman","webTitle":"Natalie Portman"},{"id":"world/israel","webTitle":"Israel"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"film/film-adaptations","webTitle":"Film adaptations"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"world/middleeast","webTitle":"Middle East and North Africa"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"books/autobiography-and-memoir","webTitle":"Autobiography and memoir"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Andrew Pulver","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/andrewpulver"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/15/cannes-2015-a-tale-of-love-and-darkness-review-natalie-portman-film-directing-debut","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49vmc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/15/cannes-2015-a-tale-of-love-and-darkness-review-natalie-portman-film-directing-debut","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/cannes-2015-a-tale-of-love-and-darkness-review-natalie-portman-film-directing-debut"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431700125388/80c33783-37db-4cc3-8c36-7fe8312bc385-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A Tale of Love and Darkness film still.

He may have permanently deserted the more challenging and rigorous style of movies like the Palme D’Or-winning Elephant, Last Days or indeed his poetically mysterious Gerry, about two guys lost in the wilderness. This fantastically annoying and dishonest tear-jerker is almost like a parodic version of that movie. (It is incidentally possible that Van Sant and screenwriter Chris Sparling were inspired by Naomi Kawase’s contemplative film The Mourning Forest, in the Cannes competition in 2007.) <br />For all its apparent sombreness and thoughtfulness, The Sea Of Trees is an exasperatingly shallow film on an important and agonisingly painful subject - depression and suicide. This it slathers in palliative sentimentality. The gooey musical score with strings and woodwind, kicking in from the first airport scene, unmistakably signals brimming-eyed self-pity and self-forgiveness.</p> \n<p>Matthew McConaughey, whose performance strains every sinew, plays Arthur, an academic mathematician (he wears glasses). He is travelling to Aokigahara, or The Sea Of Trees, a vast woodland wilderness at the foot of Mount Fuji in Japan which has become notorious as a place where people come to take their own lives. Once there, Arthur has clearly reached a terrible decision. But then he sees another pilgrim of despair: Takumi (Ken Watanabe), a Japanese businessman in a rumpled suit, staggering into the clearing, covered with blood from wounds on his wrists, having evidently botched a suicide and perhaps now changed his mind. Arthur comes to help, and the two men begin a kind of friendship as they try to find a way out of the forest. Conveniently, Takumi speaks excellent English, which is neither remarked upon nor explained.</p> \n<p>As the relationship develops, the film discloses its annoying and insidious anti-scientific and anti-rational theme - as well as its fantastic condescension to the Japanese character. Like some wise old forest sprite, Takumi pours scorn on Arthur’s attempt to understand his situation from his standpoint as a professional scientist. Naturally Arthur comes to accept the spiritual immaturity of this view. <br />Like Arthur’s wife Joan (Naomi Watts) - their troubled marriage is revealed in flashback - Takumi is entirely subordinate to Arthur’s dull emotional journey. But he doesn’t get any flashbacks of his own. There are some cursory lines about some disgrace and demotion in the office and casual remarks on how Arthur “doesn’t understand” suicide in Japanese culture. (Really? I’d have liked to see this glib stereotype scrutinised a little further.) But that’s it: Takumi’s pain and his story is second-class. </p> \n<p>Naomi Watts does her best with the role of Arthur’s wife: and the film almost looks something from actual life when the two have petty marital arguments. But then a dark shadow falls on them - redemptive and love-renewing in the way these situations are supposed to be - but the finale to this situation made me want to scream at how evasive and fatuous it is. </p> \n<p>It is Van Sant’s depiction of the forest itself which is at the centre of the problem. It is a hostile place from a straightforward view of survival: Arthur is always falling heavily down rocky slopes and getting deluged by floods, and yet McConaughey’s supposed physical pain never seems to be any sort of plausibly interesting dramatic problem. We see the dead bodies of suicides there, revealed so casually that it is at first unclear if these are hallucinations - but the film can’t decide if they should make us scared or sad. So we are neither: they are represented blankly, like the forest itself, and like the film, they are inert. </p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431686766223/558ea101-a736-4fb9-87d6-d77de1d7a027-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Matthew McConaughey and Ken Watanabe in Sea of Trees.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-15T19:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-05-16T06:04:05Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":40,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Bradshaw","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterbradshaw"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Culture","Film","Matthew McConaughey","Gus van Sant","Cannes film festival","Drama"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"film/matthew-mcconaughey","webTitle":"Matthew McConaughey"},{"id":"film/gus-van-sant","webTitle":"Gus van Sant"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Bradshaw","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterbradshaw"}}],"starRating":"1","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/10/the-sea-of-trees-review-gus-van-sant-matthew-mcconaughey","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49vkk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/jun/10/the-sea-of-trees-review-gus-van-sant-matthew-mcconaughey","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/10/the-sea-of-trees-review-gus-van-sant-matthew-mcconaughey"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431686766223/558ea101-a736-4fb9-87d6-d77de1d7a027-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Exasperatingly shallow ...

They have not spilled blood or been involved in any sort of killing. They were inducted on arrival under the threat of death. They had no control of their destinies. They were as victimised as any other prisoners at in Auschwitz.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/15/son-of-saul-review-an-outstanding-excoriating-look-at-evil-in-auchwitz\">Son of Saul review: an outstanding, excoriating look at evil in Auschwitz</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>R&ouml;hrig conceded that such confusion did persist, with even Primo Levi having insisted that the Sonderkommando were in some sense collaborators. “Of the 20 or so who are still alive many didn’t reveal their work even to their families after the war because they were regarded so negatively. But in 2015, no one should call them part-killer.”</p> \n<p>The film, which has attracted a raft of five-star reviews, is also the debut of its 38-year-old director, L&aacute;szl&oacute; Nemes. Set as the Allies approach in October 1944, it unfolds over a day and a half as the prisoners plot a rebellion and Saul comes across the body of a young man to whom he wishes to give a proper burial. Its vivid, handheld shooting style, which gives the horrors of the Holocaust a new immediacy, can be regarded as an attempt to honour the dead in appropriate fashion, as its protagonist does.</p> \n<p>Nemes and his co-writer drew inspiration from the testimony of such prisoners written at the time, but said they wanted to avoid “the stuff of books”. “We didn’t want to stand back from the situation, to establish a historical distance. We can’t put post-war emotions on it. We didn’t want to make a beautiful film full of icons, or for it to be emotional in the conventional sense. Because after several months, these men are empty of conventional emotions.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d302131f-5c69-4a6f-b210-87904b8439f2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431709204008/87fda090-f726-4238-9f38-b5d0bd550e70-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Son of Saul\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Though many audience members have confessed to finding the film a troubling watch, graphic content is largely kept blurred in the margins of the screen; the camera’s focus remains on its leading man’s face. Likewise the audio mix tones down the terrors. </p> \n<p>“A really realistic sound would have heard nothing but people crying because they were dying,” said Nemes. “We tried to be very restrained. Cinema seems more and more keen on giving more and more. I think less is more and the right way was to rely on the imagination of viewers to reconstruct something that cannot be reconstructed. For them to create in the mind the experience of the extermination camp.”</p> \n<p>The film is the only Hungarian title in competition. The producers had hoped it would be a co-production but funding bodies in France and Israel turned it down on account of the subject matter’s “riskiness”. </p> \n<p>It is expected that the film, which tackles a time in history Jean-Luc Godard famously felt cinema had failed to properly address, will go home with a prominent prize next Sunday evening. Nemes’s direction has taken the lion’s share of praise, but many are also tipping R&ouml;hrig, whose traumatised detachment fills almost every frame. </p> \n<p> “The expectation was for me to dance in a very small area in a very minimalist way,” he said. “Usually you are able to shine and create moments. Not here.” The actor also said the experience of the shoot had triggered a personal crisis of faith. “As a person who believes in God, I had an experience making this that was very struggling and hard.”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431709054818/f61053b9-779b-4905-a950-e5d38a17b5b9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"TRISTAN FEWINGS / POOL/EPA","altText":"Geza Rohrig and, left, the director of Son of Saul, at the film's press conference.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: TRISTAN FEWINGS / POOL/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431706234543/7a0c4b38-c770-436c-981e-e45fc280492d-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Son of Saul"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-15T17:03:49Z","lastModified":"2015-05-15T17:45:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":262,"contributors":[{"name":"Catherine Shoard","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733735285/CatherineShoard.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/catherineshoard"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Cannes film festival","Film","Culture","Holocaust","Festivals","Second world war"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"world/holocaust","webTitle":"Holocaust"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"world/secondworldwar","webTitle":"Second world war"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Catherine Shoard","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/catherineshoard"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/15/son-of-sauls-astonishing-recreation-of-auschwitz-renews-holocaust-debate","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49x2a","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/15/son-of-sauls-astonishing-recreation-of-auschwitz-renews-holocaust-debate","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/15/son-of-sauls-astonishing-recreation-of-auschwitz-renews-holocaust-debate"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431709054818/f61053b9-779b-4905-a950-e5d38a17b5b9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Geza Rohrig and, left, László Nemes, the director of Son of Saul, at the film’s press conference.
