It starts by resembling a classic studio picture from Hollywood, the sort of thing George Stevens or Douglas Sirk might have made, or perhaps something like Mu Fei’s Chinese classic Spring In A Small Town. Then it morphs into a futurist essay on China’s global diaspora and its dark destiny of emotional and cultural alienation. In this movie, the boundaries are getting pushed, visibly, between the opening and closing credits. The pure work-in-progress energy of all this is exhilarating, and if the resulting movie is flawed in its final act, then this is a flaw born of Jia’s heroic refusal to be content making the same sort of movie, and his insistence on trying to do something new with cinema and with storytelling. </p> \n<p>His movie is split into three parts, taking place in 1999, in 2014 and in 2025. We begin with a bunch of people dancing to the Pet Shop Boys’ Go West, and as the new century and millennium dawns, the movie shows China more or less obsessed with doing that: going West, embracing capitalism while at the same retaining the monolithic state structures of the past, and beginning to worship consumer goods as status symbols: stereos, cars, and perhaps most importantly mobile phones — a technology which the film shows retaining its fetishistic power for the next quarter-century.</p> \n<p>Jia’s longtime collaborator and wife Zhao Tao gives a superb performance as Tao, a young woman who is dating a coal-miner Liang (Liang Jingdong). But Tao is also being courted by the impossibly conceited Jingsheng (Zhang Yi), one of China’s new breed of pushy entrepreneurs who actually buys the coalmine, forces Liang out of the picture, and marries Tao. They later have a child that Jingsheng in a grotesquely celebratory mood insists on naming “Dollar”, so great is his belief in the child symbolising a prosperous quasi-Western future. Meanwhile, the devastated Liang moves away but later in 2014, they are all to meet again and later in 2025, when Dollar is a twentysomething college dropout in Australia, his life appears to have absorbed a genetic destiny of alienation and pain.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f07946e5a79691e711085fcf51b07c85c07ef9b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432095160207/b6a9b6d7-1abe-4537-a74c-b8945d44a415-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mountains May Depart.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mountains May Depart.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Zhao Tao begins the movie as a girlish, ingenuous soul: always bouncing happily around, treating both her suitors with a kind of frank, sisterly affection while she internally ponders the question of love and marriage. When this becomes a more insistent reality, she appears to grow up emotionally on camera: deeply affected by how wounded Liang is by his romantic defeat. She becomes a beautiful, but melancholy woman in the light of her own marital disaster, and then her sadness assumes a tragic dimension in the wretchedness she experiences after her beloved father dies, and sees how her own son has been encouraged by her ex-husband to think of her feelings and her family as irrelevant. And finally all this is reconfigured in Jia’s almost sci-fi sketch of the future, incarnated in the form of Dollar who appears to have forgotten his mother and his mother country. But he experiences the return of the repressed.</p> \n<p>It is extraordinary to think how Jia Zhang-ke’s film-making has changed since his early, more opaque movies like Platform (2000) or Unknown Pleasures (2002). Now the performances he is getting are far more emotionally demonstrative. This is not a violent movie like A Touch of Sin (2013), his satirical adventure in Tarantinoesque pulp: but it has a shockingly violent moment when someone gets punched in the face. Yet it also has a bewilderingly surreal moment when Tao witnesses a light aircraft crashing next the road down which she is walking, yet without reacting or calling for help. Did she dream it? Did Tao, in fact, dream the movie’s entire final Australian section? Jia allows us, fleetingly, to suspect this. </p> \n<p>That final coda does not entirely work: inevitably, some of the dreamed-up technological innovations and stylings look self-conscious and the sheer weirdness means that the emotional power of ordinary life is no longer available. And yet without this unexpected leap into the future, the movie would not have the savour that it has. And what a wonderful performance from Zhao Tao.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432095094494/11a24b4e-fe0a-4680-b121-07720361a23c-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":342,"width":570,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Mountains May Depart.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432095160909/7befa4de-a5f3-4046-815f-7ecb71a2197c-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":351,"width":585,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mountains May Depart.","credit":"PR","altText":"Mountains May Depart.","cleanCaption":"Mountains May Depart."}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T04:15:34Z","lastModified":"2015-05-20T04:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Bradshaw","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterbradshaw"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cannes 2015","Cannes film festival","World cinema","China","Film","Culture","Festivals"],"tags":[{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"film/world-cinema","webTitle":"World cinema"},{"id":"world/china","webTitle":"China"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Bradshaw","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterbradshaw"}}],"starRating":"4","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/mountains-may-depart-review-jia-zhang-ke-scales-new-heights-with-futurist-drama","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/493m2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/20/mountains-may-depart-review-jia-zhang-ke-scales-new-heights-with-futurist-drama","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/mountains-may-depart-review-jia-zhang-ke-scales-new-heights-with-futurist-drama"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432095094494/11a24b4e-fe0a-4680-b121-07720361a23c-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":342,"width":570,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The pure work-in-progress energy is exhilarating’ … Mountains May Depart","credit":"PR","altText":"Mountains May Depart.","cleanCaption":"‘The pure work-in-progress energy is exhilarating’ … Mountains May Depart"}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Mountains May Depart"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Red carpet lessons / Rebellious flats, grown-up party frocks and Lupita Nyong’o’s mojo","rawTitle":"Rebellious flats, grown-up party frocks and Lupita Nyong’o’s mojo","item":{"type":"article","id":"fashion/2015/may/19/cannes-2015-red-carpet-lupita-nyongo-charlize-theron-julianne-moore-emma-stone-poppy-delevingne","title":"Rebellious flats, grown-up party frocks and Lupita Nyong’o’s mojo: six things we learned from the Cannes 2015 red carpet","trailText":"The film festival’s red carpet taught us all about Charlize Theron-approved gladiator chic, Julianne Moore’s new Hollywood glamour, grown-up party frocks courtesy of Emma Stone, and Poppy Delevingne’s Glastonbury-worthy gothic romance","standFirst":"The film festival’s red carpet taught us all about Charlize Theron-approved gladiator chic, Julianne Moore’s new Hollywood glamour, grown-up party frocks courtesy of Emma Stone, and Poppy Delevingne’s Glastonbury-worthy gothic romance","byline":"Jess Cartner-Morley","body":"<h2><strong>1.

Some red-carpet rules are meant to be broken</strong></h2> \n<p>First, Croisettiquette declared that selfies were banned on the red carpet. At that point, we were sort of on board, because selfies are a bit naff, even though it is a bit snooty and French and annoying of them to make a fussy old law about it. But then, on Saturday night, female guests were denied entry to the premiere of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/16/carol-review-cate-blanchett-captivates-in-woozily-obsessive-lesbian-romance\" title=\"\">Carol, starring Cate Blanchett</a>, because they were in flats. Festival organiser Thierry Fr&eacute;maux <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes\" title=\"\">has denied</a> that there is a Cannes ban on flats. Good news, Monsieur Fr&eacute;maux, because if there was, it would be (a) idiotic (b) wildly out of touch, in a season when exquisite flat shoes are a catwalk-approved chic eveningwear option and (c ) so clearly not What Cate Would Do. Last year, <a href=\"http://tomandlorenzo.com/2014/06/cate-blanchett-in-chloe-at-the-women-in-film-2014-crystal-lucy-awards/\" title=\"\">Blanchett wore flat gold sandals with a ruffled, floor-length Chlo&eacute; white gown on the Women in Film red carpet</a>, and looked awesome. So, postmodern caveat to these red-carpet fashion lessons: sometimes the red carpet gets it wrong.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8b18193c3ab7a4f0f228ae083bf3664671c7ec47\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432046670563/db230c84-dd55-4eac-acc4-5c6e35eb91f0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Valentino flat ballet shoe.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Valentino flat ballet shoe.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valentino</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3. Romance is dead (but floorlength is hot)</strong></h2> \n<p>Happy news! Old Hollywood Glamour – undoubtedly the dullest, most spirit-crushingly regressive fashion trope of the modern era – is in retreat. Observers believe there is hope that within a few years it can be safely contained within the confines of the Academy Awards machine, dominating the Oscar red carpet year after boring year but without contaminating the wider world. Every red carpet has its brand, and the Venus-rising-out-of-organza-froth aesthetic, where every floorlength dress comes with an extra three feet of fabric at the hem, is what the Oscars does best. Cannes went for a more dynamic look: see Julianne Moore in crimson velvet-and-croc Givenchy, or Natalie Portman in crisp-cut, sharp-bodiced Dior. Both were full-length, but decidedly not ethereal. There is something pleasing about seeing a dress at a premiere that might give the wearer a small chance of being able to sit in a cinema seat, rather than one which makes it clear she is heading straight from the red carpet back to her hotel room.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1ba87f016ded34ad15328769122696db751b961a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432045699816/ae08167c-1fd6-43dc-8354-e47924f2df59-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Julianne Moore at the Max Max: Fury Road premiere at the Cannes film festival 2015.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julianne Moore at the Max Max: Fury Road premiere at the Cannes film festival 2015.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AGF s.r.l./REX Shutterstock/AGF s.r.l./REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>4. Grown-up party frocks exist!</strong></h2> \n<p>If every red carpet has its brand, then the Oscars is, as discussed, Trad Glam. The Met Gala – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2015/may/05/the-met-ball-2015-six-style-talking-points\" title=\"\">the one where Beyonc&eacute; and Kim basically showed up nude</a> – is Minimum Fabric, Maximum Publicity. Youth-orientated music events such as the Billboards are Clothes You Can Only Wear When You Are Nineteen. (See: Rousteing and his Balmaination, as above.) Cannes, one of the oldest red carpet occasions of them all, has, as a result, found itself squeezed. This used to be where licentious dressing happened – from Bardot hoiking up her sundress to splash in the waves, to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2010/may/02/the-10-best-cannes-moments\" title=\"\">Madonna in Jean Paul Gaultier couture-lingerie in 1991</a> - but it’s really, really hard to compete with Beyonc&eacute;’s naked arse, so Cannes has had to find a new angle. Happily for us, it is gravitating towards thinking-woman’s-party-dress territory. For instance, this week saw two fabulous long-sleeved party dresses. These are really useful, in actual real life, but to observe the US red carpets you would think it was illegal for anyone under 60 to cover their arms. Emma Stone in Oscar de la Renta (long black lace sleeves, mid-thigh hemline) and Rooney Mara in white Alexander McQueen were among the week’s best looks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af64b5c0c2d192f378587255879cfd12d584b604\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432045870085/53893094-3ae5-46fa-9668-c8a7588e976c-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Emma Stone at the Irrational Man photocall at the Cannes film festival 2015.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Stone at the Irrational Man photocall at the Cannes film festival 2015.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Harvey/FilmMagic,</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>5. Your Glastonbury look is sorted: something a bit gothic and braids in your hair</strong></h2> \n<p>Gothic romance is having a moment. For evidence, look no further than the twin fairy-queens of boho, Sienna Miller and Poppy Delevingne, who both went dark and twisted-fairytale at Cannes. Miller, who was a juror this year, didn’t put a foot wrong sartorially, with a Cannes wardrobe that served as an unequivocal full stop at the end of one of 2015’s key fashion messages: Sienna Miller Is Totally a Thing Again. Her most directional look was for the Carol premiere, in black with a white lace collar, and a crown of braids. Poppy Delevingne moved on from her signature Chelsea-garden-party vibe to a more severe, darkly embellished Burberry dress, worn with a dramatic necklace and the same plaited hair. The look is a bit rebellious, faintly white-witch, and will totally work with wellies and a pint of cider. Job done.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb4d96f8932a2acaa67fdb7813c70da23312eb3e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432046026292/272161e8-b5fa-4fb8-a5ea-2651f1db6fce-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Sienna Miller at the Carol premiere at the Cannes film festival 2015.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sienna Miller at the Carol premiere at the Cannes film festival 2015.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Venturelli/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>6. Nyong’o has found her mojo</strong></h2> \n<p>When you find a look that works for you: work it. That’s what Lupita Nyong’o has figured out. Her emerald-green Gucci gown, with knife-pleats cinched in a simple high waistband and deeply-plunging neckline <em>(top)</em>, was a standout of this year’s Cannes red carpet. It was also remarkably similar to the pale blue Prada gown (with knife-pleats cinched in a simple high waistband and deeply plunging neckline) <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/gallery/2014/mar/03/oscars-2014-red-carpet-fashion-in-pictures\" title=\"\">she wore to the Oscars in 2014</a>.

The cruelty exhibited there exists today against the Kurds and elsewhere. You have a feeling of insecurity about tomorrow. There’s a level of chaos because global powers do not agree on the most minimal consensus.”</p> \n<p>R&ouml;hrig is the star of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/15/son-of-saul-review-an-outstanding-excoriating-look-at-evil-in-auchwitz\" title=\"\">Son of Saul</a>, a tense, almost unbearable thriller set in Auschwitz in 1944 among the Sonderkommando – prisoners given a stay of execution to work in the gas chambers. It’s so frank and unflinching, it makes even the finest of previous Holocaust films look crass. “With movies like <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/schindler-s-list\" title=\"\">Schindler’s List</a>, you have an evil guy and you have a good guy,” says R&ouml;hrig. “There’s no such thing. We are all evil and good inside.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>One of the lessons of 1944 lies with the bystanders – we can't just let things happen</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Contemporary resonance, though unintentional, is unavoidable. This is a film about whether one participates in the suffering of others. “I gave up thinking that society is anything other than an abstraction long ago. You have different societies in every country. But whichever group you belong to, you’re never exempt from taking a side when it comes to crimes against humanity. That’s true in Syria and America and Israel and everywhere. Every day, we all have to make a case-by-case evaluation: is this an important enough demonstration to go on? Is this where I should send my money? Is this a petition I should sign? I do not believe in living in an apolitical ivory tower. One of the lessons of 1944 lies with the bystanders – we can’t just let things happen.”</p> \n<p>Just in case it’s not yet evident, R&ouml;hrig is not your average starlet. Son of Saul is his first movie, but at 48 he’s gentle, intense, heavily bearded and unswayed by the glitz. More than that: he’s allergic to it. Such escapism as the entertainment industry offers he holds partly responsible for exactly this apathy. “Consumer society targets your senses and threatens thinking entirely. ‘Why aren’t you laughing? There is so much fun! Why don’t you try this cake or that Coke?’” So Cannes can be hard to stomach? “No question. There is a certain level of shallowness – emptiness even – that is really painful.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/15/son-of-saul-review-an-outstanding-excoriating-look-at-evil-in-auchwitz\">Son of Saul review: an outstanding, excoriating look at evil in Auschwitz</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>R&ouml;hrig was born in Hungary; his father died when he was four and after some years in an orphanage he was adopted, aged 12, by Jewish friends of the family. In high school he spent half a year in Paris, “growing up, so to speak, on the breasts of the enlightenment”, before being expelled at 16 for anti-communist activity and founding an underground punk band, Huckrebelly, which played under different names to dodge the cops. He studied Polish literature then film direction, lived in Jerusalem before moving to Manhattan in 2000 to study at the Jewish Theology Seminary. He now teaches, writes poetry and is working on his first novel, Dead Bread. Five months ago, his wife gave birth to twins. He mostly looks at his phone, he says with a smile, to check they’ve eaten.</p> \n<p>R&ouml;hrig’s face fills almost every frame of Son of Saul. The director, L&aacute;szl&oacute; Nemes, says he was drawn to the actor because “his facial features and his body are always changing. It is impossible to tell his age, for he is at once old and young, but also handsome and ugly, ordinary and remarkable, deep and impassive, quick-witted and slow. He moves, is given to fidgeting, but knows how to keep silent and still.”</p> \n<p>Today, in a windowless, heavily mirrored, incongruously orgiastic hotel bar, R&ouml;hrig keeps still, save for the odd impassioned tap of the table. He’s unlike any other actor I’ve met but, at a push, one could liken him to an especially bookish <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/mark-ruffalo\" title=\"\">Mark Ruffalo</a>, bearish machismo leavened by slight, nearly reedy voice. In the film, his face is almost calcified, drained of emotion as he goes about his work – herding the new arrivals into the gas chambers, scrubbing down the walls and floors afterwards, stacking the bodies, putting them into the incinerators, shovelling their ashes into a river.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8febebf997ff556ea768dfb41ea57934ad3dfcf6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432049066016/f7b9930a-0f65-4361-8776-dbe01e60c757-460x350.jpeg\" alt=\"G&eacute;za R&ouml;hrig, left, in Son of Saul, directed by L&aacute;szl&oacute; Nemes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">G&eacute;za R&ouml;hrig, left, in Son of Saul, directed by L&aacute;szl&oacute; Nemes.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the film’s press conference, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/15/son-of-sauls-astonishing-recreation-of-auschwitz-renews-holocaust-debate\" title=\"\">R&ouml;hrig reacted with anger</a> to one reporter’s suggestion the Sonderkommando were “half-victims, half-hangmen”. Anyone who read their testimonies could not, he says, have “the slightest doubt that the Sonderkommando were not just equally victimised but more victimised. They lived in the epicentre of hell. I think they deserve utmost respect. Some of them tried to make their way into the gas chambers instead.” That “sophisticated journalists” betray such prejudice came as only a mild surprise – the Sonderkommando have long been the victims of such ignorance. “Partly because everything about them was hearsay. The rules of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/feb/06/why-obsessed-nazis-third-reich\" title=\"\">Nazis</a> meant they couldn’t meet with the rest of the inmates, so they were somewhat mysterious. And the victims had so much anger and frustration, they projected it on to them.”</p> \n<p>Such displaced blame may also stem from the logic that if one accepts the Sonderkommando’s guiltlessness on grounds of compulsion, one must also exonerate some Nazis. But R&ouml;hrig rejects this, drawing a distinction between the prisoners’ work and, say, “pouring crystals of Zyklon B into a fully crowded gas chamber. I would reserve the right to morally question such action. It is clearly problematic to murder even one person, let alone hundreds, simply because you’re commanded to do so.”</p> \n<p>But he does admit wrestling with one aspect of the Sonderkommando’s duties: “To fool the Jews that they’re taking a shower. That is the only question I think has some legitimacy.” Yet, he thinks, to have done otherwise, prompting panic and a bloodbath, would have been as cruel and fruitless as a doctor explaining to a terminally ill patient that a period of euphoria often precedes death. “So I think this lie is justified, as bad as it is. It’s graceful. I don’t think they were obligated to tell the newcomers that in the next half-hour, they’d be gassed to death with their children and parents. For the rest of their functions – moving the dead, burning them, taking their ashes, cutting their hair, searching their dead bodies for jewellery and golden teeth – I see absolutely nothing I think is unethical. It was the only way for them to do their best to survive.”</p> \n<p>R&ouml;hrig’s relationship with God began before he was aware of religion. He would speak to someone who “for a while, I thought was my father. And then I realised it wasn’t him. I just needed someone to talk to. I think there is a side of us that we can’t share even with the ones we love, and that side has to be aired. It has to be communicated. So I talk to somebody. And I call that somebody God.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It wasn't God who rounded up the Jews, Gypsies, Soviet PoWs, gays and midgets and slaughtered them. The human family did</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>His faith was then forged on a trip to Auschwitz. Making a movie set there inevitably tested it. “But it wasn’t God who rounded up the Jews and the Gypsies and the Soviet PoWs and the gays and the perfectly German mental patients and the perfectly German midgets and slaughtered them. We did it. The human family did it. I do not for one nanosecond like to pretend that God is off the hook. He could and should have stopped it at a much earlier stage. But I would not be able to get up from my bed in the morning, let alone pray, if I didn’t fully believe that God somehow was there holding the hands of each and every Jew in the gas chamber – each and every Tutsi, Armenian, Kurd, Israeli, Palestinian who suffers unjustly.”</p> \n<p>It isn’t the right of survivors to say God was not present, he thinks, given that those who died are not available for testimony. “So I think there is room for me to believe, as irrational as it sounds, that since God is all-capable, in some mysterious way, he suffered along and was there. If I wasn’t able to believe this, I don’t know why I’d take my next breath.”</p> \n<p>Atheism he can respect: his elder son has taken a stand against faith, he says. “And trust me, I did my best to raise him to be some sort of believer.” It’s agnostics with whom he struggles. “We are not living in the same reality. I can’t imagine a more pressing question. Life is so threateningly fragile. I just can’t take their attitude seriously. They bore me.”</p> \n<p>Has he ever had proof for his faith? Never. And he wouldn’t want it. That, he says, would force him into a corner and rescind his free will. “I always like to have the option to say no. It’s like love. One day, you go out with a girl and you feel like she’s the one for you.” To prove such love by cutting off a finger is impossible. Yet millions would go much further in the name of a deity. “Faith can never be blind,” he says. “Only idolatry can.” So those millions “are not religious in my vocabulary. They are cult followers.”</p> \n<p>Son of Saul is an extraordinary caution against idol worship. And its leading man’s rare consciousness of such fundamentalism informs the whole film. “I do idol worship sometimes,” he says. “But as soon as I realise, I smash my idols into a thousand pieces.”</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432048853007/Geza-Rohrig-star-of-Son-o-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Géza Röhrig meets the press at Cannes: 'There is a level of shallowness that is painful.'

You already know about his son, now let’s hear about his daughter. This new film from Belgian director Jaco van Dormael (Toto the Hero, Mr Nobody) won’t exactly win favour with the ultra-faithful, but for those who like their Bible stories with a thick coat of satire, The Brand New Testament is a peppy, original and (importantly) very sweet story.</p> \n<p>It begins in the centre of the universe: a dingy flat in Brussels. God spends his day intentionally making people miserable, tapping out rules on his his outdated DOS computer and fiddling with his train set. He giggles as he makes sure the toast always falls jam-side down, or that whatever queue you are on will be the slowest. His wife (simply called the Goddess) is sweet and simple, focusing on embroidery and her baseball card collection. But 10-year-old daughter Ea (played by a fantastic young actress, Pili Groyne) is observant, gaining in powers and wants to change things. “Don’t get crazy ideas like your brother,” Dad grunts, but later that evening she has a conversation with “JC” and the pair devise a plan. Ea is going to get six additional disciples, and listen to them, thus creating a Brand New Testament.</p> \n<p>Before she can do this, she must free the world from their need for her bum of a father. Sneaking into his office, she sends a text message to everyone in the world, detailing precisely how much time they have left until they die. At first people think it is a hoax, but when the 30-minute crowd all start dropping dead (and always in funny ways), they realise it’s for real.</p> \n<p>For some, the news changes nothing, but others radically change their lives. One guy with decades left to live becomes a daredevil, jumping off buildings but always surviving due to increasingly silly saves. Another person decides to spend his remaining years building the Titanic out of matchsticks. Most people decide that they have no interest in God.</p> \n<p>Ea then speaks to her six randomly chosen people and listens to their gospels. Some are silly (like Catherine Deneuve’s, which includes her taking a gorilla from a zoo to her bed); others are touching, such as that of a sickly 10-year-old boy who wants to live out the rest of his days as a girl. There’s also an angry dude who always wanted to shoot at people, and now uses the reasonable logic that if he hits them, it was meant to be.</p> \n<p>As Ea gathers her new disciples and the world begins adjusting to a new social order, things ultimately become rather pleasant. A scene at “death beach” where people go to say goodbye to loved ones is more of a celebration than anything else. (A celebration with dark humour: an old man in a suit and tie is seen checking his watch as if he’s annoyed by the wait.)</p> \n<p>God tries to follow Ea down to the streets and finds that he’s completely incapable of taking care of himself. Not to spoil the movie, but it’s too funny not to mention that he ultimately ends up deported “back to Uzbekistan”. Significantly, one of the kindest characters in the film (other than a homeless St Peter fill-in who knows how to retrieve fish burgers from a fast-food dumpster) is a member of the clergy. The specifics of his faith are not discussed, but his moral compass remains undamaged.</p> \n<p>What’s best is that through it all Van Dormael maintains a blazing storytelling momentum and a highly creative visual scheme. He’s in the Gondry/Gilliam zone, but if you can’t get down with a floating fish skeleton humming <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fztkUuunI7g\">La Mer</a>, why do you go to the movies in the first place?</p> \n<p>Everyone on Earth is ultimately doomed, but this is a vision of optimism, of people being given the opportunity to help one another and doing it with tenderness. If you can get past the initial blasphemy, you’ll find a highly moral film.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432053084895/Catherine-Deneuve-invites-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Catherine

drug-war thriller Sicario, starring Emily Blunt, Benicio del Toro and Josh Brolin, revealed that they had been under pressure to rewrite the lead role, a female FBI agent played by Blunt, as a man.</p> \n<p>Speaking to journalists at the Cannes film festival after the press screening of Sicario, which is competing for the Palme d’Or, the film’s director Denis Villeneuve confirmed that screenwriter Taylor Sheridan had been asked, before he came aboard the project, to change the gender of the lead role. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p>

from film screening for not wearing high heels</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“The screenplay was written some years ago,” Villeneuve said, “and people were afraid that the lead part was a female character, and I know several times [Taylor Sheridan] had been asked to rewrite the role. When I got involved, the script was as it is, and I embraced it, as did [producers] Black Label and Thunder Road. But the pressure came before, and these guys had the guts to keep it as it was.”</p> \n<p>Sicario follows a US team drawn from a number of agencies as it responds to gruesome killings in the borderlands between the US and Mexico, resulting from the increasing leakage of Mexican cartels’ activities north of the border. Blunt’s character, Kate Macy, initially is part of a team raiding a house owned by the cartel in Arizona, but is then attached to a group operating over the Mexican border in Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez, location of even more appalling acts of “narco-terror”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-d3897c16-cf15-4f5c-abd5-e008e14095f4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432038410055/ae423d91-f25a-4412-b188-e087784abcf3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"In sight of the action ...

The FBI are actually incredibly efficient, it was good to see the restraints of being in that job.”</p> \n<p>It was also pointed out that Blunt’s character is the only female character of any substance, and has no dialogue with any other women in the film, meaning it would comprehensively flunk the Bechdel test. Blunt implied that Macy’s experience as an female agent is analogous to women’s experience in the film industry – “she is trying to survive in a predominately male-driven profession” – but said she felt uncomfortable with the idea that Macy was simply a “tough female” role. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4e1865af03dc081c544738b5170dc15332f88b89\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432038271082/da3568bf-7b01-403d-affd-bc660a48a324-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Benicio Del Toro, Emily Blunt, and director Denis Villeneuve at the press conference for Sicario.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benicio Del Toro, Emily Blunt, and director Denis Villeneuve at the press conference for Sicario.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CLEMENS BILAN / POOL/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“I get asked to do a lot of these roles, but I don’t see them as ‘tough’. You can’t compartmentalise strong women like that, they are far more complex. This character is damaged and troubled, struggling with the morally questionable things she experiences.</p> \n<p>“The FBI agents I spoke to are just normal girls: they go home and watch Downton Abbey, you definitely would want to have a beer with them. I found it interesting to get under the skin of being a female cop: what it costs you, how it affects your marriage, how you cope with the men working alongside you.”</p> \n<p>At the same press conference, Blunt also spoke of her disdain for the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes\">apparent ban on women wearing flat-heeled shoes for the film festival’s black-tie events</a>, saying it was “very disappointing”.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431934524963/c71fc347-2558-44f9-a4fe-8cf30d40c56e-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Emily Blunt in Sicario","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432032223361/8e9b5fd9-e6e3-4671-b181-56da2c170d27-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"In sight of the action ...
