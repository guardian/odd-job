There are brilliant flourishes here that could only have come from Sorrentino: superb swooping camera moves, grotesque faces and angular perspectives, and it always watchable. But it’s beset with Sorrentino’s occasional fanboy weakness for pop-star cameos — Paloma Faith appears here, playing herself and not earning her keep. Youth has a wan eloquence and elegance, though freighted with sentimentality and a strangely unearned and uninteresting macho-geriatric regret for lost time, lost film projects, lost love and all those beautiful women that you never got to sleep with. The title has literary resonances with Conrad and Tolstoy, but the youth evoked is mostly that of young women and young women’s bodies, whose allure never fades for men as they get older.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/19/the-brand-new-testament-review-cannes-film-festival-2015\">The Brand New Testament review – God's not dead, just useless, in a sweet and blasphemous satire</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is all incarnated in Michael Caine, whose face here is an inscrutable mask of worldly disillusion, breaking occasionally into a droll smile: he plays retired British composer Fred Ballinger, currently fending off requests from the Palace to conduct a special Royal Command performance of his early masterpiece Simple Songs. (Fred is supposed to have been an intimate of Stravinsky’s — but this music sounds more like Britten pastiche.) He is undergoing a health check-up at this luxurious state-of-the-art sanatorium, although as he says: “At my age, getting in shape is a waste of time.”</p> \n<p>Fred is there with his best buddy Mick (Harvey Keitel) an ageing movie director, here with his production team, brainstorming a new film set to star his old diva friend, played by Jane Fonda. Mick’s son is married to Fred’s daughter and assistant Leda (Rachel Weisz) who actually shares her dad’s bedroom. There is also an LA movie actor Boyle (Paul Dano), another sufferer from that popular condition: self-congratulatory cynicism, who is preparing for a certain historical role, and astonishes everyone at the spa by appearing one morning in full costume and makeup. The two old guys, Mick and Fred, go into a kind of arthouse version of Statler and Waldorf, and they stroll around the grounds, grumping away, torturing themselves by whingeing about their prostate worries and perving over the current Miss Universe (Madalina Diana Ghenea) who has won a stay here as part of her prize and turns out to be smarter than anyone thought.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5f3h6vr5BdQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5f3h6vr5BdQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There has already been much comment online to the effect that Caine is playing the kind of role that might otherwise have gone to Sorrentino’s longtime collaborator Toni Servillo, and it’s true that Caine’s air of sticken ennui does remind you of Servillo. But actually Caine is very good in the role, he brings something different, a distant fatherly charm.</p> \n<p>If only the film was not so (mostly) marooned in that single location. When the action cuts to memories and fantasies of Venice, where Fred conducted an orchestra, the film suddenly comes alive with power and movement: there is a stunning tableau of St Mark’s Square underwater. Even a very quick scene with Jane Fonda losing her temper on a plane frees things up a bit: but mostly we are drifting around the handsome facilities and grounds of this sumptuous but weirdly soulless open prison with its massages and its heated pools.</p> \n<p>There is a poetic richness in Youth which occasionally emerges as Mick and Fred talk about what they can remember of their lives, and Mick’s realisation that there are huge stretches of his own life that he can simply no longer remember: his own youth is more or less a complete blank. It is an idea which is more terrifying than piquant: more disturbing, arguably, than anything Mastroianni’s director faced in 8 &frac12; — though he himself had youth more or less on his side.</p> \n<p>Sorrentino has a basic level of fluency and verve. Anything that this film-maker places in front of his camera is always arresting to some extent: there is a superb shot in which Fred and Mick spy on an elderly couple having sex in a forest: a shot replete with comedy, absurdity and alienation. I am already looking forward to another more substantial Sorrentino film, though there is pathos here, and sweetness. </p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432117182775/2b61a65b-76ad-4da5-8c84-2172e0b23b05-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel in Youth","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-20T10:45:49Z","lastModified":"2015-05-20T23:00:38Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":36,"contributors":[{"name":"Peter Bradshaw","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733746410/PeterBradshaw.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/peterbradshaw"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Youth","Cannes 2015","Paolo Sorrentino","Michael Caine","Rachel Weisz","Film","Culture","Cannes film festival","Drama","Festivals"],"tags":[{"id":"film/youth","webTitle":"Youth"},{"id":"film/cannes-2015","webTitle":"Cannes 2015"},{"id":"film/paolo-sorrentino","webTitle":"Paolo Sorrentino"},{"id":"film/michael-caine","webTitle":"Michael Caine"},{"id":"film/rachel-weisz","webTitle":"Rachel Weisz"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/cannesfilmfestival","webTitle":"Cannes film festival"},{"id":"film/drama","webTitle":"Drama"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Peter Bradshaw","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/peterbradshaw"}}],"starRating":"3","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/494xv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432117182775/2b61a65b-76ad-4da5-8c84-2172e0b23b05-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘He has a wan eloquence and elegance” ...

John Lasseter, chief creative officer of Disney, which bought Pixar in 2006, presented details of new films including The Good Dinosaur, Zootopia and Moana to journalists at the Cannes film festival today. Lasseter, in Cannes with <a href=\"http://movies.disney.com/inside-out/\">Inside Out</a>, about four emotions who control a young girl on the cusp of puberty, reconfirmed his company’s commitment to making films that appeal to all ages. “Parents, kids, millennials, college students. As long as you’re living, you’re an audience member,” he said.</p> \n<p>First to lumber out of the gate at the two-hour presentation was Pixar’s The Good Dinosaur, which Lasseter said “tackled the greatest ‘What if?’ of all time: What if the asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs actually missed earth?”<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/18/inside-out-review-cannes-film-festival-pixar\">Inside Out review - a buoyant and sweet-natured comedy from Pixar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The answer was perhaps not as outlandish as you’d hope. The Good Dinosaur is about Arlo, a knobbly-kneed Apatosaurus who is separated from his family after the tragic death of his dad. Thanks to that cosmic near-miss, he’s able to bump into Spot, a prehistoric human who has also lost his family and acts like a dog. “It’s a boy and his dog story,” Lasseter said. “But the roles are reversed.” Arlo and Spot share their grief, come of age, grow to love their imperfections etc, etc on their journey home. It all looks a little rote: The Lion King wandering in The Land Before Time. After delays that lead to Pixar <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/nov/25/pixar-lays-off-workers-good-dinosaur\">jettisoning 5% of their workforce</a> in 2013, The Good Dinosaur will finally be out in the US on 25 November.<br /></p> \n<p>Disney prospect Zootopia, co-directed by Byron Howard (<a href=\"http://www.disney.co.uk/bolt/\">Bolt</a>, <a href=\"http://www.disney.co.uk/tangled/\">Tangled</a>), Rich Moore (<a href=\"http://www.disney.co.uk/wreck-it-ralph/index.jsp\">Wreck-It Ralph</a>) and Jared Bush, seems more lively. The trailer, voiced by Jason Bateman, introduces us to an Earth where humans never happened (“so the world is modern and civilised”) and animals are anthropomorphic (“a big, fancy word meaning they stand up straight”).</p> \n<p>Animals wear clothes and follow human routines. They flick through the Wall Street Gerbil or Entertainment Squeekly while they take their wildly different sizes of subway car to work. Natural enemies live side by side, and ingrained prejudice is rife. Judy (Ginnifer Goodwin) is the first bunny to join the Zootopolis police force. The old hands – buffaloes, elephants and rhinos – think she’s too fluffy for the job, so she gets consigned to traffic duty. Judy’s determined to break down the stereotypes about what a species should be, so when a twist of fate gifts her a missing persons case, she sets out, with a wily fox called Nick (Bateman), to prove the doubters wrong.<br /></p> \n<p>The clips Lasseter showed suggested Zootopia’s script’s a zinger, full of allusions to grownup left-field cop dramas (LA Confidential, Inherent Vice) and packed with sight gags – the population counter on the sign welcoming visitors to The Burrows, the suburb where the rabbits live, is automated and ticks steadily upward.<br /></p> \n<p>Another scene, still unfinished, showed Judy and Nick entering a club where animals have rejected clothes and decided to return to a “natural” way of life. “This is Disney animation’s first nude scene,” said Lasseter as Judy prudishly picked her way through the cavorting pigs, giraffes and bison. “It’s been a long time coming.”<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1cbf1f71a0ded7853011e44669144ee8be086ed\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432133901155/78100ef6-283e-4a5d-8a9a-1ee32fd70a05-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gargantuan success … Frozen.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gargantuan success … Frozen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Confidence at Disney is at an all-time high after the gargantuan success of <a href=\"http://frozen.disney.co.uk/\">Frozen</a>, said Lasseter. “It was quite broken when we came in,” he said, referring to his arrival at the studio 10 years ago, after a period in which his predecessor, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/26/business/media/26eisner.html\">Michael Eisner, had clashed with shareholders and Roy E Disney</a>, Walt’s nephew. “Morale was really low,” said Lasseter, who detailed how he had restored the faith in his creative team by “changing the model from executive-driven to creative-driven”.<br /></p> \n<p>Last among the original new properties was Moana, a Mulan-style musical jaunt from Disney, inspired by a studio trip to the South Pacific. It’s titular character is a Polynesian princess who defies her father’s wishes by setting out on a boat to find a new island for her tribe. Moana teams up with the demigod Maui, a cute pig called Pua and a cranky rooster called Hei Hei to take on a wicked island spirit. Lasseter screened a clip showing “the ocean as a character”. A young Moana chased after a shell that was spinning in the surf. The ocean drew back and allowed her to walk into a tunnel of water, revealing fish and a giant turtle. The ocean teased and tickled Moana, changing her hair style with a splash, before sending her back to land on a coconut husk. It was a cute scene, visually remarkable thanks to Disney’s work on animating fluid dynamics, but the prospect of the film as a whole felt a bit wet.<br /></p> \n<p>Also in the works (and the water) is Finding Dory, the sequel to Pixar’s 2003 hit <a href=\"http://www.disney.co.uk/finding-nemo/\">Finding Nemo</a>. Ellen DeGeneres will return as the forgetful surgeon fish, who, after a treasured memory suddenly floats into her head, is convinced she must set out to find her parents, played by Eugene Levy and Diane Keaton.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ffe901bd296ca08b147aa0657a01b45c1457b12\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432133766733/b145595e-a5e4-404b-b2f0-9f3273bb6fbc-460x449.jpeg\" alt=\"Woody and Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story, directed by John Lasseter.\" width=\"460\" height=\"449\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Twenty years ago … Woody and Buzz Lightyear in Toy Story, directed by John Lasseter.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Disney Pixar/Sportsphoto/Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Directed by <a href=\"http://www.disney.co.uk/wall-e/\">Wall-E</a>’s Andrew Stanton, Finding Dory will feature new characters, including Destiny (“a whale-shark who thinks she’s a whale, but she’s a shark,” Lasseter said), a “ridiculously cute” unnamed sea otter and Hank, a grumpy octopus. Lasseter described animating an octopus as a challenge and detailed how the Pixar team had been testing out the animals’ abilities for inspiration. “They can get out of anything,” he said. “The only thing that stops an octopus is astro-turf.”<br /></p> \n<p>Finally, Toy Story 4 got a brief mention. Lasseter confirmed that the latest in the franchise, about toys that come to life when humans are absent, will be a brand new chapter, not a continuation of the previous storyline. Lasseter had little extra to share on the new film, but did remark that it’s 20 years since the original <a href=\"http://toystory.disney.com/\">Toy Story</a> revolutionised the animation industry by becoming the first feature-length CGI animation. He said he was amazed that time had passed so quickly.

The latest in the controversy over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/19/cannes-backlash-high-heels-emily-blunt-flat-shoes\">whether or not women have been turned away from premieres for wearing flat shoes</a> rather than high heels is an official (confusing) response from the festival’s press office:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“Regarding the dress code for the red carpet screenings, rules have not changed throughout the years (Tuxedo, formal dress for Gala screenings) and there is no specific mention about the height of the women’s heels as well as for men’s. Thus, in order to make sure that this rule is respected, the festival’s hosts and hostesses were reminded of it.” </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Last night saw the premiere of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/19/sicario-review-emily-blunt-thriller\">Sicario</a>, which was the first red carpet event since the story first broke. Despite a press conference earlier in the way that saw star Emily Blunt say that women “shouldn’t wear high heels”, she ended up avoiding flats and, sadly, director Denis Villeneuve’s comment that he would attend wearing heels with actors Josh Brolin and Benicio del Toro didn’t come to fruition. Shame. </p> \n<h2>The shock doc</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dffa30e8c22d9fab9a484b9f583b7719a6b4782e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432116012179/230e2238-a02b-461f-98d1-9e6859a6c777-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The poster for An Open Secret.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The poster for An Open Secret.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Despite not showing as part of the official festival, last night’s screening of Amy Berg’s documentary <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/an-open-secret-review-damning-documentary-takes-aim-at-sexual-abuse-in-hollywood\">An Open Secret</a> (for press but also potential buyers) has helped to make it one of the buzziest films of the town. It’s a shocking look at sexual abuse in Hollywood that names and shames some industry figures who took advantage of young actors. It’s had a troubled time getting to the screen, given its inflammatory content, and some cuts have been made for legal reasons but it’s finally set to get a wider audience this summer. Its release in the UK might prove troublesome however. The producers claim the organisers of the London film festival told them that British tabloid law prevented them from showing it.

The most likely is a best supporting actor nomination for Benicio del Toro while Roger Deakins might well get a cinematography nod. Emily Blunt is also in with an outside for best actress.</li> \n <li><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/20/youth-review-cannes-film-festival-2015-michael-caine\">Youth</a> - although it’s proving divisive, some believe that it will be a hit with Oscar voters and that Michael Caine could be in for a best actor nomination</li> \n <li>Son of Saul - universally glowing reviews for this gripping Holocaust drama should also help push it to a best foreign language nom</li> \n <li><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/18/inside-out-review-cannes-film-festival-pixar\">Inside Out</a> - Pixar’s latest should definitely get a nomination for best animated feature</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>The cinephile’s dream</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-94d99a7b-156a-4cc3-8e4c-071ddbec6379\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432110994883/2008251c-f2d1-4e6c-a756-53129e5a2c13-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hitchcock/Truffaut.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hitchcock/Truffaut.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One of the most anticipated documentaries of the festival, at least for the fervent film buffs, has been Kent Jones’s revealing look at Fran&ccedil;ois Truffaut’s interview series with Alfred Hitchcock.

A group of managers, agents, publicists and directors would manipulate youthful ambition to their advantage, associating sexual activity with career progression. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1JpHUaMBARU\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/1JpHUaMBARU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>What Berg does is bravely hand over the details to the audience, naming the accusers without reticence. What the complainants do, with even more courage, is refuse to hide behind pixels or fake names, sharing their difficult stories on camera. It’s shocking and inflammatory stuff, revealing a grim network of abuse, centering on interconnected industry names who would host parties where drugs and alcohol would be used to get what they wanted.</p> \n<p>What’s even more disturbing than the acts described is the aftermath. The long-term damage to the boys who grew up with addictions and/or psychological difficulties is devastating and in one particular case, life threatening. The film also details the surprisingly muted effects on the paedophiles in question. Both the legal system and film industry have failed to protect these boys and punish the predators who molested them. There seems to be a strange legal and industry apathy towards such crimes, and it’s this that the film hopes to change.</p> \n<p>In Hollywood, convicted and registered sex offenders are still allowed to work with children and, chillingly, the film reveals that some of the men named in the film are still doing so. As an important call for change within the industry, it’s hugely effective. As a documentary, it’s often a bit rough around the edges with a few questionable choices (including a rather sappy song at the end, and a set of interviewees so wide that it often gets confusing).</p> \n<p>But it’s still an important piece of journalism, and as it states at the beginning, all profits are being given to a foundation set up to ensure stricter regulations in film, so the focus always remains on the greater good. Given the film’s incendiary content, especially in its final stretch (the textual update on what has since happened, or rather, not happened, to the men in the film is enough of an indictment), expect to hear more on the film and its effects on the industry over the coming months.
