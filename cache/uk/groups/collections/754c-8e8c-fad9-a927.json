It’s as if you can’t mention him. I’m the one everybody wants to pretend never lived. But that will not be the case for ever because it can’t be the case forever. That won’t work, people aren’t stupid. I mean, I tried to make it right with every one of those people … I can only do so much.”</p> \n<p>Asked about the federal court case pending against him, Armstrong told his interviewers: “The whistleblower case is a $100m case. We would not be sitting at this table any more. We wouldn’t be sitting in this home any more. We wouldn’t be sitting in any home. I don’t have $100m.</p> \n<p>He added, though, that he “likes” his case. “In a whistleblower case you have to show real tangible harm. The Postal Service commissioned studies in 2004 that showed it made $100m. There were years when it was making upwards of $20m a year in new business, before we had even started to race. So when you start to add all these things up, here is the question: ‘Where are the damages?’”</p> \n<p>He insisted he will tell all. “Certainly in my depositions and hearings in the trial for the federal case, at this point in my life, I’m not lying, I’m not going to jail. I’m not leaving what I got going on. And they would. If they found out I had lied, they would absolutely move for that. They would love it, love it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/mar/27/lance-armstrong-geoff-thomas-tour-de-france-leukaemia\">High time Lance Armstrong realised that only humility earns redemption | Richard Williams</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Armstrong also took aim at cycling’s world governing body head Cookson, who branded the Texan “completely disrespectful” for looking to ride the Tour de France route this summer for charity. Cookson suggested Armstrong ”would be well-advised not to take part” in former England footballer Geoff Thomas’ charity fundraising mission.</p> \n<p>Thomas has convinced Armstrong to take part in his charity event, riding the Tour route one day ahead of the professional peloton. Cookson said the UCI has no authority to stop Armstrong’s bid, but urged the American to think again.</p> \n<p>Armstrong said: “I mean, I don’t know Brian Cookson. I don’t know what his vision is for the sport. I don’t know if he is even able to form a vision. But I do know that me and Geoff riding in France is the least of his problems. If he is making public comments – and this is as strong as I’ll go – he needs to be talking about other things because this sport is not in a good place for a variety of reasons. A lot of it has to do – perhaps some would say – with me. But he doesn’t need to worry about this.”</p> \n<p>And as he prepares to ride in France again, Armstrong is resolute that he will not get a frosty reception.</p> \n<p>“People think I have this bitter relationship with the country, with its people,” he said. “I like going there. I love France … I could be wrong, I’ve been wrong plenty in my life, but I’ve been to France since all this happened and if you walk into a cafe or a restaurant or walk down the street that [negativity] is not the reaction I get. God forbid the reaction is positive.

Alberto Salazar </a>and training partner Galen Rupp, after the Guardian was able to confirm he was contacted by the BBC nearly a month before the Panorama programme was aired.</p> \n<p>When Farah faced the world’s media on Saturday he said he had found out “maybe three to four days before”, adding “they asked me some questions, like have you taken thyroid”. However, the Guardian has seen the BBC’s initial email to Farah and his agent Ricky Simms, which is clearly dated 6 May, four weeks before the programme was broadcast. That email, which was sent to both men’s personal accounts, revealed that the BBC was working on a 60-minute documentary about drugs in athletics but did not intend to make any allegations that Farah himself had broken any rules.</p> \n<p>Crucially, however, it stated that they were investigating “a number of claims about alleged breaches of Wada [World Anti-Doping Agency] rules, including the use of prohibited drugs, involving your coach Alberto Salazar and your Nike Oregon Project [NOP] team-mate Galen Rupp”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/mo-farah-alberto-salazar-doping-allegations-false-statements\">Mo Farah’s coach says accusers are ‘knowingly making false statements’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Farah was then asked a number of short questions.

The BBC is understood to have received a reply a fortnight later.</p> \n<p>The Guardian asked Simms to confirm those emails were received and to clarify Farah’s comments from the press conference in light of those emails. He said that it would be best to wait, pending the publication of Salazar’s rebuttal to the BBC and Panorama, which is expected by the end of the week.</p> \n<p>In a statement to the Guardian on Monday, Salazar – who heads the prestigious Nike Oregon Project where Farah has trained since 2011 – promised to “document and present the facts as quickly as I can so that Galen and Mo can focus on doing what they love and have worked so hard to achieve”. It is also understood that Salazar, who was also contacted by the BBC on 6 May, is preparing a number of documents, emails and sworn testimony to back up his case.</p> \n<p>Farah is now back in Portland, having <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/07/mo-farah-pulls-out-of-diamond-league-race\" title=\"\">pulled out of the Birmingham Grand Prix </a>on Sunday after feeling emotionally and physically drained, and is not scheduled to race again until the Anniversary Games in London at the end of July.</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion that Farah has committed any offence, and at the press conference on Saturday he admitted he was angry that his name was being “dragged through the mud”. In a polished performance, Farah answered every question fully and comprehensively as he told reporters: “I haven’t done anything. That’s why I am so angry. It has affected my foundation, I don’t want kids to think I am doing something dodgy, when I am

World Cup despite the recent string of headline-grabbing incidents involving Manu Tuilagi, Dylan Hartley and Danny Cipriani.</p> \n<p>Tuilagi and Hartley have been excluded from the squad for disciplinary reasons while <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/02/danny-cipriani-arrested-suspicion-drink-driving\" title=\"\">Cipriani is still awaiting</a> the result of a blood test after being arrested on suspicion of drink-driving. Ritchie, however, does not think the image of English rugby has been tarnished and believes the squad’s culture has improved significantly under Stuart Lancaster.</p> \n<p>“I don’t feel let down, I feel disappointed for them and they must feel that as well,” said Ritchie, commenting on the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/15/manu-tuilagi-rugby-world-cup-assautling-police-officer-england\" title=\"\">removal of Tuilagi</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/02/dylan-hartley-quit-international-rugby-england-world-cup\" title=\"\">Hartley from</a> Lancaster’s squad. “This is the moment of a lifetime for them so to miss it is extremely sad. The over-arching position, however, is a good one. I don’t think we have an image problem at all.”</p> \n<p>Ritchie, talking at the launch of the RWC trophy tour 100 days before the tournament’s opening game, also revealed he had spoken to people involved in England’s ill-starred 2011 campaign in New Zealand, including Lancaster’s predecessor, Martin Johnson, to try to ensure there is no repeat this autumn.</p> \n<p>This time the impact of social media, particularly camera phones, will be significantly greater as will the expectation on England as the hosts. “We have spoken to and learnt from those people who were involved in 2011 and are still involved in the England team,” said Ritchie.</p> \n<p>“Stuart, the coaching team ... we have all sat down with the players. I think they’re very clear on their responsibilities as we get nearer to the event. They all recognise its importance and the opportunity it presents for them. I think they get that very clearly and I’m confident we’re in a good place. I have no doubts about the culture, the discipline and the way in which the squad will deal with all the pressures over the next few weeks and months. They will be significant but again that has been planned for.”</p> \n<p>Ticket sales for the tournament have now exceeded 2m and the organisers are confident they will deliver the most financially successful World Cup in history. Ritchie also remains bullish about the host country’s chances on the field. “There is only one focus and that is to make sure we deliver on the pitch. You start off with the belief and the objective that we want to set out and win the World Cup. Will we do it? It is going to be a very hard job but we will give it our best shot.”</p> \n<p>England’s World Cup shirt, meanwhile, will be launched on 6 July and Ritchie has defended the high cost of the latest special-edition jerseys. “People will buy them if they want to buy them. If nobody wants to buy the one at &pound;120 that is the call of the consumer. Nobody is forcing anybody but we think it is a very special shirt and all the funds go back into the game.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433961268776/Chris-Robshaw-Joe-Marler--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Robshaw, right, Joe Marler, left, and James Haskell offer a glimpse of the shirt England will wear at the Rugby World Cup.

The United States, Mexico and Canada are expected to be among those interested in hosting the 2026 tournament. Fifa has ruled the tournament can go to any continent except Asia and was due to be awarded in May 2017 under a revamped process in which all 209 Fifa associations would have a vote.</p> \n<p>Swiss prosecutors and the FBI are looking into the controversial bidding process for the 2018 tournament, to be played in Russia, and the 2022 World Cup, awarded to Qatar. A disputed summary of a Fifa ethics committee report last year ruled there was not sufficient evidence to strip either country of the World Cup but the head of the compliance committee, Domenico Scala, has confirmed it remains a possibility if new evidence emerges.</p> \n<p>The summary, which sparked the resignation of the report’s author Michael Garcia, detailed a list of allegations against Qatar and said Russia had been unable to cooperate because the organising committee had lost all its emails and its rented computers had been returned.</p> \n<p>Following a meeting of the World Cup organising committee in Samara on Wednesday, Valcke insisted the Russian World Cup was on track before the qualifying draw in St Petersburg in July and that no wrongdoing against Russia had yet been proved.</p> \n<p>“Nothing was big enough during the process to say that the final decision was not in line with all the rules and regulations which have been in place. And, in fact, it’s the same conclusion Michael Garcia had in his report,” said Valcke, appearing to suggest he had read the full report.</p> \n<p>Valcke also defended Fifa’s handling of a $10m payment to a Caribbean Football Union account controlled by the discredited Warner. The payment followed a 2008 letter from the South African Football Association to Valcke asking for the money to be deducted for the World Cup budget and sent to a legacy programme to be administered by Warner.</p> \n<p>“I’m signing all the contracts of Fifa,” said Valcke, who began his job several months before the money transfers in early 2008 to accounts controlled by Warner.</p> \n<p>Valcke, who said he had not been questioned by Swiss authorities or the FBI over the payment, insisted the alleged bribe money did not belong to Fifa and questioned why he was targeted by international media. “You have decided that after Blatter, my head is to be cut. Fine, but don’t say it is because of this $10m.”</p> \n<p>Vitaly Mutko, the Russian sports minister who is also head of the 2018 organising committee, said Swiss and US investigations into the Russian bid would find nothing improper. “Do not rock this boat,” he warned. “They said already that Germany wrongfully got their World Cup, or Britain hosted some wrong reception for &pound;40,000. And now it will all snowball. We should understand that we acted within the legal football framework that existed at the time.”</p> \n<p>His comments were a reference to suggestions in the German media that trade deals played a part in Germany securing the 2006 World Cup and the FA’s decision to pay for a Concacaf dinner in the Caribbean. Blatter confirmed his departure in Zurich last week and said he would stay as president until the election, due to be held between December and March. The date of that election will be confirmed at a Fifa executive committee meeting in Russia next month, before the preliminary World Cup draw, with mid-December one possible option.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the head of the German FA has called for term limits for the Fifa president and suggested the one member, one vote system for Fifa’s 209 associations should be revisited. Wolfsgang Niersbach also recommended that preliminary technical reports should be used to weed out the weakest candidates for the World Cup.</p> \n<p>“If Fifa had deployed this process then Qatar, with the weakest technical evaluation, would not even have reached the vote,” he said.</p> \n<p>The pressure on Fifa will grow on Thursday when the European Parliament calls on Blatter to step down immediately. The motion, which expresses the parliament’s “long-held view” that Fifa is full of “systemic, widespread and persistent fraud and corruption”, says Fifa’s credibility will not be restored until Blatter goes and widespread reforms are instituted.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the Brazil legend Zico has confirmed he intends to stand for the presidency of Fifa, insisting it is his “duty”.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433963800042/J-r-me-Valcke--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jérôme Valcke, the Fifa secretary general, said he had not been questioned by Swiss authorities or the FBI over a controversial $10m payment.

The chief scout, Graham Carr, and club ambassador Bob Moncur have also been given seats on the board, in a move the club feels adds strength to its football operation. Newcastle will be the only Premier League club with its head coach also a presence at board meetings and the managing director, Lee Charnley, described the move as a positive step forward.</p> \n<p>“I am delighted that Steve, Graham and Bob will be joining me on the board,” Charnley said. “It was particularly important to make the head coach a board member in order to gain a full understanding and appreciation for the club as a whole, not just the football side. In Steve, we have an individual willing to embrace that responsibility.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/10/steve-mcclaren-newcastle-mike-ashley-buys-players\">Steve McClaren can revive Newcastle if Mike Ashley buys him the players | Louise Taylor</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While Ashley appears willing to step aside and let the football board deal with the day-to-day running of the club, there is no suggestion he intends to relinquish any personal power or responsibility. He was never the most enthusiastic attender of board meetings in the past and is expected to continue to exert the same level of control over the club’s commercial direction. While the reshuffle may be partly to appease fans who resent his position as a figurehead, it could also be seen as a tacit admission that Ashley got a big football decision horribly wrong last season, in deciding not to replace Alan Pardew and almost suffering relegation as a result.</p> \n<p>The long-expected appointment of McClaren is much more straightforward. The coach sacked by Derby County after failing to reach the play-offs has signed a contract for an initial three years, which could be extended to eight. The club has made advances to McClaren before, notably in his Middlesbrough days in 2004 and as recently as January after Pardew left, but in both cases he felt loyalty to the clubs that employed him and decided the timing was not right. This time the 54-year-old was available and he claimed his interest in Newcastle was revived as soon as Ashley made his promise at the end of last season to stick around until the club won something.</p> \n<p>“I am privileged to be appointed head coach of Newcastle United, this is a big club with a wonderful heritage,” McClaren said. “There is a lot of work to do but the club has made it clear about wanting success and I would not have come here if I didn’t believe they were serious. I know how important Newcastle United is to the city and the region. The supporters are some of the most loyal, passionate and devoted in the world. This club has waited far too long to win a trophy, we owe it to the supporters to do everything we can to reward them with success. I am determined to give the supporters a team they can be proud of. I have already won trophies as a manager and a club the size of Newcastle should be winning cups and finishing in the top eight of the Premier League.”</p> \n<p>McClaren has, indeed, won trophies as a manager, the League Cup in 2004 and the Dutch title with Twente in 2010, although whether that makes him the sort of saviour who can guide Newcastle to their first silverware since Kevin Keegan’s side came up from Division One as champions in 1993 is a moot point. Newcastle have not won anything at the top level since the FA Cup in 1955, or the Uefa Cup – when it was still known as the Fairs Cup – in 1969, and managers of the calibre of Keegan, Kenny Dalglish, Graeme Souness and Sir Bobby Robson are among those to have endured that drought.</p> \n<p>McClaren left Middlesbrough after modest success to manage England, an episode that did not end well, and although he showed courage and application in rebuilding his career in the Netherlands, he was subsequently dismissed from posts at Wolfsburg and Derby and resigned as Nottingham Forest manager after taking only eight points from his first 10 league games.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Newcastle’s managing director called him an “innovative and forward-thinking coach”, a description that seemed to skip several recent events and settle instead on the reputation McClaren enjoyed around the time he joined Manchester United as assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson. “He can develop and improve players, which was a key quality we sought,” Charnley said. “He has been tasked to secure a top-eight finish and heavily incentivised to try to win a cup competition but the immediate focus will be assessing the squad and appointing his backroom staff.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957066126/Steve-McClaren-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Steve McClaren has signed a three-year deal with Newcastle which could be extended to eight.

Having agreed to provide the prize money, the Qataris immediately set about trying to win some of it back by purchasing two horses fancied for races at Royal Ascot next week, including King Of Rooks, an impressive winner of Sandown’s recent National Stakes.</p> \n<p>Those behind the sponsorship deal repeatedly declined even to hint at the sum of money involved but one report has guessed at &pound;50m and that is not being criticised. The deal runs until 2024 and a simple process of adding up the prize money for the races involved over that time suggests that figure may even be on the low side.</p> \n<p>The deal is between Ascot, Newmarket, British Champions Series and Qipco, which is the investment vehicle of Qatar’s ruling Al Thani family. Since 2011, Qipco has been the backer for the Champions Series of 35 top British Flat races as well as an increasing number of the races themselves and the total prize money for those contests has, according to a BCS press release, risen 50% to &pound;17.4m over that time.</p> \n<p>The parties involved have stated a couple of early prize money ambitions in light of the new deal. Their plan is for Champions Day at Ascot in October to be worth &pound;5m by 2024, while the 1,000 and 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket will be made up to &pound;500,000 from next year, an increase of almost 25% in the case of the fillies’ race.</p> \n<p>Qipco became Ascot’s first official partner last year as a result of its investment at the royal track and that status has now been extended to 2024, entitling the firm to branding rights during two days of the Royal meeting each year. Nick Smith, Ascot’s spokesman, put the benefits of this deal in context when he described it as “unprecedented for both us and the wider industry”.</p> \n<p>Having such a long-term and well-funded commitment would, Smith said, “give us the confidence to be able to plan ahead. We’re going to look in the round at where we stand and have a think, over the rest of the year, about the way we should be using this investment.</p> \n<p>“Of course there will be prize money increases on the back of these deals and we have to find the balance between investing in prize money and our facilities. Prize money is not the whole deal but it is fundamental.”</p> \n<p>As news of the deal was released, Deloitte simultaneously published a report on the various means by which Qipco has invested in British racing in recent years. Again, the writers fought shy of reaching a global figure but mentioned 95 people employed, directly and indirectly, as well as capital investment of more than &pound;10m at the two stables owned by the firm.</p> \n<p>Al Shaqab, the name under which Sheikh Joaan al-Thani owns horses, has purchased a pair of promising two-year-olds, it emerged on Wednesday. King Of Rooks is the 5-4 favourite for next week’s Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot, while Easton Angel is third in the betting for the Queen Mary Stakes at 11-2.</p> \n<p>The pair are expected to stay with their current trainers, respectively Richard Hannon and Michael Dods. Only 50% of Easton Angel was sold and Paul Mulrennan keeps the ride as part of the deal.</p> \n<p>Cirrus Des Aigles will miss what would have been a keenly anticipated clash with Treve at Saint-Cloud later this month after discovery of what his trainer, Corine Barande-Barbe, described as “a little bump and a bruise” on one leg.
