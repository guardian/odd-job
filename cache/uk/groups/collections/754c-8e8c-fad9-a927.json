Those that did turn up sat huddled and swaddled but such has been the pace at which this match has been played, it is virtually a day ahead of where it might have been expected to be, enough to warm the cockles.</p> \n<p>Shortly before lunch on the third day England, after some real tribulations against the second new ball, were finally all out for 350, which meant that the sides had tied on first innings, something of a rarity, and the match had therefore become a one-innings game. This, of course, is a format in which New Zealand excel and England do not. Even if they could not literally do so, the Black Caps could mentally don their one-day uniforms (perhaps they did, beneath their whites) and play accordingly.</p> \n<p>It was exhilarating stuff once more from them as they overcame the loss of two early wickets to Stuart Broad, enjoying an oddly successful match, and rattled along at a rate that for a while reached 10 runs per over and barely less than five throughout.</p> \n<p>By the end of a day extended almost to half past seven because of time being made up following previous rain, it was New Zealand, on 338 for six, who held the upper hand. BJ Watling, the wicketkeeper who is playing in this match as a specialist batsman because of a knee injury sustained at Lord’s, completed his fifth Test hundred shortly before stumps on Sunday evening and resumes on the fourth day on precisely 100, from 137 balls with 13 fours and a six.</p> \n<p>No New Zealand player has made a century on this ground before. Long before he reached that the statistical columns were being perused for precedents in the fourth innings of a Headingley Test.</p> \n<p>The omens are not good as far as England are concerned for, although New Zealand have to win this match to draw the series, their enterprise has given them time both to put the game out of England’s reach while allowing themselves the necessary overs to complete the job.</p> \n<p>Already it can be said that there has been only one score made in the fourth innings at Headingley in excess of that which England would require now – albeit in a winning cause, when in 1948, Australia made 404 for three, thanks largely to a second-wicket stand of 301 between the opener Arthur Morris and, inevitably, Don Bradman. Brendon McCullum may have once described Alastair Cook’s run scoring as Bradmanesque but neither he nor anyone else in the team is another Bradman. In a series that has already seen records broken, another may well now be required for England to win the match and series. Only the weather can help secure a draw.</p> \n<p>Chasing now will be tricky, though, no matter how long England are given to bat. The pitch has largely played well when the sun has been out, becoming capricious only when low cloud has pressed down on the ground.</p> \n<p>Then the ball has swung, to be used superbly by Trent Boult and Tim Southee. But even when the sun was out in the final session there were signs of erratic bounce with some deliveries from the seamers squatting and one off-break from Moeen Ali that bounced alarmingly from a length to flick the glove of Watling, then 50, and provide a difficult chance for Jos Buttler which he spilled. Far from winning the match, it is no exaggeration to say that England could lose it by 150 runs or more.</p> \n<p>At times England have had the game within their grasp and let go. In making 350 New Zealand certainly got more than they ought, not least because of some unfathomable England bowling that eventually brought Broad a five-wicket haul that he might not wish to tell his grandchildren about.</p> \n<p>Even then, when Adam Lyth and Cook added 177 for the first wicket, they looked in control until the second new ball cost them six wickets for 33 runs, offset only at the end by some hearty, often agricultural, hitting from Broad that brought him 46 of the 83 runs squeezed out of the last two wickets.</p> \n<p>After more overnight rain and another delayed start, the gloomy conditions were perfect first thing for pace bowling, which Southee in particular exploited beautifully, getting rid of Ian Bell immediately (since his Antigua century, he has made 11, 1, 0, 0, 1, 29 and 12), followed by Buttler and Moeen, all to smartly taken slip catches, an area in which New Zealand – unlike England, who have dropped too many catches – have capitalised fully when the chances have come their way.</p> \n<p>Once again, the new ball did some early damage, although by now the cloud that had contributed to the England batting collapse had disappeared. But Broad found the inside edge of Tom Latham’s bat and the outside of that of Kane Williamson before Martin Guptill, coming into the innings with successive noughts to his name, and Ross Taylor counterpunched so strongly that their eventual partnership of 99 came from only 87 balls before Taylor became one of three victims for Mark Wood.</p> \n<p>Guptill followed, well taken at third slip by Joe Root to leave New Zealand 141 for four and the innings was in the balance. McCullum and Watling restored the equilbrium with a fifth-wicket stand of 121, of which McCullum made 55, from 99 balls, (relatively sedate for him) before Wood had him lbw.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Cricket/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433098768298/England-v-New-Zealand-2nd-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"BJ Watling hits out at Headingley en route to finishing day three on 100 not out in New Zealand's second innings against England.

We saw they got quick wickets [on Sunday morning]. If we can do the same and chase 370, then perhaps, with the amount of time left in the game, who knows?</p> \n<p>“If we have two days to do it and with the character there is in the dressing room, then that is possible. Guys like Joe Root and Gary Ballance [both of Yorkshire] didn’t get going in the first innings but they are playing at home. It will be a big ask but, with the time left, anything is possible.”</p> \n<p>While Gibson’s positivity is commendable, the likelihood of New Zealand levelling the series in this second and final Test remains odds-on after their impressive approach with the bat that has seen a run-rate of 4.5 achieved in both their innings and the crowd, which thinned out from Saturday’s near full house, get full value.</p> \n<p>“It is exciting to watch from the stands – you are getting your money’s worth – but in our dressing room we have be mindful of teams coming at us,” said Gibson. “We have to be able to stem the flow of runs and find a way to take wickets. New Zealand play the way they play and that is led by the captain [Brendon McCullum]. We are more conservative in our approach but that doesn’t make us less of a side. Let’s see how tomorrow and Tuesday unfolds.”</p> \n<p>New Zealand’s BJ Watling, playing here as a specialist batsman after a knee injury prevented him being named as wicketkeeper, scored his fifth Test century and is 100 not out after Martin Guptill and Ross Taylor put on 99 for the third wicket in 14.3 overs.</p> \n<p>“BJ played beautifully but then that’s what BJ does. He comes in and fights hard and he played a very fluent innings,” said Guptill, who scored 70 from 72 balls. “We’re not going to see too many better than that.”</p> \n<p>The New Zealand seamer Tim Southee, who took four for 83 in England’s first innings, including three strikes early on day three, also praised Watling.</p> \n<p>“BJ Watling is just a gutsy, determined player and it’s nice to see him get the rewards for the hard work he puts in. If you’d said yesterday afternoon that we would end the day in the position that we are, we would have grabbed it with both hands.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433106791460/Ottis-Gibson--010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ottis Gibson rejoined the England setup in April this year on a series-by-series basis after the departure of David Saker.

He accused the US and UK of trying to seek revenge against him before the meeting to re-elect him in Switzerland last week.</p> \n<p>Blatter said over the weekend the timing of the raid by the Swiss police, who have been cooperating with a long-running FBI investigation, was designed to remove him from office.</p> \n<p>“No one is going to tell me that it was a simple coincidence, this American attack two days before the elections of Fifa. It doesn’t smell right. This has touched me and Fifa,” he said. “There are signs that cannot be ignored. The Americans were the candidates for the World Cup of 2022 and they lost. The English were the candidates for 2018 and they lost, so it was really the English media and the American movement.”</p> \n<p>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has also claimed that the arrests were an attempt to undermine Blatter and destabilise the 2018 World Cup.<br /></p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/39297f3a45009821ca49f475f8541535b47b1dd7/639_46_3516_2109/3516.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2109,"width":3516,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Burnham spoke out amid growing pressure on the English Football Association to do more than condemn Fifa, following a string of bribery charges against senior officials and the refusal of its president, Sepp Blatter, to stand down.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Kirill Kudryavtsev/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-31T09:55:18Z","lastModified":"2015-05-31T23:14:47Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Rowena Mason","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/4/1/1427899403654/Rowena-Mason-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rowena-mason"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["World Cup 2018","Andy Burnham","Fifa","Politics","UK news","World Cup","Russia","Europe","Football","Football politics","Sport","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"football/world-cup-2018","webTitle":"World Cup 2018"},{"id":"politics/andyburnham","webTitle":"Andy Burnham"},{"id":"football/fifa","webTitle":"Fifa"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"football/world-cup-football","webTitle":"World Cup"},{"id":"world/russia","webTitle":"Russia"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"football/footballpolitics","webTitle":"Football politics"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rowena Mason","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rowena-mason"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/31/england-boycott-2018-world-cup-andy-burnham","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49cvd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/may/31/england-boycott-2018-world-cup-andy-burnham","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/31/england-boycott-2018-world-cup-andy-burnham"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/39297f3a45009821ca49f475f8541535b47b1dd7/639_46_3516_2109/3516.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2109,"width":3516,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Burnham spoke out amid growing pressure on the English Football Association to do more than condemn Fifa, following a string of bribery charges against senior officials and the refusal of its president, Sepp Blatter, to stand down.

Most spectators sit on deckchairs or picnic mats. Vast quantities of wurst, beer and candy floss are slurped then sunk. Kids’ races fill any lull in the action. But don’t be fooled. Most of the world’s best multi-eventers congregate here every May – which makes <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/31/jessica-ennis-hill-qualifies-rio-olympic-heptathlon-gotzis\" title=\"\">Jessica Ennis-Hill’s fourth-placed performance here in her first heptathlon since her Olympic gold medal</a> so deeply impressive.</p> \n<p>Her intention when she arrived in Austria was to surpass the 6,200 points needed to qualify for Rio. She smashed it, scoring 6,520. To put that into context, that score would have been good enough for bronze in all but one world championships since 2005.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/31/jessica-ennis-hill-qualifies-rio-olympic-heptathlon-gotzis\">Jessica Ennis-Hill qualifies for Rio Olympic heptathlon in G&ouml;tzis</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It is some achievement. Especially when you remember that Ennis‑Hill has barely run, thrown or jumped competitively for three years because of injuries, pregnancy and the birth of her son Reggie. You wouldn’t expect an opera singer to hit the very highest notes in their first performance after throat surgery, yet Ennis-Hill gave it a damn good blast.</p> \n<p>Of course, there are still areas to work on. Her 100m hurdles and 200m times showed that her speed endurance is not there yet, while on the second day her performances in the long jump and javelin were only steady before an enthralling 800m in which she flashed her athletic teeth, holding off Brianne Theisen-Eaton – the overall victor in G&ouml;tzis – in the process.</p> \n<p>But even Ennis-Hill’s poor events brought a sort of clarity. They showed us how much scope she has to improve. And that cherished ambition to climb on the podium in Rio next year – and to stand on its highest step – is not a pipe dream.</p> \n<p>The record books give some hint of the challenge she faces. Only two athletes have had a baby and retained an Olympic title over a four-year cycle. The Australian Shirley Strickland, who won 80m hurdles gold in 1952 and 1956, had a baby boy, Philip, in 1953. Fran&ccedil;oise Mbango Etone won triple jump gold in Athens 2004 for Cameroon, had a baby boy, Niels, in 2006, then retained gold in Beijing two years later.</p> \n<p>Long-distance athletes, including Liz McColgan and Paula Radcliffe, have also had success after giving birth, but the seven-headed hydra that is the heptathlon is a different beast entirely. It is a supreme test of speed, strength, athleticism and endurance. It demands so much of an athlete. If Ennis-Hill could somehow retain her title, it would surely rank with the great British performances in Olympic history.</p> \n<p>As her coach, Toni Minichiello, explained to me, when she returned to training in November she couldn’t lift heavy weights because her stomach muscles weren’t yet knitted together after her pregnancy. She couldn’t lift anything over her head for three months. And the greater flexibility she had during her pregnancy affected her tendon tension, which has meant her jump speed suffered.</p> \n<p>But there was no textbook to tell Minichiello how best to proceed: when it comes to multi-disciplinary events there is very little in the scientific literature. “People talk about distance runners returning quickly from pregnancy but they can instantly run and jog,” he said. “They don’t need to propel an object from above their head. Or lift heavy weights. It took Jess six, seven or even eight months after giving birth to her son before she could do some things.”</p> \n<p>There is some anecdotal evidence that endurance and, to a lesser extent, strength can improve after pregnancy, but James Pivarnik, a professor at Michigan State University who is one of the world’s leading experts on exercise in the area, says there is not a great deal to back that up.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, when I spoke to Denise Lewis, the 2000 Olympic heptathlon champion, she flagged up another difficulty when she returned after giving birth: more injuries. Lewis came back after the birth of her daughter, Lauren, in 2002, finishing fifth at the 2003 world championships with a score of 6,254, but she was never the same athlete again. No matter how much care she took while she strived to get back to her best, she found her body kept betraying her.</p> \n<p>Yet Ennis-Hill has defied the odds and the achilles niggles that interrupted her training during the spring. The question now is whether she can enjoy 14 months of injury-free training as she travels further along the road to Rio. If she does, the 6,600 points she needs to be fairly certain of Olympic bronze are almost a given. If she can clamber back towards 6,750 points – surely the minimum score that will be needed to fend off Theisen-Eaton, the brilliant young British heptathlete Katarina Johnson-Thompson and possibly Dafne Schippers – then all bets are on.</p> \n<p>Certainly the legendary coach Harry Marra, who trains Theisen-Eaton and the decathlon world record holder, Ashton Eaton, isn’t counting her out. “Jess was under more pressure than any athlete I have ever seen going into London,” he says. “The British press just piled the pressure on but she handled it so well. Retaining her Olympic title will be a big challenge for her, but she still looks really driven. If anyone can do it, she can.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433091224936/Jessica-Ennis-Hill-illust-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jessica Ennis-Hill defied the odds and the achilles niggles that have interrupted her training to finish fourth on her heptathlon return in Götzis.

And looking at my individual scores, some of them are not very special, so to come away with that is great.”</p> \n<p>The decision over whether Ennis-Hill goes to the world championships will be based on two considerations: whether she can put in an uninterrupted block of training over the next three months, and whether she shows enough in training to suggest she is a realistic contender for the podium in Beijing.</p> \n<p>“If I can get the speed work done in that amount of time then I will go,” she said. “If I’m a medal contender I’ll go. But I don’t want to go to the world championships as I’ve come into this event. I want to be more prepared. It’s a long way to go to not be quite ready.”</p> \n<p>Ennis-Hill’s initial target in G&ouml;tzis was to score 6,200, the qualifying standard for next year’s Rio Olympics. But that target was soon demolished – along with even the most optimistic pre-event predictions of her coach, Toni Minichiello. It was an especially noteworthy achievement given that Ennis-Hill had given birth to her son, Reggie, 10 months ago, had problems with her achilles, and is not expecting to be back to her best until next summer.</p> \n<p>Yet suddenly her hopes of defending her Olympic title do not seem fantastical. When asked whether she could get back to her very best she nodded. “Yeah, I’m really encouraged by the weekend’s performances,” she said. “Some of my events have been pretty poor or pretty standard but if I can go and get some proper training in there’s a lot more to come.”</p> \n<p>Ennis-Hill started day two in third place, behind Theisen-Eaton and the Dutch athlete Dafne Schippers, but after a moderate long jump of 6.16m and a javelin of 42.60m – both way below her best – she had slipped to fifth. Schippers withdrew with a knee injury after the javelin, bumping her up a place, but Ennis-Hill was still in a tight scrum of competitors going into the final event of the day, the 800m.</p> \n<p>She knew she needed to run a time of 2:33.02 to ensure she made the Olympic qualification standard – but the way she stormed into the lead from the off showed she wanted to make a statement.</p> \n<p>“I was a bit frustrated at the start of the 800m because felt I could’ve thrown better in javelin and I’d like to have done a better long jump,” she said. “I didn’t quite know what I was going to have in the 800m but as soon as the gun went I just felt really good.”</p> \n<p>On the final straight Theisen-Eaton attempted to overtake her, only for Ennis-Hill to fight back for victory in 2min 09.37sec. But Ennis-Hill denied that she was sending a message to the Canadian. “It was not so much a message to her but a message to myself that I’ve still got that competitive edge, that strength to dig really deep, even when I’m not on for winning or scoring a PB,” she said.</p> \n<p>Ennis-Hill knows, however, that there are still things to work on, especially her sprint speed, which let her down in Saturday’s 100m hurdles and 200m. “I think speed events is something that I’m lacking at the moment, but Toni and I are both just really pleased because we’ve had the frustration of my achilles,” she said. “It’s a really nice feeling to have the team back together and be performing so well.”</p> \n<p>But there was no such joy for Morgan Lake, the talented 18-year-old British heptathlete, who ended a disappointing competition by pulling out of the 800m with 250m remaining. Lake, a double world junior champion last year, had taken a break from her A-Level exams to chase the Olympic qualifying standard but she was falling far short when she suddenly walked off the track.</p> \n<p>“My heart wasn’t really in it and I didn’t have the motivation to go on,” she said. “It was a bit of a push to come out here. I haven’t been able to train but I thought it would be OK. Obviously it wasn’t. It’s not only the training, I haven’t been able to focus on athletics at all.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who pulled out of G&ouml;tzis with a minor knee injury, now knows the scale of challenge she faces in Beijing in August. Theisen-Eaton winning score of 6,808 was the highest in a heptathlon since Ennis-Hill’s 6,955 at London 2012. The prospect of all three heptathletes facing each other in Beijing is a mouthwatering one – although Ennis may yet decide it is prudent to defer the battle until next year’s Rio Olympics.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433087527652/Jessica-Ennis-Hill-at-Got-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jessica Ennis-Hill edges out the overall winner, Canada’s Brianne Theisen-Eaton, in the 800m in the heptathlon in Götzis.

The Scot loves a fight.</p> \n<p>The Pau-born man, who lives in Belgium, will no doubt have his home crowd with him for a second-week appearance many might have considered a bonus for a player who has won his three matches virtually unnoticed – not by Murray, though.</p> \n<p>Not only does he respect the artful tennis of the would-be actor and former Wimbledon junior champion – a contemporary just three months older than him – but he has been handed extra incentive to win by Chardy’s comments about Murray withdrawing in Rome, after beating him in his only match, on the grounds that he needed rest.</p> \n<p>“Everybody is tired,” Chardy said on Saturday night. “So I was a little bit upset when I see he retired because of tiredness. But it’s his choice and, for the moment, he’s doing well. If he wins Roland Garros, everybody will say it was a good choice. If he loses, it will be wrong.”</p> \n<p>The world No3, meanwhile, relishes moments when the temperature rises, especially in the second week of a major championship against an opponent he has beaten six times in seven meetings and who lies 42 places below him in the rankings.</p> \n<p>He also has a near-perfect record against opponents on their home surface. “I don’t mind playing in these kinds of atmospheres,” he said. “Obviously I prefer it when the crowd is behind me but it’s something that you have to enjoy. It’s a challenge and, when you accept it’s going to be the case before a match, you deal with it.</p> \n<p>“I try to prepare myself mentally – ‘OK, the crowd is going to be tough’ – and just get myself in the right frame of mind. I don’t know if all players do that or talk about that with their coach but that’s something I always try to do. I tell myself: ‘When they’re booing me, they’re booing him.’ In football the crowd obviously get pumped when the home team is attacking, whereas in tennis it’s kind of no noise in the middle of the rallies, so it shouldn’t put you off. I try to draw on it.</p> \n<p>“When I was younger it would have affected me but now I feel like I’m experienced and, having won 11 in a row [against home opponents in majors], you experience those atmospheres many times. It’s not something that fazes me. I just go out and play. It’s not like every time I’m playing away it’s been against Rafa [Nadal] or Roger [Federer] or Novak [Djokovic], so I don’t know why I have a good record, but I do enjoy it.”</p> \n<p>Murray’s run of success in hostile situations in the majors is not quite perfect: he lost in five sets in the first round of the 2006 French Open to Ga&euml;l Monfils. Thereafter, though, he has amassed a record of 11 out of 11.</p> \n<p>Across the Tour he is equally impressive in enemy territory: 25 on the spin (barring Davis Cups). Donald Young was the last home player to embarrass him – in March 2011 at Indian Wells.</p> \n<p>As for his excellent record against French opposition (only Monfils and Richard Gasquet have beaten him on French soil), Murray says, “I think it’s a coincidence. Some of the guys I’ve played against, their styles have matched up well for me. I’ve also lost quite a few of them as well [four]. Against Gasquet I was down a couple of sets a few times and managed to turn the match around.”</p> \n<p>Murray is making his charge at the final weekend armed with a noticeably improved serve on clay. Over his career he has won 75 per cent of first serves on the surface; coming into this tournament in his run of 10 straight wins, with two titles, that had zoomed to 91 per cent. In his first three matches here he has kept it a healthy 88%.</p> \n<p>Murray has not gone too hard for the big point, sitting 16th on the tournament table for aces with 21 – with nine double faults. Chardy has 24 aces and seven double faults – so there is not a lot between them in the power and precision department.</p> \n<p>While Chardy has hit more return winners, 19, than anyone in the tournament – compared with Murray’s six – it is the Scot whose defence is stronger overall and by quite a significant margin. He has won 43 per cent of points on return of first serve, 58 per cent on second serve; Chardy’s numbers are 33 per cent and 52.</p> \n<p>So, if Murray’s first serve is firing – which it was not doing consistently against Nick Kyrgios on Saturday – he will cause Chardy problems.</p> \n<p>And, if Murray needed an extra spur to beat the man who questioned his motives for pulling out early in Rome, the prize for winning is a quarter-final against the Croat Marin Cilic, whom he has beaten 10 times in 12 matches, or the Spaniard, David Ferrer, whom he has beaten nine times out of 16 – but not once from four attempts on clay.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/31/1433094725426/Andy-Murray-in-French-Ope-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray is hoping to extend his brilliant run of form against Jérémy Chardy in the fourth round of the French Open on Monday.

The club has said it is “deeply concerned” and has launched an investigation after calls for the trio to be sacked.</p> \n<p>The footage, obtained by the Sunday Mirror, allegedly shows the 22-year-old defender James Pearson, the son of the club’s manager, Nigel, the striker Tom Hopper, 21, and the goalkeeper Adam Smith, 22, naked in a Thai hotel room as women are filmed engaged in sex acts. In a clip of the video posted on the newspaper’s website, one of the men appears to be heard calling one of the women a “slit eye” in a racist slur.</p> \n<p>Later one calls one of the women “minging – an absolute one out of 10” as his friends laugh. Other offensive comments are made to the women as the players appear to laugh and egg each other on. It is alleged the trio shared the explicit video with friends back in the UK.</p> \n<p>In a statement the club said the players “would like to convey their sincere apologies for their behaviour – to the women involved in the incident, to the club and its owners, to the club’s fans and to their families”.</p> \n<p>Earlier Leicester City had released a statement saying: “We take the conduct of our players at every level extremely seriously and will take appropriate action, if necessary, once the full facts of the situation have been established. Pending the outcome of an internal investigation the club will make no further comment.”</p> \n<p>The club, currently touring Thailand celebrating their successful battle against relegation from the Premier League, is owned by the Thai billionaires Vichai and Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha and has been in “strategic, international partnership” with the Tourism Authority of Thailand for three years. The tourism authority’s Amazing Thailand branding is on the back of team shirts.</p> \n<p>Commenting on the partnership last year, Susan Whelan, Leicester City’s chief executive, said: “We’re absolutely thrilled to continue to work with the Tourism Authority of Thailand during the 2014-15 season. Their support in the last two years has been vital in helping us promote Leicester City to a Thai audience and in reaching our goals closer to home.”</p> \n<p>Thawatchai Arunyik, governor of Tourism Authority of Thailand, said: “We are very proud to be working with Leicester City and its supporters, who have embraced the club’s increasingly strong association with Thailand and given the nation a Premier League football club its people can take to their hearts.”</p> \n<p>On Sunday fans told of their disgust on the fans forum FoxesTalk, where one posted: “Get rid of them, never getting near our squad anyway.”</p> \n<p>Another wrote: “Disgusting and inexcusable behaviour, exactly the sort of stuff that gives British tourists a bad name when we go abroad. It’s especially disappointing given the efforts the owners are going to to ensure we’re a popular club in Thailand.”</p> \n<p>A Kick It Out spokesman said: “We are aware of the allegations and have contacted Leicester City Football Club. We will await their response before commenting further.”</p> \n<p>Nigel Pearson has campaigned against racism and is a patron of the charity Show&nbsp;Racism the Red Card. A number of Thai people told of their outrage in comments posted on the Leicester City Facebook page.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433077912651/Leicester-Citys-King-Powe-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Leicester City's King Power Stadium is named after the company owned by their Thai owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha.

In the letter to Prime Minister, released to the media, he said Britain “cannot just be commentators or spectators”.<br /></p> \n<p>The Duke of Cambridge, who is president of the FA, also waded into the controversy by calling on Fifa to “show that it can represent the interests of fair play and put the sport first”.</p> \n<p>However, Greg Dyke, the chairman of the FA, said it was “ridiculous” to suggest England could take unilateral action without the support of other footballing nations in European and Latin America. Dyke said he thought Blatter would not last another four years and the best way of cleaning up international football was putting pressure on sponsors and other countries to take collective action.</p> \n<p>Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show, Dyke said: “Putting pressure on Sepp Blatter is pretty impossible. But putting pressure on other footballing nations and sponsors is a good idea, I think. The duke is ... obviously upset by what’s happened and feels quite strongly about it.”</p> \n<p>He added: “But it would be ridiculous to try to do it on your own. All we’d do is pull out of the World Cup and everyone would say well done and forget all about it. It’s got to be done by enough nations to have an impact if it’s done. But I don’t think Blatter will last four years.
