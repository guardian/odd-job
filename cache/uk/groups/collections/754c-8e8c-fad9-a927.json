The Leicester centre had pleaded guilty to three charges of assault and one of criminal damage, for damaging the wing mirror of the taxi, and was ordered to pay &pound;6,205 in fines, compensation and costs.</p> \n<p>Stuart Lancaster wasted no time in informing Tuilagi that his conviction will end any prospect of World Cup selection and the powerful centre will not be considered again for Test selection before January 2016.</p> \n<p>Tuilagi is also facing internal club disciplinary action following the incident, which took place several weeks ago. Lancaster has always made it clear he expects England players to display the highest standards of behaviour and the England head coach will be both disappointed and frustrated by the 23-year-old’s conduct. “Having spoken to Manu, he understands and accepts both the seriousness of the offences to which he has pleaded guilty and the consequences of his behaviour to his club, country and the game as a whole,” said Lancaster in a terse statement.</p> \n<p>A contrite Tuilagi, who has been recovering from a long-term groin injury, also issued a forlorn statement of apology following the case’s conclusion at Leicester magistrates court. “I take full responsibility for my actions and unreservedly apologise to all those involved in the incident, Leicester Tigers and England. It is something I deeply regret and I totally accept the sentence given by the court. I know as an England player the need to conduct myself as a good role model for the game. I am very disappointed because my actions have let so many people down and I can only hope for a future chance to prove myself again.”</p> \n<p>Tuilagi grabbed a taxi driver by the throat, kicked his wing mirror and then pushed two female officers in the chest as they attempted to handcuff him on Granby Street in Leicester around 3am on Sunday 26 April.</p> \n<p>Privately, England’s coaches will be cursing Tuilagi’s stupidity. Given he was also fined by England at the 2011 tournament in New Zealand for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/oct/09/police-manu-tuilagi-ferry-martin-johnson\" title=\"\">jumping off a ferry in Auckland Harbour</a> his sense of timing remains desperately poor.</p> \n<p>Despite not having played since Leicester’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/oct/18/leicester-ulster-european-rugby-champions-cup-report\" title=\"\">European Cup tie with Ulster in October</a> he was expected to be fit for the start of England’s pre-World Cup training camp starting on June 22. Lancaster is due to unveil his preliminary squad on Wednesday and must now attempt to fill the gaping hole left by the unavailability of his most penetrative midfield back. There are echoes of the case of the Harlequins scrum-half Danny Care, who was excluded from England’s squad for the 2012 Six Nations Championship after pleading guilty to drink driving.</p> \n<p>It remains to be seen how Leicester will respond but the club’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill, appeared to suggest Tuilagi would not be suspended from club rugby when the Premiership restarts in October. “Manu knows and accepts his responsibilities and has received a significant punishment in being excluded from the England squad,” said Cockerill. “While we do not in any way condone his actions in this case, Manu is a young man who has grown up in the public eye and he is a good professional in a top-level environment. We will continue to work closely with him on his return to full fitness and look forward to his return to the field in due course.”</p> \n<p>A succession of injuries have meant Tuilagi has played just four times for England since March 2013, although he did represent the Lions in Australia that same year. It was hoped he would be available for England’s three warm-up games against France (twice) and Ireland this summer but, in his absence, Lancaster must now renew his quest for a world-beating midfield partnership – at his best there is no question that Tuilagi, the youngest player ever to represent England at a World Cup, is among the most destructive ball-carriers in Europe. To date hehas scored 11 tries in 25 Tests for England but his career is in renewed danger of being remembered for all the wrong reasons. The Samoa-born centre was fined &pound;3,000 by the Rugby Football Union for his ferry jumping escapade in 2011 and received a formal warning for disorderly behaviour.</p> \n<p>Tuilagi, one of six brothers to have represented Leicester, was also the subject of official scrutiny in 2010 when he was threatened with deportation after it was revealed he was living in the UK illegally on a holiday visa. Following an appeal, he was granted indefinite leave to remain.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431701590276/Manu-Tuilagi-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Manu Tuilagi, who has not played for England since last summer's tour of New Zealand, will not take part in the Rugby World Cup.

at the Riverside","body":"<p>Aitor Karanka limbered up for this penultimate hurdle on what he hopes will prove Middlesbrough’s road back to the Premier League with a family trip to North Yorkshire’s Flamingo Land.</p> \n<p>When Boro’s manager was spotted making full use of the theme park’s rollercoasters, the cod psychologists had a field day. Yet if the Spaniard regarded it as perfect preparation for a seemingly awkward rematch with Brentford, Karanka could not have been more wrong. In the event his players – with Lee Tomlin outstanding and Grant Leadbitter extremely impressive – simply dissected Mark Warburton’s side with the sort of ruthless efficiency that could serve them well in the top tier.</p> \n<p>There is the small matter of a Wembley final against either Ipswich or Norwich first but the Boro fans who invaded the pitch in deliriously joyous fashion at the final whistle have no doubts about the outcome. “Don’t you worry, we’re going up,” they chanted as Warburton, rather sadly, exited Brentford’s dug-out for the final time.</p> \n<p>A disagreement over recruitment, tactics and statistical models with the club’s board has prompted his imminent replacement. It begs the question who is possibly going to do better than the manager who led them out of League One only last season. Whatever happened to “if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it”?</p> \n<p>“Tonight we were second best but over the season the players have been tremendous,” said Warburton. “There’s disappointment, frustration, sadness, no question,” he acknowledged. “It’s very, very frustrating. But I’d like to think that I leave the club in a better, healthier state than when I arrived.”</p> \n<p>Dignity personified, he made a point of praising Boro: “They’re very strong, very well organised and they’ve got some outstanding players. They’re a big club with Premier League support. They deserved to win and it was their party.”</p> \n<p>After narrowly losing the first leg in west London, the Brentford camp had been a little sniffy about Boro. A gentle moan that Karanka’s side are all set pieces and counterattacks was the gist of it and Warburton’s players immediately set about proving their point with some initially superior passing football. “It was the perfect night but for the first 10 minutes I feared it could be a nightmare,” conceded Boro’s manager.</p> \n<p>Unfazed his players simply retained their shape, pressed diligently and dished out their fair share of wince-inducing tackles as Lee Mason refrained from flourishing what might have been a few early yellow cards.</p> \n<p>Gradually the Teessiders began not only out-muscling Brentford but producing some sweet passing moves. With Leadbitter and Adam Clayton increasingly controlling midfield, “We’re going to Wembley” echoed around the ground.</p> \n<p>That anthem no longer seemed quite such a case of tempting fate once Tomlin curled a wonderful shot into the top corner from the edge of the area. Encouragingly for Karanka, the goal’s preamble was every bit as good as its conclusion. It began with Leadbitter switching play courtesy of a wonderful 40-yard ball and the exciting Albert Adomah rolling a pass to Tomlin before leaving the scorer to do the rest.</p> \n<p>Suddenly the Riverside was rocking in a manner rarely seen since the spring of 2006 and the team’s run to the Uefa Cup final under Steve McClaren. Brentford refused to fold but, scrabbling for half-chances, they must have sensed that Wembley and, possibly, the Premier League, were suddenly blurry, fast diminishing images on their horizon.</p> \n<p>With Adomah offering Jake Bidwell, Brentford’s left-back, an exacting work-out, the visitors wobbled but still came mighty close to equalising from their first realistic chance.</p> \n<p>Half-time was fast approaching when Alan Judge crossed and, for once, the normally dependable Daniel Ayala mis-judged the ball’s trajectory. It fell to Andre Gray who must have cursed as his header deflected off Dean Whitehead and into the grateful arms of Dimi Konstantopoulos.</p> \n<p>A stretching Kike was inches away from connecting with Adomah’s inviting cross early in the second half. At the other end Moses Odubajo delivered a superb low cross of his own but the ball eluded all available defenders before being also missed by a straining Gray.</p> \n<p>With that warning shot, Boro promptly extended their lead at the end of a counterattack notable for the excellence of its execution. When Jota conceded possession, Tomlin dispatched a fabulous through-ball collected by Jelle Vossen. Having held off a defender, he drew David Button from his line and laid off to Kike who lashed the ball into the net before twirling his shirt above his head.</p> \n<p>After Adomah scored the third – stepping inside David Button and shooting unerringly from six yards following an exquisite one-two with the excellent Tomlin – Jonathan Woodgate came off the bench to a standing ovation.</p> \n<p>“It’s amazing,” said Karanka, the strains of “I’m a believer” still echoing from the Riverside’s sound system. “It’s fantastic. I have always dreamt of Wembley and I’ve thanked my players for giving me the opportunity to manage there. They’re amazing lads with amazing spirit.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431723706235/Middlesbroughs-Lee-Tomlin-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Middlesbrough's Lee Tomlin scores the opening goal against Brentford in their play-off semi-final second leg at the Riverside.

Colin Graves, the new chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, pitched up for his first day at the crease already feeling battered and bruised by the all‑encompassing Kevin Pietersen saga that threatens to suck the whole of the sport into its vortex.</p> \n<p>When he agreed to take the job as part of the internal round of musical chairs in which Giles Clarke became the ECB’s first president, Graves probably did not expect to spend his first day evading the questions of a dogged BBC reporter at Lord’s.</p> \n<p>For the past week it is as though the ECB has been in competition with the Labour party to see which can crash to the ground fastest.</p> \n<p>Graves, who likes to think of himself as a straight talker, has endured a baptism of fire ever since he responded to a few gentle looseners from the BBC’s Garry Richardson in early March by saying that Pietersen could only be considered for an England recall if he was consistently scoring runs in county cricket. I was in the Sportsweek studio that Sunday morning and, at the time, it sounded like an honest answer to a reasonable question rather than a clanging gaffe. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/02/colin-graves-kevin-pietersen-england-future\" title=\"\">Pietersen, sensing his chance, shot through the crack of a door that had been reopened just slightly and within two hours was on Sky saying he would have to consider whether to take him up on the offer</a>.</p> \n<p>Graves should have stopped there. But for reasons best known to himself he then went further in an interview with the Telegraph in which he said “what happened in the past is history”. For good measure, he added: “If he does that and then comes out and scores a lot of runs they can’t ignore him I would have thought but that is up to him.”</p> \n<p>So whatever Graves says now, anyone reading those comments would reasonably assume Pietersen had a decent chance of a recall if he returned to county cricket and scored bags of runs. To be absolutely fair to Graves, he also consistently said that it wasn’t him that selected the team.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/01/kevin-pietersen-ecb-england-return-colin-graves\" title=\"\">An ECB spokesman hurriedly added that “nothing had changed”</a> and introduced an addendum to the effect that Pietersen would have to also be seen as “a positive influence”. Muddy waters. Since then, of course, much <em>has</em> changed. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/apr/08/paul-downton-world-cup-england\" title=\"\">departures of Paul Downton</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/09/andrew-strauss-confirmed-director-england-cricket-ecb\" title=\"\">Peter Moores and the arrival of Andrew Strauss as director of cricket have shifted the terms of the debate yet again</a>.</p> \n<p>Graves is angry that his integrity had been called into question by a perception that Pietersen had interpreted his comments as a cast iron guarantee he would win a recall if he scored runs in the County Championship. Clear? The only trouble is, scan through the thousands of words that Pietersen has written and tweeted on the subject and he doesn’t really say that. The closest he came was after hitting <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/12/kevin-pietersen-surrey-century-oxford-mccu-the-parks\" title=\"\">170 for Surrey last month</a>, when he said of his phone conversation with Graves: “He just said to me he wants his best players playing for England and it’s a clean slate.”</p> \n<p>Go back to Pietersen’s emotional missive on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/12/kevin-pietersen-slams-ecb-deceitful-england-snub\" title=\"\">Wednesday and the charges of “deceit” are as much aimed at the new chief executive, Tom Harrison, who&nbsp;he says led him to believe the meeting with Strauss would not be bad news, as Graves</a>.</p> \n<p>All of this semantics and parsing of previous interviews and statements for meaning, hidden or otherwise, doesn’t get us very far. Both sides have at times interpreted, or misinterpreted, the other to suit their agenda.</p> \n<p>Pietersen has definitively won the sympathy of the wider public by playing a blinder in PR terms. The ECB, meanwhile, has muttered about legal restrictions and consistently returned to the notion there may still be a role for Pietersen in the future. It is this element of the ECB’s public rhetoric this week that has been most puzzling.</p> \n<p>First, Pietersen was told that he was almost certainly finished as an England cricketer and then offered an “ad hoc consultancy role” with the one-day side. Then Graves insisted on returning to the theme: “Despite everything, he can work with us to rebuild the relationship and make a further contribution to English cricket.” Er, right.</p> \n<p>At best, the new ECB chairman can console himself with the fact that things can’t get much worse. And one can only hope, for his own sake, that media training comes as standard with the job. His success in business and profile as Yorkshire chairman will not have prepared him for a firestorm such as&nbsp;this.</p> \n<p>“I want to look to the future,” concluded Graves. Don’t we all. But that still seems impossible when the ECB seems so incapable of dealing with the recent past.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431711148630/Colin-Graves-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Proud Yorkshireman Colin Graves took over as the ECB's new chairman on Friday and faced questions over Kevin Pietersen.

A pensioner, lucky enough to have witnessed far better Liverpool teams than the current captain has ever played in, choked up when asked for a tribute by a television reporter outside Anfield. Hundreds have scrawled good luck messages on a giant board in the Liverpool One shopping centre, many urging him to stay. The club’s figurehead for a generation is not out the door but it seems few are ready to relinquish the hope that Gerrard has given Liverpool these past 17 years.</p> \n<p>G&eacute;rard Houllier will be among the crowd for Gerrard’s 354th and final Anfield appearance against Crystal Palace on Saturday and it is worth rewinding to November 2002 for a piece of advice the former Liverpool manager dispensed at a delicate stage in the midfielder’s career. “Stay out of nightclubs now and you can buy one when you finish playing,” said Houllier, unaware at the time that Gerrard’s loss of focus stemmed from his parents’ divorce. He may not own the nightclub, and certainly wishes he had avoided a few more in the intervening years, but as he prepares to head off to a mansion on the California coast with worldwide respect, 10 trophies and more than 700 appearances for his boyhood club for baggage, he can have few regrets.</p> \n<p>The absence of a Premier League winner’s medal is his biggest lament, of course. It is the only silverware available&nbsp;at club level that Gerrard never&nbsp;got his hands on, a fact he will never be allowed to forget. But that space in the trophy room, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/nov/07/chelsea-liverpool-steven-gerrard-slip\" title=\"\">that slip</a>, lends a fitting poignancy to the Liverpool captain’s career. Everyone who has covered Gerrard and his repeated acts of escapology will have resorted at some point to a superhero analogy, and a superhero is never without flaws.</p> \n<p>The greatest void, however, awaits Liverpool. “I asked my staff to describe Steven in one word and they said things like ‘genuine’ and ‘quality,’” said Rodgers. “The word I would use is ‘Liverpool’. Not just Liverpool as a football club but Liverpool as a city.</p> \n<p>“This is a guy who is very much about looking after his people. He loves his city. He’s had a number of opportunities to move to prestigious clubs but Liverpool is his home, he grew up around the corner, this is his place and these are the people he loves. What he’s given to this city, politicians haven’t given to this city.</p> \n<p>“All the work he does for local hospitals and charities goes unheralded. He is a wonderful symbol for the people here and an incredible icon of the club. You see in Barcelona they have the quote ‘more than a club’. You look at Steven Gerrard and he is more than&nbsp;football.”</p> \n<p>Liverpool and Rodgers have had time and reason to prepare for Gerrard’s exit as age catches up with the once-dynamic midfielder and the manager’s system sometimes strains to accommodate his captain. Yet this season has still delivered examples of the indefatigable spirit that will always be associated with the club’s fifth European Cup triumph in Istanbul.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/dec/09/liverpool-basel-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Against Basel in December</a>, with Liverpool needing victory to reach the knockout phase of the Champions League, only the 34-year-old Gerrard reached the standard required, his late goal earning a draw but not a reprieve on a par with Olympiakos a decade earlier. Then Liverpool ended <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jan/05/afc-wimbledon-liverpool-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">a banana skin of a third-round FA Cup tie at AFC Wimbledon in January</a> indebted to two goals from Gerrard, on his first appearance since announcing his decision to leave the club for LA Galaxy. Who shoulders that responsibility now? The reluctance to accept that Gerrard’s time is over and the fixation on when he is coming back arguably stems from the fact there is no obvious answer.</p> \n<p>Liverpool should be adding experience and character to a young team that has fallen short at crucial moments, not letting it ebb away, although that is the inevitable consequence of a transfer strategy that focuses on potential while personalities such as Gerrard, Luis Su&aacute;rez and Jamie Carragher move on. Balance is essential but the scales appear to be tilted one way at Anfield.</p> \n<p>Gerrard’s absence will be acutely felt off the pitch. Even with the legs tiring, he retains a status at Liverpool that no one around the first team can rival. After 17 years and a lifelong allegiance to the club, he knows the standards required. He sets them. It is when he walks into the changing room that the jokes stop and the jokers listen. “He sets the lead every day,” Rodgers admitted on Friday. “He never has a lazy day. His mind never wanders far from performing well every single day. He gives his maximum in every session and that drip-feeds through into the other players.”</p> \n<p>It is not only at Melwood where Gerrard’s captaincy carries weight. Once, on a flight to a Champions League away game, he overheard a stewardess telling a colleague she had had little time to attract sponsorship for a charity mountain trek she had committed to. Gerrard asked how to use the PA system on the plane, stood up and asked everyone on board to put their hands in their pockets for the stewardess’s chosen charity. We all complied. A few months earlier he had walked up and down the aisle of the same plane placing the European Cup on passengers’ heads.</p> \n<p>The phrase “a symbol of Liverpool” has been used frequently ahead of Gerrard’s final game on home soil and it will no doubt have occurred to Fenway Sports Group that they will lack one as the owner pushes the club as a global brand for commercial profit. Gerrard’s No8 shirt remains by far the biggest seller in Liverpool stores around the world. Rodgers claims he is unafraid of the void Gerrard’s departure will create, although he accepted Liverpool’s big-game mentality was open to question following <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/apr/19/aston-villa-liverpool-fa-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">last month’s FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa</a>.</p> \n<p>“It is going to prove an opportunity for a number of players now to step up,” said the Liverpool manager. “I think for so many years Steven has been the go-to man, not just for this group but for a whole raft of players. This will provide the opportunity for others to show leadership qualities. That’s something I’m looking forward to. Let’s not forget we have won games when Steven has not been playing and won some big&nbsp;games.</p> \n<p>“There is absolutely no doubt with the respect that he has, one because of the level of player he is and the other because of his behaviour, that respect he has carried in the changing room will be missed. But that has shown others the standard you are held at when you are a world-class player. It is an opportunity for the young players to show they can take on the mantle.”</p> \n<p>The argument that Gerrard has plenty left to offer Liverpool is watertight, although it is not accurate to say the club could have retained his services and integrated him on to the coaching staff <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2013/jul/04/ryan-giggs-manchester-united-coach\" title=\"\">as Manchester United have done with Ryan Giggs</a>.</p> \n<p>He has made it plain he could not adapt to a reduced playing role for a team he has often carried over 17 years and the reality, as Gerrard put it this week, “is that I’m getting too old for this level”.

The club are heading into the final two matches of the season facing the deep threat of relegation and the suspension of the midfielder Jake Livermore on Friday, after he tested positive for cocaine use, has added to the malaise.</p> \n<p>In 18th place, two points from safety, Steve Bruce’s team travel to Spurs on Saturday then host Manchester United next Sunday. If Bruce’s players do not recover from last Saturday’s crucial loss to Burnley sufficiently to gain the points they need, relegation will end a curious two-season stint in the Premier League, which has been supported by loans from the owner, Assem Allam, of &pound;67m.</p> \n<p>City have been in the top flight for only the second period in their history. The first was 2008-10, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2008/may/25/championship.hullcity\" title=\"\">a promotion achieved after 104 years of Football League sweat and struggle</a>, punctuated by the occasional crisis. Last season at Wembley, City fans in their thousands cheered a valiant performance: 2-0 up within eight minutes, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/may/17/arsenal-hull-city-fa-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">only for Arsenal to win 3-2 with an Aaron Ramsey winner late in extra time</a>.</p> \n<p>Yet for many fans and people in Hull this period of historic achievement has not felt like the best of times, and has instead been soured by bad feeling over issues which have looked unnecessary and avoidable.</p> \n<p>Allam’s insistence that he wanted the club’s name <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/apr/02/hull-city-tigers-name-change-fa\" title=\"\">changed to Hull Tigers</a>, which he said would dramatically improve its commercial prospects, was opposed by many fans who have supported City through bad times and good, and the Football Association council ruled against it. Allam has won his appeal against that ruling, not on the substance of the FA’s argument but on a procedural point based on an opinion expressed by a member of the relevant FA committee to a fans group. It is unclear whether Allam will pursue the name change assertively again – the FA says it requires a new application and is waiting to see if the club will make one.</p> \n<p>That running sore was followed last month by a saga which has further tarnished the club’s reputation. In March, community sports groups which had been using the Airco Arena, alongside the KC Stadium, since both were built by Hull city council with public money in 2002, were suddenly told they had to leave. Allam and his son Ehab, City’s vice-chairman, had decided that Hull City wanted to use that arena to build an indoor 3G pitch for their own academy’s exclusive use, so that they could be passed by the Premier League for category two status.</p> \n<p>Thousands of people were regularly using the arena, which was fully booked by indoor sports groups, some competing at national level, including gymnastics, netball, trampolining, inline skating, basketball, volleyball and badminton. It emerged that in discussions with the council, which was trying to find an alternative site for the 3G pitch, Ehab Allam had asked that the council guarantee planning permission for a new facility would be granted, or, if it were rejected, pay half the &pound;850,000 cost of the facility. Last month the council leader, Stephen Brady, issued a statement spelling out that it is illegal to guarantee planning permission.</p> \n<p>Brady said the council had “bent over backwards” to support the club’s bid to upgrade its academy, but had not even been consulted on the plans to evict the community sports groups.</p> \n<p>“We are extremely sad and disappointed to learn today that the decision has been made to go ahead with the installation of a 3G pitch at the Airco Arena, despite our stated major concerns about the impact on community users,” Brady said.</p> \n<p>The council has stated that it considers the exclusive use of the arena for a professional club’s academy a breach of the lease requiring community use, and has threatened legal action.</p> \n<p>Julie Williams, of the Hull High Fliers trampoline club, which is run by volunteers, said they were given very little notice to leave. Some, not all, clubs have managed to relocate, but to less high-quality sports centres where they cannot host competitions. A gymnastics and trampolining club for pre-school age children has had to be cancelled.</p> \n<p>“I think it is selfish,” Williams said. “The council built the facility with public money – and the stadium, which helped to put Hull City where it is now – but now the club is looking out for itself, not for the rest of the community.”</p> \n<p>The owners are understood to believe it is not a breach of the arena lease to convert it for its academy and the club continues to highlight the community work that it does. The club did not respond to a request for an interview with Assem Allam, including for an update on the status of the Airco Arena dispute.</p> \n<p>Mark Gretton, chair of the Hull City Supporters’ Trust, said he feels “great sadness” about the arena, name change application, and the Allams’ falling out with the council, which has resulted in a proposed expansion of the stadium not being pursued.</p> \n<p>“These should have been the best of our times,” Gretton said, “but they haven’t been. A large proportion of fans are alienated, and in 30 years of supporting, I have never felt further from the club.”</p> \n<p>If Bruce’s team do not clamber to Premier League survival, this will be an ignominious way for Hull City to go down, with a star player testing positive for cocaine, and owners having evicted community volunteers.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/5/15/1431712596515/Jake-Livermore-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jake Livermore's suspension for drug use comes as Hull City face the deep threat of relegation.

The manager talked of the tension and the pressure, of the dire consequences of failure that can nag away at the players and how it could not fail to have a bearing on the team’s desire to make a fast start in the Premier League.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2011/aug/24/arsenal-udinese-champions-league\" title=\"\">Udinese 2011</a> is the one that sticks in Wenger’s mind. He remembers the stifling heat on the night of the second leg in Italy how players such as Medhi Benatia and Kwadwo Asamoah made the Serie A club such powerful opponents and, more than anything, the relief after Arsenal had squeaked home. They won 3-1 on aggregate, with Wojciech Szczesny saving a vital penalty. The payback would come four days later. Arsenal went to Manchester United <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2011/aug/28/manchester-united-arsenal-premier-league1\" title=\"\">in the league and were walloped 8-2</a>.</p> \n<p>Wenger goes back to Old Trafford on Sunday and the Champions League play-off forms the back story. Arsenal are eager to dodge it for a change and they would do so with a win, as it would ensure that they finish above United in the top three. A draw, too, would be a positive result for Wenger’s team and even a defeat ought not to derail them. Arsenal would then need four points from their final two matches – at home to Sunderland and West Bromwich Albion – to make sure of the top three.</p> \n<p>There was a time when Arsenal v United was the game of the season; a heavyweight clash for the championship. Wenger said he had “good, fantastic and very bad memories” of Old Trafford, with the fantastic being the 1-0 win in May 2002 that secured the title. The race for third place does not have the same ring but, to Wenger, there is still something meaningful at stake.</p> \n<p>“It’s very important for your season preparations not to have that kind of stress of the play-off over your head from the first day you start again,” he said. “We know what it means and we know it’s always tricky, because you can play against teams who are in the middle of their championship when you are in preparation.</p> \n<p>“It is the pressure and the consequences of not qualifying that are massive. Every day in practice you have to focus on thinking you have to be ready on that day. When you qualify at Udinese, it is a relief but days later you go to Old Trafford to get exactly the same focus. You know you have more chance to lose the game than to win it, so sometimes you pay the price in the Premier League.”</p> \n<p>Wenger said that a play-off – and the uncertainty over whether the club would make the Champions League group phase – could affect the incoming transfer deals. “It is difficult,” he said. “They think that most of the time you’re playing in the Champions League but you’re not sure. The only thing we can say to convince them is that statistically we have always done it.”</p> \n<p>There is also the issue of players who may be involved in the Copa Am&eacute;rica and not be fully up to speed by August. Wenger stands to have three players in Chile for the tournament which kicks off on 11 June – Alexis S&aacute;nchez (the hosts), David Ospina (Colombia) and Gabriel Paulista (Brazil). The final is on 4 July and Wenger always likes to give his players at least a four-week break.</p> \n<p>If Arsenal win the FA Cup, they will play the Community Shield on 2 August. The new league season begins on 8 August, with the first leg of the Champions League play-off scheduled for 18 or 19 August. “What is even more important now is that the international competitions force you most of the time to start the new season without your players,” Wenger said. “You cannot give them a long enough rest when they have played international games. You also know in England that we have no break in the winter. That is sometimes difficult to deal with.”</p> \n<p>Wenger expects United to spend heavily again this summer. “It looks to be that United are on the market,” he said. “Every player I’m offered they are in for.” But Wenger was more concerned with following up <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/09/manchester-united-arsenal-fa-cup-quarter-final-match-report\" title=\"\">March’s FA Cup win at Old Trafford</a> with another “symbolic statement”. “To reproduce that would be psychologically important,” he said. “It would convince us more that we have made progress and can be even stronger next season.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/15/1431704241039/Alexis-S-nchez-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Arsenal's Alexis Sànchez scored a vital goal in their Champions League play-off win against Besiktas in August 2014.

This year they may have been settled when the team sheets were submitted on Friday lunchtime.</p> \n<p>Northampton, with a home semi-final already bagged, are entitled to shuffle their resources but the selection of a weakened Saints team to face Leicester has done little to boost the scheduled last day drama.</p> \n<p>By resting Courtney Lawes, Tom Wood, Calum Clark, Samu Manoa, Stephen Myler, Luther Burrell and the Pisi brothers, the Saints’ director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, will not endear himself to supporters of Exeter Chiefs, whose prospects of qualification for the play-offs will be directly affected by the Welford Road outcome. Unless the likes of James Craig and Teimana Harrison can upset a strong-looking Tigers pack, Exeter will have to rely on a hapless London Welsh wrong-footing Saracens in Oxford.</p> \n<p>The counter-argument is that the Premiership table is a product of eight months’ effort, not only 80 minutes’ worth. The Tigers have rarely endured a tougher slog than this season, their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/20/bath-leicester-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">45-0 hammering at Bath in September</a> was among the most painful in the club’s history, they have not always had the best of injury luck and now, on the eve of this final weekend, Manu Tuilagi’s assault conviction has done further damage to their public image. Small wonder their players are approaching the game like parched desert nomads who have glimpsed a soothing oasis.</p> \n<p>Title success may still prove a mirage but, of the three teams jostling for the final two play-off places, there is no doubt Leicester are the most grateful. “If you consider how we played in the early part of the season, to be third in the table speaks volumes for the guys who’ve been involved week-in week-out,” said Ed Slater, their captain.</p> \n<p>Which invites the burning question: how much do the Tigers have in this year’s tank after all their trials and tribulations? They may have scored 39 fewer tries than Saturday’s opponents Northampton but their defensive record is the league’s equal-best and late-season motivation is not an issue. Slater, only just back from a serious knee injury which had sidelined him since August, remembers the sense of creeping horror he felt eight months ago in Bath, where he was working as a pundit for BT Sport. “Martin Bayfield had moved a few seats away from me by the end. I just couldn’t get my head around what I was seeing. The players were shellshocked. It was a really difficult loss to take.”</p> \n<p>Almost as bad has been the subsequent sniping from ex-Tigers unimpressed by the modern generation and the imminent departures of Geoff Parling, Jamie Gibson and Julian Salvi. “It pisses me off a little bit,” Slater continued. “I read the stuff Neil Back put in the paper, taking digs at the club. It’s quite easy to pick holes from the outside. But when you’re losing a lot of players to internationals and injury, it’s hard to deal with. We know what we’re trying to do, regardless of what people say.”</p> \n<p>Slater thinks the old stagers do not fully appreciate how tight the league is becoming. Disagreements behind the scenes have clearly occurred but Ben Youngs offers the starkest analysis. “Even in European games we haven’t had our normal physical edge,” England’s scrum-half said, citing the long-term absence of Tuilagi through injury this season as the key factor. “When he plays he’s everything to us. Take him out of the team and you can see people looking around wondering how are we going to deal with his absence.”</p> \n<p>Even without Tuilagi, who remains injured and could face disciplinary action from his club after his conviction, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/09/wasps-leicester-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">last week’s much-improved performance at Wasps</a> may have reignited the Tigers’ former spark. The 40-year-old Brad Thorn, finally heading towards retirement, makes comparisons with the Brisbane Broncos rugby league side he once represented: “In 2005-06 we lost five or six games during the year and still won the title. Everyone said we were old – and that was when I was 31! It’s not always about what happens in the first quarter of the season. If you can get into that top four it’s all on.”</p> \n<p>When it comes to “big-time footy”, as Thorn refers to it, Exeter remain relative rookies, never having finished in the top four before. The mathematics may be problematic but the Devonians can hardly be dismissed as lucky should they make it. “Do we deserve to be in the top four?” asks Rob Baxter, their head coach. “I was talking about it with my wife this week. If you look at the Premiership table we’re on the same number of points as Saracens and one behind Leicester with one game left. The scoreboard doesn’t lie. We deserve to be there.”</p> \n<p>It is not only the firm conviction of the club’s soon-to-depart Australian captain Dean Mumm – “the hardest thing about semi-finals is making it there” – that the Chiefs, missing Dave Ewerson Saturday, would pose real problems in the last four. Maybe that is another reason for Northampton’s team selection, having lost twice to the Chiefs this season. A third meeting at a sold-out Franklin’s Gardens will unfold only if Exeter can surpass what Saracens achieve against a London Welsh side who have leaked 137 tries in 21 games.</p> \n<p>Either way, there is every chance of Leicester heading back to Bath in the semi-finals, with Youngs among those up for a rematch. “We’re massive dark horses for the title race but if I was at another club I wouldn’t want to play us in a semi-final or a final. Last week it mattered and you could see it in the players’ eyes. We don’t want to be the first Leicester team in 11 years not to make the top four. We’re in a good place in terms of freshness compared with, say, Saracens.”</p> \n<p>Listening to Thorn’s throaty growl, too, you would not bet against Leicester. “We’re here to try and win the comp. Does it mean we’re cocky or arrogant? No. But we have a belief in each other. If we put it out on the field we can challenge as strongly as anyone for the title.”</p> \n<p>There is nothing blurred about the Tigers’ vision as they head towards their play-off oasis.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/5/15/1431696957323/Ed-Slater-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Leciester captain Ed Slater celebrates victory over Wasps at the Ricoh Arena in a much-improved performance.
