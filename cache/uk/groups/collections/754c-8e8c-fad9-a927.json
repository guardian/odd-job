There was nothing towards her.</p> \n<p>“Maybe she was just afraid of my screaming there. I was pretty close to her. I’m definitely going to try to apologise to her if I did something wrong.”</p> \n<p>Djokovic’s safe progress to the quarter-finals came on the 30th anniversary of coach Boris Becker’s first Wimbledon triumph as a 17-year-old.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t know it was today. But he’s going to have a glass of wine, I’ll have a glass of water, and we will celebrate this nice milestone,” Djokovic said.</p> \n<p>Becker said of Djokovic’s performance: “I think that’s a message to the locker room that whoever said he wasn’t ready before, well he’s ready now.”</p> \n<p>The 28-year-old world No1 will face US Open champion Marin Cilic on Wednesday in the quarter-finals.</p> \n<p>They have played 12 times previously, and Djokovic has prevailed each time.</p> \n<p>He will be looking to avoid an unlucky 13th, and the Serb said of his Croatian rival: “He had an exceptional season last year, the best of his life.

She won 3-6, 6-2, 6-3 – her 17th victory over the Belarusian in 20 matches – under skies as gloomy as her prospects were until after an hour of the most intense struggle had passed on Centre Court, but the title looks hers to lose.</p> \n<p>Every time she has reached the quarter-final since failing to do so in Melbourne two years ago, she has gone on to win the big prize – at Roland Garros and Flushing Meadows in 2013, again in New York last year, followed by Melbourne and Paris again this year. That screams determination.</p> \n<p>If Williams does win her sixth Wimbledon title and defends her home championship in September, she will be the first player to do the calendar slam since Steffi Graf in 1988. That would move her level with the German on 22 majors for the Open era record, with surely a year at least in which to add to her collection, time enough probably to pass Margaret Court’s all-time tally of 24.</p> \n<p>All of that is very much for the future. Williams has to beat Maria Sharapova in the semi-final to reach the final on Saturday and although she holds a 17-2 advantage over the Russian, she takes nothing for granted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/serena-williams-caroline-wozniacki-sexist-scheduling\">Serena Williams backs Caroline Wozniacki over ‘sexist scheduling’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Maria’s been playing really well,” Williams said. “It’s always good to see her doing well.” Sure it is.</p> \n<p>More believable were her quick reflections on the quarter-final: “It was really fun out there. I found myself smiling at one point, and Vika smiling too. It’s been an up-and-down tournament. Somehow I’m still alive.”</p> \n<p>She went on to back Caroline Wozniacki’s calls for the women’s game to be given equal treatment on the show courts. “We’re still fighting on that,” Williams said. “We’ve made some progress but hopefully we’ll keep making more progress. I don’t think it’s limited to Wimbledon. We have this problem at a lot of different tournaments.”</p> \n<p>Azarenka was also keen to talk about sexism, but reserved her criticism for the Centre Court crowd’s audible laughter during the match. “It’s so annoying because guys grunt,” said Azarenka. “I was practising next to [Rafa] Nadal, and he grunts louder than me, and nobody notices that. Why?</p> \n<p>“Both women on the court were trying their hardest and giving everything, and they make noises. Is that a problem for tennis? It happens in every sport.</p> \n<p>“So I think maybe it’s time to just put it aside and not talk about it all the time because this is not what is important when there are two players on the Centre Court.</p> \n<p>“We’ve got to look a little bit past that and see: ‘Oh, my God, Serena played 24 aces.’ Look at the good stuff, stop bringing this ridiculous stuff.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/07/serena-williams-victoria-azarenka-wimbledon-2015-live\">Serena Williams v Victoria Azarenka: Wimbledon 2015 – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And the level here was extraordinarily high for the two hours and three minutes the match lasted although there was an inevitability about the result once they entered the concluding stages.</p> \n<p>It said much about their relationship that Sascha Bajin, Williams’s hitting partner and confidant for eight years, could defect to join Azarenka and the move not generate a whit of unpleasantness. On court it was all business between two rivals who are also good friends.</p> \n<p>Azarenka, who had not dropped a set in these championships, also knew she has never won against Williams on grass. So something had to give and two double-faults in the first game of the match gave the American the earliest possible opportunity to break. She battled through deuce twice to hold. And they scrapped from there pretty much to the final bell.</p> \n<p>At 5.10pm, Serena faced that novel experience: dropping a set to Azarenka on a surface she has come to dominate like no other player of her era. She was two break points down at 2-5, so she found a couple of big serves, a thrashing backhand down the line and got to deuce. Despite a double-fault, she got there. Even when her game is malfunctioning, she is still too good for everyone else.</p> \n<p>At 5.15pm Azarenka had set point and with a final swish of her backhand, she did it. The improbable had become a reality and now all sorts of possibilities opened up. Would breaking that spell liberate her or inspire the feared backlash across the net?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/victoria-azarenka-crowd-laughing-grunting-serena-williams-wimbledon\">Victoria Azarenka hits out at crowd for laughing at grunting in Williams match</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Retaliation started with three Serena aces and a hold to love. However, after exactly an hour and four games into the second set, there was nothing between them and while Azarenka had that first-set cushion to comfort her, Williams used the deficit as inspiration.</p> \n<p>Her shouts grew louder, her returns hit the turf that bit harder but not all her bombs were hitting the mark and that gave Azarenka heart. She knew if she could hold her discipline she had a chance of hanging on. Williams needed an eighth ace to fight through deuce for a slender lead midway through the set. They had entered a mutual destruction pact, it seemed, every stroke loaded and the outcome uncertain in every point.</p> \n<p>Fault lines began to appear in Azarenka’s game as Williams applied unrelenting pressure on her serve. She had to save three break points in the third game but could not save the two she handed up in the fifth, and Williams had the glimmer of a chance she needed.</p> \n<p>From here she has won so many times before – but she found herself mired again in a struggle of her own making, surrendering two break points before holding for 5-2. When Azarenka failed to hold serve, a last, weakened backhand from behind the baseline billowing the net, the balance was firmly with Williams.</p> \n<p>Azarenka pulled off the occasional stunning winner down the flanks, where Williams is always most vulnerable. She saved for deuce with a big second serve and deuce in the fourth game, and held when her opponent hit long. In the seventh game, Williams hit three aces inside a minute to pass 50 for the tournament. It was knockout tennis. Azarenka hit her seventh double fault and fourth ace to stay in the match.</p> \n<p>Azarenka somehow managed a smile as Williams’s eighth ace eluded her swing, but was not thrilled to miss the next one. Williams then saw the comical side of daft mishit to give up break point – and aced again. On match point, Azarenka hit wide. The crowd stood in universal acclamation and the combatants hugged at the net. It was as much a memorable occasion as it was a contest.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436294150126/Wimbledon-day-eight-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Serena Williams celebrates in her match with Victoria Azarenka on Centre Court during day eight of Wimbledon 2015.

Finishing on a team-mate’s bike after a puncture, his triumph means Thibaut Pinot takes over the mantle of unluckiest man in the race. The Frenchman had two punctures in as many minutes to become the only general classification contender to lose time – 3min 23sec – on a stage the peloton approached with extreme caution.</p> \n<p>In a fiendishly tricky opening week of a Tour that is beginning to look like it was mapped by scientists more accustomed to testing the intelligence of monkeys, seven teeth-loosening sectors of cobbles were the latest obstacle placed in front of the 191 remaining riders. On a dry day, most coped admirably and although Chris Froome lost the overall race lead to Martin, the Sky rider could see the positives of his team not having to defend it. “Hopefully the guys can have a bit of a rest over the next few days,” he said. “There’s a lot of racing to go and while Tony’s a good time-trialist, he won’t be up there with us when we go into the mountains.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4f7caa7ac96d7215c0f246964e10b41ad34e723d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436296443864/2a94fe35-b2e2-45c5-868f-de4fd64b32da-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Martin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tony Martin of Etixx-QuickStep celebrates after a late dash earned him the stage win at Cambrai – and also put him in the overall lead.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manuel Blondeau/Manuel Blondeau/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A surface for specialists and a staple of the Paris-Roubaix classic, the risk of disaster on the hellish <em>pav&eacute;</em> of the north is huge, with riders engaging in all manner of reckless tomfoolery in their efforts to get to the front of the bunch approaching each sector.</p> \n<p>With each uneven cobble or hole a potential puncture, buckled wheel or broken clavicle in waiting, tension is high and with crowds sometimes lining each side of what are ostensibly dusty country lanes, barrelling along in the comparative safety of the gutter is not really an option. These cyclists were picking up bad vibrations and their filth-caked faces in the post race “unsaddling” enclosure were a sight to behold.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/07/tour-de-france-2015-stage-four-live\">Tour de France 2015: stage four – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For most general classification contenders apart from Vincenzo Nibali, who is at one with the bumpy stuff, this was a stage to put safety first, which will have frustrated experts such as Geraint Thomas, Peter Sagan and Greg Van Avermaet, who had to concentrate on riding in the service of their team leaders Froome, Alberto Contador and Tejay van Garderen instead of the pursuit of individual glory.</p> \n<p>Sagan finished third, just ahead of Van Avermaet, while Thomas also finished in a main bunch of 35 who almost certainly contained the winner of this Tour. We can only surmise how the race could have unfolded if they had been given free rein, but Martin’s power as a time-trialist meant there was no catching him once he had leapt off the front of the leading bunch and zoomed off into the distance. He held on by three seconds, punching the air triumphantly at having ticked a long overdue box on his already impressive <em>palmar&egrave;s</em>.</p> \n<p>“Having a flat tyre and changing a bike [I thought I had no chance],” he said. “With five [kilometres to go], we were together. Nobody wanted to pull, so I decided to give it a try and go full gas ahead. Somehow I found some power. I don’t know what happened today. I was so nervous. I don’t know how many watts I did – maybe more than I ever did. I’m so happy.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/shortcuts/2015/jul/07/more-than-broken-back-to-stop-tour-de-france-cyclists-fabian-cancellara\">It takes more than a broken back to stop a Tour de France cyclist</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After Monday’s crash, the field lined up in Seraing with one conspicuous absentee. Having been taken to hospital after gingerly finishing a stage he almost certainly should have been forced to abandon on medical advice, Fabian Cancellara was, for the second time this year, found to have two broken lower vertebrae and forced to withdraw. If this was, as seems likely, his final Tour there is something poignantly foolhardy about a courageous veteran nicknamed “Spartacus” going out ashen-faced, bloodied and defiant while wearing the tattered and dirty <em>maillot jaune</em> of race leader.</p> \n<p>A day that promised so much chaos failed to deliver and thick dust rather than mud and its accompanying mayhem was the peloton’s chief tormenter. The ravenousness with which riders snatched proffered drinks on exiting each new purgatory and sent them towards open mouths was telling.</p> \n<p>In the early cobbled sectors Nibali and his team-mates briefly threatened but they were unable to shake off a chasing posse that would later blow an opportunity to drop Contador as they squabbled among themselves over who should make the pace.</p> \n<p>So after four stages, Martin is finally in yellow and seems likely to remain in it until Friday at least. After fascinating, tense and often fraught racing, stage five should be one for the sprinters to contest the first mass bunch finish as the Tour reaches the scene of one of the bloodiest battles in history and rolls into Amiens, the capital of the Somme.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/ng-interactive/2015/jul/01/tour-de-france-2015-stage-by-stage\">Tour de France 2015 – stage by stage</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/7/1436286068233/Tony-Martin-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tony Martin is ecstatic after winning the fourth stage of the Tour de France and winning the yellow jersey.

Apart from that passing concern, all is serenity and confidence in a camp that was in a state of flux this time 12 months ago.</p> \n<p>Mauresmo and Murray could hardly be getting on better after a year together. Heavily pregnant and due to return to Paris after these championships, she will leave Murray in the care of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/jonas-bjorkman-andy-murray-coach-wimbledon-2015\" title=\"\">Jonas Bjorkman for the rest of the season</a> and, almost certainly, the Australian Open in January. But she sees no cause for concern. “A lot of things [are better than last year]. For him, on the court, feeling fit and thanks to the medical part of the team, the teamwork has been going well,” Mauresmo said. “When you feel strong physically on court then you are capable of using all your tools out there. For a guy like Andy it makes a big difference. I like the relationship that we have. I would not have stayed around if the human part of the relationship wasn’t going to be good. I would also not stay around if the results were not good or if he wasn’t happy with that.”</p> \n<p>She added: “I’m happy because he is such a hard worker. Since we met again in December in Miami, he has put in so much effort in his daily practice, recovery, food, whatever you can think of. He’s a great guy to work with.”</p> \n<p>It was during that training block that Mauresmo experienced her first bouts of morning sickness. “December and January were a bit tough for me, let’s put it that way,” she said. “I don’t think he [Murray] noticed anything. You feel more tired, definitely, but it was a big challenge. Dani [Vallverdu, his long-time assistant, who is now with Tomas Berdych] had left the team and it was just me. We had not yet found someone to share the time, so basically you have no choice. I hit with him at the French Open a little bit.”</p> \n<p>So, what of the pressure of motherhood, her commitment to Murray and the travelling involved? “It’s too hard for me to say now. There are too many unknowns. I’m taking it as it comes and I’ll know more in a few months. I don’t know what to tell you.”</p> \n<p>She is certain, though, of Murray’s preparedness for the remaining matches of Wimbledon, secured in the most trying of circumstances in his four-set victory over the 6ft 11in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/andy-murray-wimbledon-2015-ivo-karlovic\" title=\"\">Croat Ivo Karlovic on Monday</a>. “I think he did great. He handled many different moments in the match in a very good way,” she said. “The focus and the concentration that you need to have against this guy are very high and he did that very well. Also the physical intensity was great.”</p> \n<p>And what of Pospisil, who comes to the match after three five-setters in a row, as well as a doubles match against Andy’s brother, Jamie, that ended in defeat after three hours and 19 minutes? “Although it’s the first time for him at this level of a tournament, I think he’s going to go out there and have nothing to lose and just go for his shots. He’s a big guy, he can release big shots on the serve and on the forehand. He can come forward as well, good at the net. He’s a pretty consistent overall player. This one needs to be taken very seriously.”</p> \n<p>Of Murray’s many fine qualities, the one to shine through here has been his versatility in dealing with four opponents of vastly contrasting styles. Mauresmo recognises that strength and says she, Murray and Bjorkman combine in working out a strategy for each occasion: “Andy has pretty much everything in his game. As coaches, that’s pretty nice. It’s a privilege.”</p> \n<p>When the last ball is struck, she will go home to Paris and Murray will take the short drive back to Oxshott. “He’s at home and after the job is done we all go our separate ways. Which is what he did all the time with Ivan [Lendl], including tournaments other than here,” Mauresmo said. “We are spending more time together and that’s the nice part.”</p> \n<p>How times change: Dimitrov, who lost here to Richard Gasquet on Saturday, has announced he is parting company with his coach, Roger Rasheed. It is thought the straight-talking Australian was keen for the Bulgarian to move out of the shadow of his partner, Maria Sharapova.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436286459592/Wimbledon-Championships-2-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray with his coaches Amélie Mauresmo and Jonas Bjorkman during his training at Wimbledon.
