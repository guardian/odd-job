It was Lloyd’s second goal but first in the run of play in this tournament, where she and her teammates have been relatively quiet on the goalscoring front.</p> \n<p>In the first half, the Americans looked their best in five games in Canada. Looking less reliant on putting balls in the air toward the box, USA kept the ball on the ground, used short passes to connect up the field and held on to possession.</p> \n<p>Coach Jill Ellis said it wasn’t a new tactical strategy, but “this team steps up in big moments.” Certainly, that is no truer than with Lloyd, who famously scored game-winning goals in both the 2012 and 2008 Olympic finals for the USA to win gold medals.</p> \n<p>With Lloyd’s goal the difference, she credited a team that played with more freedom than they had yet in this Women’s World Cup.</p> \n<p>“When we defend like we did, pressing high, I think it just instinctually gives people the confidence to attack,” Lloyd said. “Jill and the coaching staff said, ‘Want want players to take players one-on-one, get to the end line and get forwards involved.’ Everyone just played freely out there.”</p> \n<p>The Americans went into the half scoreless, despite out-shooting China 11 to four, with three of their chances on frame, and nearly all of the shots looking close and dangerous.</p> \n<p>But six minutes after the break, the Americans found their breakthrough. Julie Johnston served one into the box and Lloyd rose up over the shoulders of forward Zhao Rong in the box to get a perfectly placed head on it, beating goalkeeper Wang Fei.</p> \n<p>“These are the moments that I live for,” Lloyd said after Friday’s quarter-final. “It’s just one of those things where you prepare for it mentally and physically. I knew that I wasn’t myself in the beginning games, but now I had the freedom to attack and do what I do best.”</p> \n<p>Ellis was forced to make some major adjustments to her usual line-up, with Lauren Holiday and Megan Rapinoe suspended due to yellow card accumulation. Ellis put Morgan Brian in Holiday’s spot and pulled a surprise, starting left back Kelley O’Hara as the right winger.</p> \n<p>Lloyd, who had played more of a box-to-box type of midfielder in previous games, was given license to push forward and attack while Brian sat in a defensive midfielder role.</p> \n<p>“I defended more than I’ve ever defended, but I was happy to play that role,” Brian said, adding that she was directed to play holding midfielder so Lloyd could attack. “That’s what our team needed.”</p> \n<p>As the Americans went into the locker room, the frustration was palpable, especially after having a golden opportunity to take the lead in just the second minute. Amy Rodriguez, who struggled in the final third in her first start of this tournament, went one-on-one with China’s goalkeeper and tried to chip it over Wang, but sent it badly wide.</p> \n<p>Most of the Americans’ best chances came in the first half as China crept into the game in the second half and eked out more possession.</p> \n<p>O’Hara had a powerful long-range shot sail just above the crossbar in the sixth minute. In the 21st minute, a Tobin Heath cross found O’Hara, whose diving header went just wide. Johnston also had a header go wide in the 31st minute.</p> \n<p>O’Hara got knocked in the face in the scrum of a corner kick and was subbed out with a bloody nose in the second half. After the match, she said she hoped it wasn’t broken and didn’t think so.</p> \n<p>Goalkeeper Hope Solo did make a two saves in the second half, but they were routine ones that didn’t test her much. The Americans, for their part, had four shots on goal and ended the night outshooting China 17-to-6.</p> \n<p>For China, despite the loss, it was their best finish in a World Cup since they fell to the Americans in the 1999 final. This was the first time China faced the USA in a World Cup since then, too.</p> \n<p>No 2-ranked USA next face No 1-ranked heavyweight Germany in Montreal. Germany beat France earlier in the day, slipping past on a close penalty kick shootout to settle a 1-1 score at full-time.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d1412f2a97a56bff795ef844c7d2fa9da9a966c5/36_0_2944_1765/2944.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1765,"width":2944,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jana Chytilova/Freestyle Photo/Getty Images","altText":"Carli Lloyd makes the breakthrough.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jana Chytilova/Freestyle Photo/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-27T01:40:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T05:00:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":103,"contributors":[{"name":"Caitlin Murray","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caitlin-murray"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women's World Cup 2015","Football","Sport","Women's football","USA women's football team","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"football/usa-womens-football-team","webTitle":"USA women's football team"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caitlin Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/caitlin-murray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/26/womens-world-cup-usa-china-carli-lloyd","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7vn","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/26/womens-world-cup-usa-china-carli-lloyd","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/26/womens-world-cup-usa-china-carli-lloyd"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d1412f2a97a56bff795ef844c7d2fa9da9a966c5/36_0_2944_1765/2944.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1765,"width":2944,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Carli Lloyd makes the breakthrough.

Whether they go out to dinner together is a different story …”</p> \n<p>There is a widely shared view in the game that a booking for two at San Remo for Messrs Federer and Djokovic is highly unlikely.

Is it good for tennis that they maintain this dignified respect that covers up for any antipathy?”</p> \n<p>As Djokovic’s coach, one would imagine Becker is speaking from at least an informed platform. It was, nonetheless, a real eyebrow lifter that rippled through the locker room all the way up to Federer, father of four and darling of millions, who thought Becker impertinent to make such a suggestion.</p> \n<p>As the draw dictates, it is a “row” that could be settled on court only in the final, as they are charging at each other from different sides of the draw.</p> \n<p>Murray, meanwhile, has much to distract him: an opening round match against Mikhail Kukushkin, the 58th-ranked Kazakh he has beaten twice, the last time for the loss of three games in two-and-a-bit sets before a retirement in the third round of the 2012 Australian Open.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/26/rafael-nadal-wimbledon-2015-injuries-beautiful\">Rafael Nadal in warrior mentality for Wimbledon: ‘I am very motivated’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The world No3, seeded third behind Djokovic and Federer, will never have arrived at Wimbledon in better shape, physically and mentally. It is a wonder, when he looks back, that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-2013-novak-djokovic\">he won the title in 2013</a> with a back held together by painkillers and bloody-mindedness. He grimaced through his triumph then; he allows himself the occasional smile now.</p> \n<p>“It was hard for a few reasons [after Ivan Lendl left his team in March last year]. Changing coaches is tough, but coming back from surgery I found hard as well.</p> \n<p>“My back still hurt after the surgery. I thought at the time: ‘You have the surgery and when you start again you might struggle for a little while but then you’re body would feel OK.’ For me, it wasn’t the case. My back still hurt and I was worried about that as well. When I won Wimbledon, it was great and that does make you happy.</p> \n<p>“But a lot of the time I was playing I was in pain. So I wasn’t enjoying practising. I wasn’t hating tennis, and I don’t know if resentful is the right word but, when I stepped on the court, it was causing me pain – and I wasn’t actually enjoying that.</p> \n<p>“Now, I love practising, love going in the gym, love training hard. For a while when I was having problems with my back, I wasn’t enjoying it.</p> \n<p>“Also, I was just getting a better perspective on things: that tennis isn’t the only thing. You don’t have to win every single week – because, if you go in with that mindset, you’re never happy. If you expect to win every week then, when you do win, well, that’s what you expected. Whereas if you just lower the expectations a little bit, it makes you enjoy the game a bit more.”</p> \n<p>A more philosophical Murray also looks a more dangerous one. He is in blinding form, carrying his new-found confidence on clay over to the grass in spectacular fashion at Queen’s last week, when he beat such a variety of styles on one day <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/andy-murray-viktor-troicki-queens\">in Viktor Stoicki </a>and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/andy-murray-kevin-anderson-queens-title\">then Kevin Anderson </a>to win his fourth Aegon Championship title that he was giving a masterclass across all the disciplines.</p> \n<p>Now, though, he steps up to the bigger stage. And there it is invariably a discussion between the Big Four, however slightly diminished that brand is. Is it changing irrevocably? “I wouldn’t say it’s quite the same as it was,” Murray says. “At different stages, people wanted to write [us off] ... apart from Novak – he hasn’t really had any injuries or dips in form.</p> \n<p>“Roger for a while [did], like the year he lost to Stakhovsky at Wimbledon, and when the US Open was over for him as well. Rafa, just now, a lot of people are saying he isn’t the same and he is not going to come back. I had the same thing last year as well.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jun/26/serena-williams-wimbledon-grand-slam\">Will Wimbledon be step or stumble on Serena Williams’ historic march? | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“There are more guys who can win now, for sure. It’s definitely a lot more open than what it was. But I don’t think that any one of the guys you mention are close to being done at the top level. But guys catch up.”</p> \n<p>In that context, was there any professional warmth directed towards Stan Wawrinka, one of the game’s nice guys, when he upset Djokovic to win the French Open? “I don’t know,” Murray says. “I hadn’t really thought about it that way. Maybe psychologically for the Tour it was important. I remember in Rome earlier in the year, they had a players’ draw outside the locker room and, before the tournament had even started, someone had just written Djokovic’s name in the winner’s space.</p> \n<p>“Stan winning in the final was a huge upset but also showed in those matches that Novak can be beaten. Granted, Stan played an incredible match, but it can be done.”</p> \n<p>There can be little doubt that Becker has ensured that one player as much as any of the young pretenders will be straining at the edge of his age‑refined talent to do it again if he gets the opportunity and take an eighth Wimbledon title.</p> \n<p><em>Performance training brand Under Armour supports Andy Murray.

If anything, the Spaniard, who has tumbled to 10th in the world shortly after his 29th birthday and is lightly regarded among many observers as a genuine threat to unseat Novak Djokovic here, appears to have left the battle smoke of Paris behind him with more equanimity than anyone could have imagined.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/26/rafael-nadal-wimbledon-2010-2014\">Rafael Nadal’s Wimbledon journey: from 2010 champion to three early exits</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Still, it has been a minor nightmare of a summer for Nadal, pre-eminent on clay yet losing five times on the European dirt, with Djokovic rubbing it in at Roland Garros in the quarter-finals. Does going through this sort of a slump renew his hunger or feed his anxiety, I wondered? “I have the best motivation: to be back where I was. And I’m gonna work for it.”</p> \n<p>He will, of course. Nadal’s career, even at its peak, has been about struggle, intensity, sweat – as opposed to the player alongside whom he has driven towards greatness, Roger Federer. The Swiss, in stark contrast, arrives here lightly and smiling at 33, with all the twins in tow, to make another quiet raid on his favourite tournament.</p> \n<p>During a break in the US Open a few years ago, American television showed slow-motion clips of just the feet of Nadal and Federer as they moved side to side along the baseline. Nadal, almost defying the slo-mo, was the quick-stepping boxer, all tightly sprung energy; the Swiss was a ballet dancer, the very picture of floating, effortless menace. Nadal seems to have to fight like that boxer every day; Federer is forced from his choreographed elegance only in extremis.</p> \n<p>As William Skidelsky observes in his eccentric, engaging love letter to Nadal’s Swiss opposite, <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/293296/s/federer-and-me/\" title=\"\">Federer and Me: a Story of Obsession</a>: “The Spaniard is sometimes compared to a capybara, the buck-toothed South American rodent but, while it’s true that there’s a striking visual resemblance, strategically he’s more of a boa constrictor: instead of swiftly dispatching his victims, he subjects them to a drawn-out asphyxiation.”</p> \n<p>Apart from the cruel metaphor, it is a notion with which Nadal would not violently disagree.</p> \n<p>“Everybody is different, yes,” he says. “I’m not sure about the word ‘talent’, because everything is a talent. He has a different talent to me.</p> \n<p>“It is obvious that he hits the ball easier than me, he serves better than me and he is able to do the things easier than what I do. So his talent is much better there.</p> \n<p>“But I have talent too – to be there. I have the talent to put one more ball inside. I have the talent to play with a good level a lot of hours in a row. That is what I did during my whole career. And I have the talent to not miss much, and to come back from very tough positions, to be in a defensive position and pass very quickly to an aggressive position. His style is completely different to mine. Probably that makes the rivalry special.”</p> \n<p>The only point at which they could engage for a 34th time would be in the semi-finals. It is unlikely, and a blow for nostalgics. If they do meet, it will be business not sentiment that informs their work. They are, as Andy Murray has said of his relationship with Djokovic, “professional friends”. And Nadal had not heard of Federer’s sceptical response last week to Boris Becker’s claim in his latest book that the leading players pretend too much to like each other, a feeling the German regarded as implausible.</p> \n<p>“I had not read that. My point of view is that what happens outside the court isn’t going to have a big impact on what’s going to happen on court.</p> \n<p>“But it is difficult to be very good friends, because at the end of the day, the best friends are the ones who know you since you were a kid. They are my real friends. At the same time, it is good to respect everyone, to have a good relationship, even if you are not best friends.</p> \n<p>“For me it is important to have a good relationship with the people you are going to be with every week on the Tour. It’s a bad feeling if you go in the locker room, look around you and you don’t have a good relationship with them. A lot of people, they see maybe another point of view: more drastic, more dramatic, that everybody is a rival. For me, tennis is very important but not the most important thing in life.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/tennis-zip/giv-21277Ieyk7vRIIlIS\" data-alt=\"Guardian graphics\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/tennis-zip/giv-21277Ieyk7vRIIlIS\">Guardian graphics</a> \n</figure> \n<p>On his return to Wimbledon, taking in the glorious greenness of it all, the mere playing of tennis, a sport he loves and is so good at, surely must seem like the best job in the world. Yet with glory and fame has come angst and suffering, the baggage of defeat and serial injury. With 14 majors in the bag and enough money to last several lifetimes, is it still worth it?</p> \n<p>“You compete every day. A lot of players on Tour have injuries, so that makes the sport tough … but at the same time beautiful.” This is warrior language. Nadal, perhaps in a Catholic way, embraces pain as the price for his gifts. Federer, meanwhile, has not had pain as a constant travelling companion. He has had the freedom to be an artist.</p> \n<p>“There are tougher things in life,” Nadal says of his calling, “and everybody on the ATP Tour knows we are very lucky people.”</p> \n<p>When a Madrid specialist told the Spanish teenager in 2004 that he had a deformed tarsal scaphoid bone on the bridge of his left foot and that he might never play again, he was shattered to the point of breakdown, according to his autobiography: “I’d lie for hours on the end on the sofa staring into space, or sit in the bathroom or on the stairs, weeping. I didn’t laugh, I&nbsp;didn’t smile, I didn’t want to talk. I&nbsp;lost all appetite for life.”</p> \n<p>That image of despair is hard to equate with the atomic energy he still brings to the court. He has done so over the years, however, with a built-up shoe that checked the original foot problem, transferring it to his knees, wrists and elbows and building a dark forest of vulnerable places in his muscled body, like the ones Federer finds when placing his spots on serve against him, shifting the point of doubt and hurt.</p> \n<p>“I had the past couple of years some dark periods of time [six months away from playing with a wrist injury, then an appendectomy]. People talk a lot about injuries in my career but from 2005 to 2011, the injuries that I had didn’t stop me for enough time to go out from the top positions of the rankings, so I feel good about that. Some players get more injuries than others. That’s part of our life. Some players are not lucky with that, lucky with other things. I had some bad moments, a lot of very good moments. If you put everything in balance, much more positive than bad. I&nbsp;am fine now.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99318da99b800ffeafe2f391943f23b3a681d91f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435330075086/982fb95f-36bb-4471-8e96-3df76ef95b2e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wimbledon 2008: Rafael Nadal with the Wimbledon men's singles trophy after defeating Roger Federer in an epic match\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wimbledon 2008: Rafael Nadal with the Wimbledon men’s singles trophy after defeating Roger Federer in an epic match.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For someone with a lucrative watch sponsorship, Nadal and time don’t always click. (This is our fourth attempt to talk in three months. Defeat in Monte Carlo nixed the first one. Then there was Paris, ditto but worse. And Queen’s&nbsp;…) But he is fiercely devoted to his training schedule and arrives on the players’ terrace glowing from another encouraging workout on the practice courts, accommodating but focused.</p> \n<p>He had arrived in London from Mallorca midweek and headed straight for the shops to stock up for the fortnight in his rented house. Anyone who spotted a former two-times champion at the All England Club roaming the shelves for cornflakes in Wimbledon that day might have thought they had walked in on a photoshoot, but Nadal likes to stay rooted. It has kept him humble, which is not easy if you’ve earned $73m in prize money over 14 years, alongside endorsements and other deals that placed him 22nd on the Forbes Magazine list of the world’s best paid athletes in the year ending this&nbsp;month.</p> \n<p>One detailed breakdown of his career earnings puts his net worth at about $125m.</p> \n<p>Addressing that privilege, Nadal has had a foundation for eight years, inspired by his mother, Ana Mar&iacute;a.</p> \n<p>“When I was a kid, my mam was always great helping people. I saw when I was young she was always to send money to different places for the kids. Talking with her, we decided to create a&nbsp;foundation.”</p> \n<p>They began in Anantapur in India, among the <em>dalits</em>, or untouchables, and spread later to Barcelona, Zaragoza and Andaluc&iacute;a. “We aren’t going to change much but if all the people who have a lucky, privileged life can help a little bit then that is a lot of help. My foundation tries to help kids at risk of exclusion from society.”</p> \n<p>Now he is taking the project home to Mallorca. “I feel very lucky all the things that I have, all the things that happen to me. So it’s just a small way to give back something. It’s a big project for me, with 25 tennis courts and places for the kids to live, with a school too, and a big gym, small football stadium, different sports, some indoor courts. It’s something that’s going to be part of my future, a lot of work. But I have the motivation. I love sport in general … And I love tennis.”</p> \n<p>Did he never get tired of tennis? He did say at the O<sub>2</sub> finals in 2011 – not one of his easiest campaigns – that he had “lost the passion” for it …</p> \n<p>“That was a good but at the same time a very tough season. I lost a lot of finals. I lost the final in Indian Wells, I lost the final in Miami, I lost the final in Madrid, I lost the final in Rome, I won Roland Garros, but I lost the final here, I lost the final of the US Open. So, yes, you’re right. At the end of the season, you lose a little bit intensity, you lose a&nbsp;little bit of passion for the game. But, mentally, I got it back. I played Davis Cup in Spain. We won the final – and I&nbsp;started 2012 very well.”</p> \n<p>So, was winning the spur to carrying on? “What drives me every day is the work. It is important to achieve goals, even if they are not big goals. You have to achieve the small objectives too. Winning? … In sport the victory is … ”</p> \n<p>Everything? “Ha! No, not everything. But it’s very, very important. People only remember the victories. Our sport is not a sport of losses. You can lose hundreds of times, but the people only gonna remember the victories.”</p> \n<p>But in some ways those who don’t win all the time do not have that pressure, no? He pauses. The right eyebrow goes north in sync with his closed mouth, as if dragged upward in wonder.</p> \n<p>“It is obvious that the pressure for the top players to win almost every single match is completely different for the players a little bit lower ranked. But, at the end of the day, everybody wants to win. Every match is very competitive.”</p> \n<p>Yet losing to Nick Kyrgios here in the fourth round last year must have left at least a small psychic bruise. Nadal remembers it as he remembers beating Federer the first time they met, in Miami in 2004 – and the young Spanish kid won.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfb631e60e0db544904498c5f9bbc215c5ba9903\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435330243444/d0a198ac-1cb5-4903-b366-c1ecf75b17f4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Australia's Nick Kyrgios celebrates winning a game against Rafael Nadal during their fourth round match at Wimbledon 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Australia’s Nick Kyrgios celebrates winning a game against Rafael Nadal during their fourth round match at Wimbledon 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Court/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Everything is a little bit easier when you are a kid. But all the moments of your career have that beautiful thing: your mentality changes. It is important to adapt your tennis, your mental condition, to those different moments.”</p> \n<p>What is it like, then, going out to play these other great players, week after week: there he is again, that pesky Djokovic? Is there not a history that builds up?</p> \n<p>“Yes, but at the same time … every moment in the year is different, every moment in your career is different. Every match depends on how [each player] arrives at that match.”</p> \n<p>How did he cope with losing in Paris, then?</p> \n<p>“It was less tough than in 2009 [when his parents separated and his tennis lurched this way and that]. I know that can happen – and it happened. I competed for one hour and 30 [minutes], and that is not enough to win against Novak. This season there have been more ups and downs, but the last couple of months I am playing better. And I intend to continue like this.</p> \n<p>“It is not easy: six months, nearly, without playing tennis last year, injury. I lost a few matches this year that I shouldn’t have. When that happens a few times, it affects your confidence. When you come back from injury, it is important to win those matches that you can win or lose, to bring your confidence again and to feel that you are strong again.”</p> \n<p>He runs through all his losses, in details with scores, and sighs as he says, “So there were a lot of matches that I should win: one week ago [against Alexandr Dolgopolov in the first round at Queen’s] 4-3 and serving with break in the first … If you are able to win these matches, the year changes and you have the chances to be in a better position in the ranking. You accept that, and when you change that, you are there again.”</p> \n<p>So, can Wimbledon, the place of some of his finest hours and lowest moments, inspire him to halt the slide?</p> \n<p>“On grass, every match is dangerous, every player is dangerous. If you play well, if you find the real rhythm, you can have a lot of fun. It is a feeling I have had a few years here in my career. It is very special. Obviously it is more difficult not being seeded top four. I am seed 10 because I didn’t play well enough and because I was out injured for six months last year. I am where I deserve to be now, and I hoped to be in a higher position back here. I am going to work for that, but what gonna happen gonna happen. I need to do it my way.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435329697237/Rafael-Nadal-at-Queens-Cl-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rafael Nadal at Queen's Club in London.

But this preamble comes to you at something close to what might once have been called “chucking out time” here in London, so a good evening it must be.</p> \n<p>And what an evening we have in store! It’s Argentina v Colombia for a place in the Copa America semi-finals, and it couldn’t be set up more tantalisingly.</p> \n<p>To recap, <strong>Argentina</strong> got this far by winning group B with the proverbial Minimum Of Fuss. They began by drawing against Paraguay, but then a lot of people do that; then a Sergio Aguero header saw off their nearest and dearest neighbours, Uruguay; next, Gonzalo Higuain’s early goal was enough to beat Caribbean special guests Jamaica. Has it been convincing? Not really, and we’re yet to see very much of Lionel Messi (although in one of the first things ever to have happened on a football pitch<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/lionel-messi-selfie-deshorn-brown-copa-america\"> he’s been in on some hot selfie action</a>), but it’s been comfortable enough and you sense that Gerardo Martino’s side is – much as under Alejandro Sabella at the World Cup last year – equipped with the matchwinners to go a long way even if it doesn’t really sparkle.</p> \n<p>And what of the <strong>Colombians</strong>? All counter-attacking verve and James Rodriguez and gung-ho intent and a bit more James Rodriguez last summer, they haven’t found their rhythm yet. They have, though, beaten Brazil 1-0 – which was the decisive result for them as, losing 1-0 to Venezuela and drawing 0-0 with Peru, they completely failed to shine otherwise. They went through as the second-best of the three third-placed teams, and can probably count themselves a bit lucky.</p> \n<p>The big question tonight will be <strong>“Does Rademel Falcao play?”</strong> Many would, reluctantly, rather that he didn’t. The Colombia captain has completely failed to get into gear so far, in common with his domestic season, and seems to have been cramping their speedy, rapier-sharp style somewhat – perhaps restricting James from feeding through some of his deft little through balls, too. Could – should – we see Carlos Bacca up top?</p> \n<p>Join me for this one (kick-off: 00.30 UK time.

It is easy, perhaps, to make such an appeal before a game against Brazil. Colombia won that, but after the draw with Peru, the frustration was back and reflected in a bleak sense of realism. “We played badly again,” he said. “When you lose you have to be self-critical and we have to know that if nothing happens we have to take responsibility.”</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-558dd61ce4b0c9bda8d8a7a2","title":"Hearing that Radamel Falcao has indeed been dropped","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:46:14Z","body":"<p>I’ll get the teams in full to you as soon as possible...</p>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-558dd681e4b0c9bda8d8a7a4","title":"Tonight's teams","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:49:47Z","body":"<p><strong>Argentina:</strong> Romero; Zabaleta, Garay, Otamendi, Rojo; Pastore, Mascherano, Biglia; Messi, Ag&uuml;ero, Di Mar&iacute;a.</p> \n<p><strong>Colombia:</strong> Ospina; Z&uacute;&ntilde;iga, Zapata, Murillo, Arias; Cuadrado, Mej&iacute;a, Ibarbo, James; Jackson, Guti&eacute;rrez.</p> \n<p>There you have it.

It’s pathetic for professionals to be sent straight to penalties like they were 10 year olds. But it’s the same in the Colombian domestic game, and last year during the World Cup the commentators were proclaiming the unfairness of some games going to extra time as “players looked tired”. Last week the team I play sub goalie for (it’s a good position for a hangover) was in a very exciting final we drew 1-1 only to be unceremoniously knocked out on penalties when we would have definitely been stronger over 120 minutes. It’s as though they think playing with a bit of cramp is somehow LESS of a lottery than penalties for gawd sake!!

But this preamble comes to you at something close to what might once have been called “chucking out time” here in London, so a good evening it must be.</p> \n<p>And what an evening we have in store! It’s Argentina v Colombia for a place in the Copa America semi-finals, and it couldn’t be set up more tantalisingly.</p> \n<p>To recap, <strong>Argentina</strong> got this far by winning group B with the proverbial Minimum Of Fuss. They began by drawing against Paraguay, but then a lot of people do that; then a Sergio Aguero header saw off their nearest and dearest neighbours, Uruguay; next, Gonzalo Higuain’s early goal was enough to beat Caribbean special guests Jamaica. Has it been convincing? Not really, and we’re yet to see very much of Lionel Messi (although in one of the first things ever to have happened on a football pitch<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/lionel-messi-selfie-deshorn-brown-copa-america\"> he’s been in on some hot selfie action</a>), but it’s been comfortable enough and you sense that Gerardo Martino’s side is – much as under Alejandro Sabella at the World Cup last year – equipped with the matchwinners to go a long way even if it doesn’t really sparkle.</p> \n<p>And what of the <strong>Colombians</strong>? All counter-attacking verve and James Rodriguez and gung-ho intent and a bit more James Rodriguez last summer, they haven’t found their rhythm yet. They have, though, beaten Brazil 1-0 – which was the decisive result for them as, losing 1-0 to Venezuela and drawing 0-0 with Peru, they completely failed to shine otherwise. They went through as the second-best of the three third-placed teams, and can probably count themselves a bit lucky.</p> \n<p>The big question tonight will be <strong>“Does Rademel Falcao play?”</strong> Many would, reluctantly, rather that he didn’t. The Colombia captain has completely failed to get into gear so far, in common with his domestic season, and seems to have been cramping their speedy, rapier-sharp style somewhat – perhaps restricting James from feeding through some of his deft little through balls, too. Could – should – we see Carlos Bacca up top?</p> \n<p>Join me for this one (kick-off: 00.30 UK time.

But Farah said he felt he had “to believe” in his coach’s impassioned<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/alberto-salazar-issues-denial-doping-statement\">12,000-word response</a> to allegations made by the BBC and the US news website ProPublica earlier this month and would continue to work with him.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/26/galen-rupp-alberto-salazar-eugene\">Galen Rupp and Alberto Salazar emerge to applause and scepticism in Eugene</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a statement Farah said: “Following all the speculation I want to make it clear where I stand. Although it’s been a difficult time, I asked Alberto to respond to the allegations made against him and he has now done so in full.</p> \n<p>“As someone I’ve worked with for many years, I feel I have to believe in Alberto and the evidence he has provided. Based on that evidence, I will continue to work with him and hope now that I can focus on what I do best – training hard to win medals for my country.”</p> \n<p>Salazar, meanwhile, has been in Eugene in Oregon where he watched Farah’s training partner Galen Rupp – who the BBC has accused of taking testosterone when he was a 16-year-old – win the 10,000m at the US trials for the seventh consecutive year.</p> \n<p>Speaking in public for the first time since the Panorama documentary, Salazar said he was “feeling good” despite the allegations swimming around him and confirmed that Barry Fudge, the head of endurance for British Athletics, was carrying out his instructions while Farah trains in Font–Romeu in France. “I speak to Barry every day,” Salazar added.</p> \n<p>However he ruled out legal action against the BBC and ProPublica, adding: “I’m not a vindictive person.” Instead he insisted he wanted to return his focus to his athletes. “It’s good to get back to racing,” he added. “The last couple of months have been tough. When you’re accused of horrible stuff, and you know you’re innocent, that’s a lot of stress. After getting my statement out, I feel much better.”</p> \n<p>There is no suggestion that Farah has done anything wrong since joining up with Salazar in 2011. But he has inevitably been drawn into the whirlpool of allegations surrounding his coach and training partner Rupp.</p> \n<p>Last week Farah insisted he had never taken performance-enhancing drugs and said his two missed tests before London 2012 were the only ones of his career. It is understood by the Guardian that Farah told anti-doping chiefs he was asleep when he failed to hear the doorbell during his second missed test in 2011.</p> \n<p>In a careful worded statement, UK Athletics said it “noted and respected” Farah’s decision. UK Athletics’ CEO Niels de Vos added: “As is normal at this time of the year, Mo is currently training at altitude under the guidance of British Athletics as he prepares for the August defence of his world titles in Beijing.</p> \n<p>“ As has always been the case, we will continue to take responsibility for all nutritional, medical and sport science elements of Mo Farah’s training regime.”</p> \n<p>Farah will return to the track for the first time since the allegations were made when he races over 5,000m in the Diamond League meeting in Lausanne on 9 July. He will then run the 1500m in Monaco on 17 July as he builds up to August’s world championships in Beijing.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435328841292/Athletics---Mo-Farah-File-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Martin Rickett/PA","altText":"Mo Farah has said he will continue to work with coach Alberto Salazar, left.

Alberto Salazar gave Galen Rupp testosterone when he was 16</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Steve Magness, an assistant coach at the Nike Oregon Project, told Panorama and ProPublica that he was in Salazar’s office when the reports showing athletes’ blood levels were put on his desk. “Under one of Galen’s it had ‘currently on testosterone and prednisone medication’ and when I saw that I kind of jumped backwards,” Magness said. “Testosterone is obviously banned and everyone knew that. It was all the way back in high school – and that was incredibly shocking. I actually took a picture of it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-defence-doctor-magness-emails\">Alberto Salazar’s defence under strain as witnesses dispute coach’s version of events</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>In his open letter, Salazar claimed Rupp was taking a natural and legal testosterone supplement – possibly Testaboost, Alpha Male or ZMA – that was incorrectly recorded. “My clear recollection is that when [Magness] showed it to me, I stated that the entry was ‘crazy’ as Galen had never taken testosterone. I then stated that Galen, as a 16-year-old kid, must have misspoken about the supplements he was taking. I told Magness to take it back to the lab and have them straighten things out. I didn’t think much of it afterwards since I knew it was a mistake and because Magness never mentioned it again.” Both Salazar and Rupp strenuously deny the athlete took testosterone.</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Photographic evidence exists of the reports, so it comes down to whether it was incorrectly recorded. Meanwhile Magness has responded, saying: “I came to my superior, Salazar, and asked for answers. It would have been a simple clarification to make at the time for him to contact Dr Loren Myhre [the Nike lab’s then head physiologist, who died in 2012], someone who he had worked with for at least a decade, to clear up the confusion. If I saw an official medical chart naming one of my athletes being on testosterone, I think it’s any normal person’s reaction to get to the bottom of it.”</p> \n<h2><strong>2. Rupp used prednisone, a powerful asthma drug banned in competition, aged 16</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>The Panorama presenter Mark Daly spoke to Stuart Eagon, a former running colleague of Rupp, who told him of an incident in 2003 involving prednisone, which can block pain and enhance oxygen consumption and is prohibited by the World Anti-Doping Agency in competition. “We were going on our morning run and Alberto said to Galen: ‘Have you taken your prednisone yet this morning?’” said Eagon. Daly added: “I have heard from various sources that Rupp has used prednisone regularly, but he has asthma and allergies, which could account for its use.”</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>An emphatic denial. “The claims that Galen has been on prednisone continuously since he was 15 are absolutely false. The BBC and ProPublica ‘reporters’ were informed that these allegations were completely false, and they should not have printed them. Printing false statements to harm Galen is irresponsible journalism that damaged an innocent athlete’s reputation – Galen has never taken prednisone for a competitive advantage.” Rupp has always denied taking any banned substances.</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Salazar appears to have strong evidence that Rupp was not taking prednisone regularly. However as David Epstein, the ProPublica reporter who worked closely with Panorama, points out, that was not the claim. “The BBC published a document showing that Rupp had apparently taken prednisone during one time period when he was 16. The story did not report allegations of continuous use nor cite the age 15.”</p> \n<h2><strong>3. Testosterone (AndroGel) was found at a Nike Oregon Project training camp</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Panorama spoke to John Stiner, a massage therapist who worked for Salazar in 2008, who said that Salazar told him he was using AndroGel – a banned steroid – for his heart. “He said to me: ‘I don’t want you to get the wrong idea.’ And I said: ‘OK.’ I was really unsure what he meant and he goes: ‘There’s a tube of AndroGel in the bedroom and it’s under some clothing.’ He said: ‘It’s for my heart, it’s all fucked up.’” The BBC said that using testosterone gel could actually make a heart problem worse.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>He accepts that he uses testosterone but says he never told Stiner it was for his heart and has never given it to his athletes. “My excessive training as an athlete did extensive damage to my body,” he said. “One of the lingering negative effects from which I still suffer today is hypogonadism with significant symptoms, including multiple low testosterone serum levels. There is no question that I have a valid justification for my possession of AndroGel as defined by the Wada code. I have never given AndroGel to any of my athletes.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>With broad agreement that Salazar was on testosterone. However Stiner insists he was right to say Salazar said it was for his heart. “I told 100% the truth,” he told ProPublica. “I’ll take 20 lie detector tests. Of course he said I’m lying.” The BBC says Salazar did not respond to questions sent regarding the reason he would be prescribed testosterone that were sent in early May.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. Salazar brought assorted vials and needles to a training camp</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Following the original Panorama and ProPublica revelations, Stiner also told the Daily Mail that he found vials in the fridge labelled “allergy one” and “allergy two” and a bag of unused hypodermic needles in the bathroom of one of the apartments the Nike Oregon Project rented while in Utah in 2008. Meanwhile the Mail also reported that Magness had also made allegations to the US Anti-Doping Agency (Usada), claiming he found an unmarked vial in France that belonged to Rupp.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>That these vials were simply allergy medicine for Rupp. “Galen has been receiving allergy immunotherapy vaccine injections since approximately 2004. His allergy specialists at the Allergy Clinic in Portland have specially mixed two vaccines for him. Vaccine A: Allergens &amp; Molds contains the following extracts: Cat, Dog, Dust Mites and two types of Molds. Vaccine B: Pollens contains: Mixed Grasses, Ragweeds, and 3 different Weeds common in the Pacific Northwest. Galen must receive weekly injections to help control his allergies and his asthma. All documents related to these medicines and Galen’s treatment for his allergies were provided to Usada in 2013. There is no issue here.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Salazar’s response is convincing – although it is slightly odd Magness was sent emails from Salazar and Rupp requesting the return of “Galen’s allergy serum” from France given such medicine appeared to be used so frequently.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Salazar tried to get a therapeutic use exemption (TUE) certificate for Rupp at the 2011 world championships</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Kara Goucher, the 10,000m bronze medallist at the 2007 world championships, told Panorama and ProPublica that Salazar had coached Rupp to try to get a TUE for an intravenous drip before the 2011 World Championships. Under Wada rules, such drips are prohibited and anyone caught manipulating the TUE process to get one would be liable for a ban.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>That the allegation is false – and he has documentation that backs him up. “As the US team doctor has confirmed, at no time did I request the US team doctor to give Galen an IV or saline drip while he was in Daegu in 2011,” he said. “Galen did not receive any vitamin shots in Daegu. The US team doctors did not have any needles and UK Athletics doctors could not treat a US athlete.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Again at a stalemate. ProPublica says other people back up Goucher’s claim but Salazar is adamant it wasn’t the case.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-statement-nike-steve-magness-mo-farah-bbc-panorama-claims\">Alberto Salazar rebuttal: starting pistol for a race heading for the courts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>6. Rupp said he was tired after the 2011 World Championships in South Korea yet ran a personal best soon afterwards</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>The BBC quoted Goucher, who appeared to suggest Rupp’s improvement between races was suspicious. “I had a conversation with Galen in 2011 and he told me how tired he was and how he was so excited to have the season be over,” she said. “You don’t get to the end of a long year burnt out and take two weeks off and come out and run the best race of your life, that’s not how it works.”</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>As Salazar points out, when Rupp ran in Daegu it was 80F (26.6C) and the heat wouldn’t have suited him because he weighed more than other athletes, while in Brussels – where Rupp broke the US record – it was only 59F (15C). He added: “It should be noted that even while making these false allegations against me, neither Kara nor Adam ever claim that I violated the Wada code or IAAF anti-doping rules.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Another impasse. Salazar claims Rupp’s improvement in 2011 was no surprise because he had steadily got better throughout his career. Others who have worked at the Nike Oregon Project have told the Guardian that they did not expect Rupp to improve as much as he did in 2011 and 2012.</p> \n<h2><strong>7. Salazar wanted to give Goucher a prescription thyroid drug because she had put on weight after giving birth</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Goucher claimed to Panorama that Salazar had tried to get her to take the prescription thyroid drug Cytomel, saying: “Alberto was always unhappy about my weight after I had Colt, like it was almost as if I didn’t have a child, I’d just like gained 30 pounds. He said: ‘You need to just take some Cytomel.’ Maybe four or five days goes by and Alberto brought me this prescription drug that I didn’t have a prescription for. It has Alberto’s writing on it clear as day.”</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>Salazar has published a trail of email correspondence between the pair which appears to suggest that he did not want Goucher to lose weight more quickly. “I was thrilled with Kara’s weight, body composition and fitness in 2011,” he added. However, he did admit: “There was one time when I gave Kara Cytomel. It was in August 2011 in Daegu, South Korea. I did so after being expressly directed to do so by Kara’s endocrinologist, Dr Brown.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Salazar’s evidence appears to back up his claims regarding weight loss. However ProPublica has since spoken to Dr Brown, who says that while he could not discuss individual patients: “I would never, ever give somebody Cytomel for weight loss, ever.” As to the bottle, Brown said: “I don’t write on frickin’ bottles, and if it was mine, you wouldn’t be able to read it.”</p> \n<h2><strong>8. Salazar was happy for his athletes to take banned testosterone medication</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Panorama spoke to another unnamed runner, who worked with Salazar for several years, who said that in 2007 he was feeling run down and went to see Dr Loren Myhre, who “suggested that I go and see an endocrinologist that Alberto and most of the athletes work with, to get testosterone and thyroid. He said: ‘This is what Alberto does. You’ll feel better and you’ll be able to train better,’ and so then I said: ‘Well, isn’t that cheating?’ And he goes: ‘Well no, Alberto does it.’ I did mention something about being, like: ‘Wouldn’t it test positive?’ He said: ‘No, no, no. We’ll get you into the normal range.’”</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>A fierce and emphatic denial. Salazar called these allegations “a remarkable display of irresponsible journalism” adding: “I do not know of a single instance where Dr Myhre ever recommended that an athlete that I was coaching take testosterone whether with a prescription or otherwise.” He added: “To claim ‘That is what Alberto does’ is completely false. It is not what I did then; it’s not what I do now and it’s not what I have ever done.”</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Another impasse. Dr Myhre passed away in 2012, which makes it particularly hard to prove or refute the allegations.</p> \n<h2><strong>9. Rupp received unspecified pills in a paperback thriller</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Magness and Rupp were in D&uuml;sseldorf when Rupp told him he wasn’t feeling well. Magness called Salazar, who he says told him to expect a package. Two days later, a box arrived at his hotel room. Inside it he found a paperback thriller. Confused, he flipped it open. A section of the pages had been hollowed out to form a compartment into which two pills were taped. “At that point,” Magness says, “my mind was like: ‘This is stuff you see in movies, this is extremely strange.’” He handed the pills to Rupp, who he says promptly swallowed them and laughed off the clandestine packaging as typical Salazar antics.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>Neither Salazar nor Rupp responded to Epstein’s original questions about the hollowed-out book containing pills. But in his statement Salazar says: “Allegations around prednisone in D&uuml;sseldorf are false, and Steve Magness is fully aware of what occurred because he was involved.” Salazar also quotes another time, in Birmingham, where he used unusual packaging via mail. “Noting my peculiar packaging, Galen wrote: ‘You went all Shawshank Redemption on that book and nasal spray. I loved it!!!’</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-case-expert-says-athletes-are-particularly-asthma-prone\">Alberto Salazar case: Expert says athletes are particularly asthma-prone</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>Depending on your point of view, this either shows that Salazar – for all his reputation for being intense and win-at-all costs – is a secret practical joker, or needs to explain why he didn’t send medicine to his athlete in the normal way.</p> \n<h2><strong>10. Salazar tested testosterone on his son, Alex, in a laboratory to see the levels needed to evade tests</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>What was alleged </strong>Salazar’s son was involved in tests to see how much testosterone cream would trigger a positive test. According to Magness, Alex told him they were worried that someone could rub some cream on one of their athletes after a race. Magness said he believed that explanation to be “ludicrous” – and that they were instead trying to figure out how to cheat.</p> \n<p><strong>Salazar’s response </strong>Salazar does not mention Alex in his response but does say he “let his paranoia get the best of him” when he asked Dr Brown to “set up an experiment” to see whether it was possible for an athlete to be sabotaged by someone rubbing testosterone on them. Salazar says that when Justin Gatlin, the 100m runner, blamed his positive test for exogenous testosterone on being sabotaged by his massage therapist, Chris Whetstine, a claim Whetstine denied. Salazar claims he was worried the same thing might happen to Rupp – especially when Whetstine rubbed Rupp’s shoulders in 2009.</p> \n<p><strong>Where this leaves us </strong>ProPublica have since spoken to Brown, who said he did not prescribe a controlled substance for Salazar’s son or other research subjects as part of an experiment. “No, absolutely not,” Brown said. “I didn’t do that, and would not do that.” He said that he was merely advising Salazar on how to conduct research on potential sabotage “in a hypothetical situation”. He said that Salazar’s exploration of potential testosterone sabotage was admirable.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435264278597/Alberto-Salazar-in-1984-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar, left, running at the US Olympic marathon trials in 1984.

All we’re asking is for people to play their natural way.</p> \n<p>“We talked at the start of the summer about showcasing our talent and playing the way you want to play and having that belief and confidence backed by the support staff and other players.

Few people at Southampton expect him to stay this time, and a bid of around &pound;25m would be difficult to turn down.</p> \n<p>Mauricio Pochettino, who worked with Schneiderlin at Southampton before becoming manager at White Hart Lane in May last year, remains a big admirer but Spurs claim that they have not moved for the 25-year-old this summer.</p> \n<p>Cech is poised to become only the sixth player to switch directly from Chelsea to Arsenal – following Bill Dickson (1953), George Graham (1966), William Gallas (2006), Lassana Diarra (2007) and Yossi Benayoun (loan, 2011).
