No doubt, home sentiment has coloured early investment but those markets are probably not far wrong.</p> \n<p>On their respective showings on Wednesday, Federer might be the fresher and more relaxed, coming off a relatively untroubled win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/roger-federer-victory-wimbledon-semi-finals-gilles-simon\" title=\"\">Gilles Simon</a> that detained him an hour and 35 minutes, to add to the six hours 16 minutes it took him to get through his first four matches without dropping a set.</p> \n<p>Murray, looked more stressed beating the versatile and dangerous young Canadian Vasek Pospisil 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 in two hours 12 minutes, to go with the eight hours and 50 minutes of his journey to the quarters. But neither of them has been seriously in danger at any time over the first nine days.</p> \n<p>Murray, in his 150th victory in a grand slam match, moved into the semi-finals for the sixth time in 10 visits – excellence of the highest order – but he will come away from his victory (which was interrupted twice for rain and finished under the roof even though there was not a drop of rain to be seen for miles) eager to restore his energy levels over the concluding stages of his favourite tournament.</p> \n<p>The soreness in Murray’s right shoulder that struck during his edgy win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/04/andy-murray-andreas-seppi-victory-wimbledon\" title=\"\">Andreas Seppi</a> last week and flared when he beat <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/andy-murray-wimbledon-2015-ivo-karlovic\" title=\"\">Ivo Karlovic on Monday</a> might have been the root cause of some under-powered hitting from hand and off the ground, although there is no cause yet for major concern.</p> \n<p>If Murray was striving for full force, Pospisil had his own physical burden, coming into his first grand slam quarter-final after three five-setters, including a tough win over the Londoner James Ward, not to mention his three hours and 39 minutes doubles defeat with Jack Sock against Andy’s brother, Jamie, and the Australian John Peers.</p> \n<p>If Pospisil did not come to Centre Court a sitting Canadian duck, he was certainly a tired moose.</p> \n<p>Just before the ground staff scurried on to court at 1.25pm to draw the covers over the turf after 13 minutes’ tennis, Murray (whose mood is always in sync with the elements) double-faulted in probably the most bizarre fashion of his interesting career, landing the ball in the middle of the wrong box. Nevertheless, he hit a 114mph boomer down the middle to hold for 3-1, regrouped and took the set.</p> \n<p>When they resumed at 2.03pm, the skies had brightened, as had Pospisil’s spirits. He played his best tennis in this period before the second break for rain.</p> \n<p>At 2.57pm, the umbrellas went up and the ground staff again rushed to the covers. They returned under the roof, windless and away from the now warm and pleasant sunshine bathing the rest of Wimbledon.</p> \n<p>The club’s thinking was that more rain was forecast, so this was the time to go inside. Unfortunately for them, it did not rain for the rest of the match.</p> \n<p>Pospisil struggled to hold his level under a fresh burst of pressure in longer rallies – and he was warned for slow serving as he gathered his composure in the 10th game of the second set.</p> \n<p>Murray won a deft net battle for break point, taking his chance with an astonishingly difficult backhand crosscourt winner that left the Canadian sprawled on the grass.</p> \n<p>“The first set, he played a great game to break,” Pospisil said. “Also, maybe my energy was a little bit low – first time in the quarter-finals of a grand slam. After the first rain delay, that first set and a half, I was pretty comfortable. I felt like I was dictating play. But I missed a couple balls when I shouldn’t have.”</p> \n<p>He also did well to keep his composure during two time violations that arrived at the worst moment for him. Afterwards he vented his frustration. “A lot of times these umpires, they seem to just want to be seen. I don’t know why they do it at a time like that. How many times do you see the top guys go more than [30 seconds] and they don’t get any violation, especially when it’s important moments? But I go out there and I get a time violation. I was right about to serve the ball. If he would have waited one second longer, I would have served.</p> \n<p>“I don’t agree with that time when he did it. Maybe the second one, yes, but not at five-all, 30-all. That was ridiculous, in my opinion. But I don’t think it affected me mentally very much.”</p> \n<p>The argument was resolved in the proper way in the third set, with Pospisil, his legs slowing, still fighting hard and Murray chipping away at his resolve. The Canadian saved three break points in the first three games, hung in for 2-2 and also 4-4.</p> \n<p>In the ninth game he was penalised on his serve for a second perceived delay on delivery, a decision that the partisan home crowd did not greet warmly. Murray got a fifth break point, Pospisil returned between his legs and was applauded but Murray broke with a clinical backhand and served for the match.</p> \n<p>Pospisil left it until the death but finally got a break point then saved match point, before Murray served through deuce twice to finish the job with a final whipped forehand.</p> \n<p>It was the sort of hard-earned win that will either harden Murray up for what will be an altogether different examination of his endurance and skills on Friday or eat into his self-belief. The former would seem more likely.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/8/1436370856795/andy-murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray gives his all during victory over Vasek Pospisil.

But Gasquet, who has flattered to deceive so many times, won the fourth and, though broken when serving for the match at 5-3 in the decider, he broke in the 20th game to advance to the semi-finals. His reward is a match with the world No1 and defending champion, Novak Djokovic.</p> \n<p>“It was very tough when I served at 5-3 and I got frustrated after that, but I tried to fight, fight and the last game was incredible,” Gasquet said. “It’s a great match for me. It would have been really difficult for me to lose after being up 5-3. It’s wonderful for me.”</p> \n<p>This was the battle of the backhands, the pair owning the two best one-handers in the business, and it did not disappoint, with some brilliant shots, even if the No4 seed took time to find his feet.</p> \n<p>Gasquet began brightly but from the moment he double-faulted to lose the second set it seemed unlikely he would make it through. Mental strength, at the very biggest moments, and an occasionally shaky serve, have been the biggest deficiencies in the Frenchman’s game but after Wawrinka won the third set he fought back superbly to take the fourth. Then in the fifth he bounced back after being broken at 5-3 and saved a break point in the 19th game before breaking in the next for victory.</p> \n<p>Some of the play from both verged on the outrageous, even more so in a match played in a brisk wind on No1 Court where it can swirl more than in the relatively confined surroundings of Centre Court.</p> \n<p>In the first set Wawrinka was guilty of hanging back too much and Gasquet, a semi-finalist in 2007, was able to dictate, breaking for 4-3 and then serving out to move ahead. In the second, despite a worrying moment when he flexed his right shoulder, Wawrinka began to take command and when Gasquet needed to be strong – serving at 4-5 – he failed. His first double-fault of the match handed the Swiss a set point and though it was saved, his second double-fault gave Wawrinka the set.</p> \n<p>In the third Wawrinka began to cut loose, stepping into the court and ripping winners almost at will, with one break doing the job. But in the fourth Gasquet continued to go for his shots, always looking to make something happen. Wawrinka’s serve got him out of trouble a few times but his first double-fault gifted Gasquet the break and the set.</p> \n<p>By this stage, Gasquet was reapplying the overgrip to his racket handle at every change of ends, his nerves there for everyone to see. His mental solidity has never been a strength but at 5-3, 30-15, he looked on course for victory only for two backhand errors to cost him dear.</p> \n<p>The Frenchman showed great resolve, though, saving a break point at 9-9 with a big first serve. That was Wawrinka’s last opportunity, it proved, as Gasquet forced three match points in the next game and took the third of them to seal victory when Wawrinka sent a backhand long.</p> \n<p>Djokovic eased into the last four and then anticipated a tough test against Gasquet, praising the Frenchman’s fitness for his strong form. “It’s a great effort from Richard to win against Stan, who is in a terrific form, and five sets,” said the world No1. “The biggest difference with Richard now, maybe comparing to the last couple of years, is his fitness. He has improved a lot. I heard he worked hard to get himself really fit and ready to go the distance, and it’s paying off.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436388059358/Richard-Gasquet-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Richard Gasquet celebrates after beating Stan Wawrinka after five gruelling sets in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon.

Of these Steve Smith will get his chance perhaps on the second day to show his remarkable progress from perceived clown to the top-ranked batsman in the world. For now, though, the rise and rise of Joe Root, the epitome of youthful exuberance, continues. Root, not yet 25 years old, is having the time of his life, in that state, unencumbered by theory and over-analysis, where batting becomes so easy that it must be hard for him to comprehend how difficult it can be for others.</p> \n<p>Dropped by Brad Haddin behind the wicket from the second ball he faced from Mitchell Starc, he made a sublime century, his second against Australia and the seventh of his Test career, that pulled England away from a tricky situation at 43 for three, and he was not to be dismissed until Starc returned for his sixth spell and with his first ball, angled across, had him well caught low down at first slip by Shane Watson.</p> \n<p>By then, though, he had made 134, hitting 17 fours in the process, most of them sweetly through extra cover. There was assistance. Gary Ballance, whose idiosyncratic technique will have been scrutinised by Australia and no doubt left them wondering how precisely he has managed to average in the mid-50s, weathered the early storm that saw the loss of Adam Lyth, in the second over of the day, and then Alastair Cook and Ian Bell immediately after the first drinks break.</p> \n<p>Ballance was to make 61 in three and three quarter hours during which he scarcely made a mistake until he was lbw to a full ball from the persevering Josh Hazlewood. But by then he and Root had added 153 for the fourth wicket, effectively wiping out the earlier setback.</p> \n<p>Later Ben Stokes arrived to play with freedom once again, making 52, with seven fours and two sixes, one a top-edged hook over fine-leg and the other straight from Lyons, before he was bowled by a beauty from Starc that pitched around middle and took off stump. “Sssh” Starc mimed, finger to lips, as Stokes grumped his way off: sound advice.</p> \n<p>These really are remarkable times for Root. From the start of play he had sat on the dressing room balcony, grinning away at the lark of it all. He watched as Lyth edged Hazlewood’s third ball low to David Warner in the gully, who took a sharp catch well – a good delivery that swung into the left-hander, prompting him to look legside, but then held off the pitch. Soon after, Cook, looking to be positive against Nathan Lyon’s offspin but unable to get away any of the 13 previous deliveries from him, looked for his favourite cut and edged behind.</p> \n<p>One run later and Bell all but had his feet knocked from beneath him by Starc’s yorker and was lbw, thus continuing a sorry run of Test match scores – 11, 1, 0, 0, 1, 29, 12, 1 and now 1 again – since he made 143 against West Indies in the first Test in Antigua back in April.</p> \n<p>If it was a ticklish first hour for England, who won the toss and had no hesitation in batting despite some overcast conditions and the occasional squally shower, then those who had taken their seats early expecting to see some fire and brimstone from the Australian pace attack would have been disappointed. Local knowledge had suggested that county pitches had been slow this season and this, devoid of grass, looks to be no exception.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/wales-ashes-first-test-ecb-glamorgan-england-australia\">Wales puts on a woolly welcome as ECB tries to feed the Glamorgan fire | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Haddin stood a long way back for Starc’s opening over, only to find two deliveries bouncing before they reached him. If the ball nibbled around a little and swung too, potentially taking the pitch out of the equation, then it would still have signalled a tough day for the bowlers, who could see the law of diminishing returns: the harder they flogged the ball into the pitch, the slower it came off it.</p> \n<p>It may suit skiddy bowlers more. Under the circumstances the Australians stuck to their task handsomely, the reward of three wickets apiece to Hazlewood and particularly Starc more than well-earned. The scoring rate throughout the day was admirable –in excess of four runs per over – but turgid, emasculating surfaces such as this do Test cricket few favours.</p> \n<p>By the close England had reached 343 for seven, a total with which they should be content but not more than that. The wicket of Jos Buttler, for 27, shortly before the close, as he hit Hazlewood tamely to mid-on, meant that Australia may well be the more satisfied of the two teams.</p> \n<p>The manner in which Starc and Hazlewood were able to adjust their length to the conditions, bowling fuller than they might habitually be used to, and risking being driven in the process, was exemplary and the ball was given the opportunity to swing as a result. Jimmy Anderson, in particular, will see encouragement in this but it promises to be just as hard for the England bowlers as their Australian counterparts.</p> \n<p>As it is, it will be down to Moeen Ali, who has batted calmly for his 26, and Stuart Broad to try to get England up to 400 and beyond.

Both times he picked out the man placed short.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/england-australia-first-test-ashes-match-report\">Joe Root rides luck before sparking England revival against Australia</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Like granddad attempting a knee-slide on the dance floor of a wedding, the left-hander’s attempts to hit Lyon out of the attack early were in keeping with the prevailing mood, one which sees an unshackled England looking to play positive cricket this summer. But similarly it was hard not to conclude that the manoeuvre is best performed by those to whom it comes naturally.</p> \n<p>Cook, prior to this series, had watched from afar – or, more accurately, from a farm – as the one-day side had belted New Zealand to all parts. And then, after England trained for the Ashes at a golf resort in Spain, his Essex team-mates gave Lyon the treatment in Australia’s four-day warm-up match at Chelmsford, leaving the spinner with combined figures of one for 200.</p> \n<p>And so, perhaps craving a slice of the action himself, a player whose oft-listed qualities include patience, obduracy and self-denial tried to unleash his own rebranded batting style. It was very un-Cook and eventually, after 13 successive dot balls, Lyon got his man when the England captain went to cut a ball too close to his body and was caught behind by a jubilant Brad Haddin.</p> \n<p>This battle within a battle – one of the lesser trailed of the pre-Ashes analysis – was a first blow struck for his opposite number, Michael Clarke, who will doubtless have observed Cook’s inability to get on top of New Zealand’s Mark Craig during the drawn Test series. It also neatly summed up the confusion surrounding the buzzword of the summer: aggression.</p> \n<p>The England captain does not read the newspapers, something he betrayed when confusing two titles when speaking before this Test. But perhaps, after the appointment of his new head coach, Trevor Bayliss, a leaf through the next day’s offerings would have been instructive. Because among the many salient points made by the Australian in his 30-minute briefing at Lord’s, was his own understanding of the word.</p> \n<p>“Being aggressive is not necessarily trying to hit fours and sixes,” said Bayliss. “It’s that mental aggressiveness, thinking about rotating the strike, where are my singles, what bad balls can I hit for four, how are they trying to get me out, being mentally aware of what’s going on around you. You do that, the bad ball comes along, you hit it for four or six.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/08/wales-ashes-first-test-ecb-glamorgan-england-australia\">Wales puts on a woolly welcome as ECB tries to feed the Glamorgan fire | Barney Ronay</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Up until Lyon’s introduction in the 10th over Cook had done exactly this. He was fully on top of Australia’s muscular pace attack, albeit on a surface that was anything but The Gabba. We need not fear for his game at present and the fretful analysis of every non-century that, prior to his 105 in Barbados nearly engulfed English cricket altogether, should not return any time soon.</p> \n<p>And he is no mug against spin, after all, as shown during the India tour in 2012 when he ground Ravichandran Ashwin, Harbhajan Singh and Pragyan Ojha into the dirt en route to that history-making 2-1 series win. There he got the sweep out of the locker and nudged the single to perfection, in a display of aggressive occupation.</p> \n<p>And so, if he is going to ride the wave of positive intent that has been on show this summer – one which he admits must now filter into his captaincy – Cook’s approach against spinners this series must follow the words of his new coach: “Individuals have to play their natural game.”</p> \n<p>On day one in Cardiff he did the opposite.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/8/1436377825449/alastair-cook-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Alastair Cook is caught by Brad Haddin for 20 two balls after the drinks break and trying to cut Nathan Lyon.

He was clearly unhappy. Along with everyone else in Austria for the previous race I had quoted an agency report and said that Ecclestone had described F1 as “crap”.</p> \n<p>Not so, he wanted to tell me. In discussion with engineers on the topic of the new(ish) hybrid engines he told them that they had given him “a shitty product to sell”.</p> \n<p>But, it transpired, Ecclestone just wanted to have a natter about the sport he has presided over for four decades. And it is clear that the sport’s chief executive, who will be 85 in October but has not suffered any decline in his mischievousness, wanted to make known his views about the whole vroom vroom (sotto) business. And engines clearly preoccupy his attention.</p> \n<p>The 1.6-litre V6 hybrid power units introduced last year have never really been to Ecclestone’s liking. They have always been too quiet for him, for one thing. “If I had a clean sheet piece of paper the first thing I would do is make an engine that is not as complicated as the current one is,” he told me. “We need another Cosworth to supply teams.” Cosworth, funded by Ford, powered F1 cars to 176 victories – making it second only to Ferrari – between 1963 and 2003 and as recently as 2010 supplied four teams, Williams, Lotus, HRT and Virgin.</p> \n<p>“If we had a simpler engine it would allow other people who wanted to make engines to come in. Look at Toyota, who I know – maybe – would be interested in coming back into Formula One. But no way would they come back with this power unit. They know that they would be in trouble before they start. If Ferrari are in trouble what chance have they got?”</p> \n<p>The Mercedes power unit has dominated F1 this season as it did in 2014. But Ecclestone has misgivings. “Mercedes have got a super team, a super engine which is an incredible piece of engineering. But if you and I and go the grandstand and ask a spectator ‘How many cylinders has that engine got?’ one or two might get it right. And then you ask them what capacity it is. They don’t know, and they don’t care. They couldn’t care less.</p> \n<p>“They want to see Williams winning, Ferrari winning, Red Bull winning – they want everybody to have a chance of winning. At the moment people like Vijay [Mallya] at Force India spend an awful lot of money and have got zero chance of winning. And it’s not on. Let’s tear the bloody rule book up and start again.”</p> \n<p>Ecclestone is also worried that the drivers are not enjoying it as much as they once did. “I speak closely to most of the guys and they say the same thing: ‘It ain’t any fun any more.’ Because they’re on the limit but they’re not on their limit, if you know what I mean.</p> \n<p>“When you get in a car and you’re on it and somebody says ‘be careful, you’re going to run out of fuel!’ We’re not a sport for saving fuel.</p> \n<p>“Somebody said to me the other day that the way we’re going anyone will be able to drive these cars. A kid will be able to drive it, or anyone who has mucked around with PlayStation and can listen to instructions.”</p> \n<p>It is also clear that Ecclestone and the other little big man of Formula One, the rather too consensual FIA president Jean Todt, will never see eye to eye.</p> \n<p>“The trouble is we have an FIA president who wants everyone to agree. And that’s not possible. We don’t want to have to have a committee before you do something. That’s what we’ve got, and you’re never going to do anything that way. We need someone who will turn the lights on and off, whoever that is. But it’s going to happen. We’re going to make it happen.”</p> \n<p>The problem for Ecclestone is that he cannot be the dictator he once was. The sport’s majority shareholders these days are CVC Capital Partners, for whom Ecclestone works. The leading teams also have more control than they did. The teams are calling the shots, when it comes to rules and regulations, and that cannot be the best way forward.</p> \n<p>Most people are agreed: the best thing that could happen to Formula One is for it to be sold by CVC, who bought it for &pound;1bn in 2006 and have made five times that much since, while failing to reinvest their huge profits in the sport.</p> \n<p>So will F1 be sold, I asked Ecclestone? “There are genuinely people who want to buy,” he told me. “And CVC’s job is buying and selling companies. Donald Mackenzie is the major shareholder and he doesn’t want to sell. He loves the business and he loves Formula One. But he’s very good. He wants to get the sport in the right hands. He won’t sell it for a lousy price, but the people who are interested aren’t offering a lousy price.”</p> \n<p>The Miami Dolphins owner, Stephen Ross, is one of the potential buyers. “That would help us in America for sure,” said Ecclestone. “The guy involved is already in that business.” At Silverstone on Sunday, though, Ecclestone did not give me the impression that he was about to go anywhere.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436373424116/Bernie-Ecclestone-says-F1-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bernie Ecclestone says F1 drivers are telling him that the fun has been taken out of the sport.

The England forward was also unhappy at not being told when Manchester City and Manchester United made initial inquiries about his availability.</p> \n<p>When Liverpool were asked about Sterling’s stance they categorically denied it. However, it is clear there has been a breakdown between the player and Rodgers which makes the player’s presence on Liverpool’s tour to the Far East and Australia even more unlikely.</p> \n<p>City have had a &pound;40m bid turned down by Liverpool but remain interested in buying Sterling. But it is understood City have no plans to make a higher offer for a player valued at &pound;50m by Liverpool.</p> \n<p>While the hierarchy may decide to make a further offer for Sterling at some point in the future, for the moment there is no intent to do so.Sterling did not report for training at Liverpool’s Melwood complex on Wednesday morning, saying that he was ill. The club did not offer any comment although the medical department has been asked to verify Sterling’s claim, which is standard procedure for any player who calls in sick.</p> \n<p>The 20-year-old does not wish to take his seat on the plane when the squad fly to the Far East on Sunday to start their close-season tour. Liverpool, though, are clear he should travel and be available for selection for the first match in Bangkok on Tuesday. It remains to be seen how Sterling’s feelings of discontent with Rodgers will affect the club’s stance over the coming days.</p> \n<p>Liverpool may decide that it is better if Sterling is not part of the squad as Rodgers continues his preparations for the season. The manager is under pressure to ensure that Liverpool hit the ground running following the dismal end to their last campaign, during which they were knocked out of the Champions League at the group stage, lost on penalties to Besiktas in the last 32 of the Europa League and finished sixth in the Premier League, suffering a 6-1 defeat at Stoke City in their final game of the season.</p> \n<p>In order for Liverpool to improve on that performance it would hardly be of benefit to have a player who does not wish to be at the club.</p> \n<p>Luis Su&aacute;rez joined Liverpool on their pre-season tour of Australia in 2013 while pressing for a move to Arsenal. However, Rodgers and the club believed the striker could still be persuaded to stay and Su&aacute;rez returned to produce spectacular form that came close to taking Liverpool to the Premier League title. There appears to be no chance of such an outcome with Sterling, so it seems a matter of when not if he will leave.</p> \n<p>Danny Ings, who joined the club from Burnley in June, has spoken of his admiration for Rodgers. “He’s fantastic at developing young players. For a player like me, I think it will be perfect to work with him. I’m really looking forward to getting that relationship with him and the rest of the coaches and the players as well. It’s something I’m really excited to do,” he told the club website.</p> \n<p>“He [Rodgers] wants me to come in, settle in and get used to the lads and enjoy training. Then we’re going to do some tactical stuff, which he does with every player, as you do coming in.</p> \n<p>“Then obviously I’ll see how his team plays and how I can adapt to the way that Liverpool play. It’s definitely going to be a challenge but it’s a challenge that I’m looking forward to. I just can’t wait to get started.”</p> \n<p>Along with Ings, Rodgers has acted swiftly in the transfer market this summer and has also signed Joe Gomez, James Milner, Nathaniel Clyne, Adam Bogdan and Roberto Firmino.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436381297251/Raheem-Sterling-left-seem-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Raheem Sterling, left, seems to have fallen out irrevocably with Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers.

It’s too bad. He’s about the best welterweight Mayweather could have fought. </p> \n<p>But there are plenty of other names jockeying for a shot at the man they call “Money” in what might be his final ring battle. Mayweather has mentioned some fighters, while other potential opponents have put their own names into the mix. Let’s consider the contenders. And let’s rate them on a scale of one to five stars in both likelihood and whether whether they’re worth a damn as Mayweather opponents.</p> \n<h2>Andre Berto</h2> \n<p>Mayweather recently threw this name out alongside Karim Mayfield. There’s almost no chance this fight will happen, even though some are calling Berto the favourite and the pair have been involved in <a href=\"http://www.tmz.com/2015/06/25/floyd-mayweather-andre-berto-is-delusional-hes-not-even-on-my-speed-dial/\">some squawking about prank calls</a>. It doesn’t fit the Mayweather method. He likes opponents who have at least a modicum of credibility, usually because they have a recent win of note and some palpable popularity at least somewhere. Berto has neither – a win over Josesito Lopez doesn’t count. I’m not sure why he even brought up their names, unless it’s to troll Amir Khan, who wants the fight so bad.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: **<br />Desirability: * </p> \n<h2>Kell Brook</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e3534f0d668557ca4dece82f0098ea0c05e055b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352602063/ea2ea49a-341d-46f7-b148-576607986bcb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kell Brook\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kell Brook celebrates after beating Jo Jo Dan in their IBF welterweight title fight in March 2015.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Heathcote/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Brook is just a touch too dangerous to be terribly likely, which is exactly why he’s one of the best options. He’s young, explosive and undefeated. That he has some fans in the UK&nbsp;would bring some additional marketability to the fight; Mayweather is usually fond of taking on opponents with an ethnic or regional constituency, and the UK fits that approach,&nbsp;as he showed with the fight against&nbsp;Ricky Hatton. But his combination of “good” and “hasn’t fought in the U.S. much” handicaps him as the guy to get the call.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: **<br />Desirability: **** </p> \n<h2>Gennady Golovkin</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"27568d39cda9fbf01d2917b4fa1add4b0b02ec21\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436353026218/b584aa2b-edb1-4e08-afe3-1ea953ee4364-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Golovkin\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gennady Golovkin.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Cziborra/Action Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mayweather is at least indulging the fight, which is weird. Mainly he’s indulging it by saying Golovkin is unknown, isn’t smart enough and&nbsp;would have to face some additional weight restrictions. Make no mistake, were Mayweather to take this fight even with some unusual limitations at 154, we would be talking about one of the ballsiest moves he could make.&nbsp;Golovkin is huge compared to Mayweather and he’s&nbsp;skilled and powerful. He’s also been doing solid ratings on HBO. But he’s just too risky for Floyd’s final fight.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: *<br />Desirability: ***** </p> \n<h2>Amir Khan</h2> \n<p>One gets the impression Mayweather enjoys tormenting the especially thirsty Khan, and right now he’s got him cotton-mouthed and dehydrated. It’s too bad <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/30/amir-khan-fights-off-spirited-challenge-from-chris-algieri\">Khan struggled against Chris Algieri</a>, even if Algieri deserves more credit than Khan deserves blame for the closeness of the fight. Before that showing, Khan’s length and speed figured as an interesting theoretical challenge for Mayweather, if not one in reality. Still, it’s credible enough-ish.<br /></p> \n<p>Likelihood: ****<br />Desirability: *** </p> \n<h2>Anthony Mundine</h2> \n<p>Mundine – the most recent entrant in the Mayweather sweepstakes, who pitched his services in <a href=\"http://boxa.com.au/open-letter-to-floyd-mayweather-from-anthony-mundine/\">a clawing&nbsp;open&nbsp;letter</a> – has losses to Manny Siaca, Garth Wood and Joshua Clottey on his record. None of them are remotely in the class of Mayweather.&nbsp;Mundine earned a quality win in his last fight, against&nbsp;Sergey Rabchenko,&nbsp;but his only argument for a shot against&nbsp;Mayweather is&nbsp;based on his big mouth and tendency to make&nbsp;controversial remarks. One big problem with that selling point, though, is that Mundine is mainly known in Australia, and Mayweather isn’t even welcome in that country.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: *<br />Desirability: *</p> \n<h2>Karim Mayfield</h2> \n<p>You can&nbsp;understand how Mayweather could throw out Berto’s name. He’s been a TV staple for forever. But&nbsp;Mayfield? He’s practically been banished, owing to the kind of outings that make boxing’s bloodlust crowd screech like they just hopped up on a chair after seeing a mouse. Plus, losses to Thomas Dulorme and Emmanuel Taylor in two of his last three fights –&nbsp;that’s such a bad look. Is there such a thing as half a fist? Would it look like a middle finger?<br /></p> \n<p>Likelihood: *<br />Desirability: *</p> \n<h2>Shawn Porter</h2> \n<p>Last weekend, Porter beat Adrien Broner, who had played Mayweather’s “little brother” in a past life, owing to his talent, flashy/obnoxious personality and winning ways. So we got a storyline. It was also a good win for Porter, elevating his profile before 2.4m&nbsp;viewers. Stylistically, it’s one of the more interesting possibilities.&nbsp;Marcos Maidana’s pressure gave Mayweather some trouble&nbsp;and Porter would&nbsp;pressure him, but he doesn’t hit that hard, and has been outboxed, so it’s not as risky.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: ****<br />Desirability: **** </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/queensberry-rules-boxing-blog/2015/jun/12/boxing-mixed-emotions-knock-out-punches\">The mixed emotions of watching a boxer you know and like being knocked out</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Errol Spence</h2> \n<p>OK, this one isn’t serious. Spence mistakenly said that he wanted to fight Mayweather next, when he meant Keith Thurman. Spence is just a prospect, albeit a damn good one, or else this would rank higher in terms of desirability. Mayweather is talking up Spence as a candidate to face some of the guys who are targeting him, like Porter and Thurman. If you believe that <a href=\"http://ringtv.craveonline.com/news/355355-errol-spence-jr-on-intense-sparring-with-floyd-mayweather-jr\">Spence gave Mayweather a black eye in sparring</a> – as is alleged – this could be a desirable fight.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: *<br />Desirability: *** </p> \n<h2>Keith Thurman</h2> \n<p>Thurman would promote the fight well with his loquacity; he’s thought of as a powerful puncher; he can box; and he’s a rising name. He’s not as threatening as he once seemed, with his power fading in recent fights. So he has that mix of vulnerability and a perception of being really good, and the ability to market a fight. It’s confusing that Mayweather seems to be talking him down.</p> \n<p>Likelihood: ****<br />Desirability: ****</p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article first appeared on <a href=\"http://bloguin.com/queensberryrules/\">The Queensberry Rules</a><br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tqbr\">The Queensberry Rules</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timstarks\">Tim Starks</a> on Twitter</strong></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436350035769/4d2198b3-43b6-447d-8d7d-674a08875747-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Reuters/Reuters","altText":"Mayweather","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Reuters/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352603302/ea2ea49a-341d-46f7-b148-576607986bcb-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kell Brook celebrates after beating Jo Jo Dan in their IBF welterweight title fight in March 2015.
