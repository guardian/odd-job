Even <a href=\"https://youtu.be/V5moKfZ9Y2Q?t=29s\">before Luciano Pavarotti fills his lungs,</a> as the lilting melody of the chorus of Nessun Dorma starts to rise, via musical time travel we arrive smack bang in the midst of Italia 90.</p> \n<p>Some critics of the day found it hard to care for that World Cup. For the purists, it lacked the required flamboyance, defending was cynical, and the final reeked of ill-tempered drudgery. But to assess Italia 90 only according to those parameters is to miss all the virtues that gave it meaning. It might be pushing it slightly to say that everything I learned about life I learned at that World Cup, but if all Italia 90 kids don’t admit that month was transformative, I will consider eating my Ciao hat. (That was the very stylish mascot, by the way – a stick man with tricolore colouring and a football head.)</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/may/15/england-world-cup-italia-1990-gary-lineker-diego-maradona\">England's performance at Italia 90 World Cup is venerated too much | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It might not have been a World Cup of great games, but it was a World Cup of memorable tales and epic emotions: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2006/jun/02/smalltalk.sportinterviews\">Roger Milla shook his 38-year-old hips</a> at the corner flag for himself, for Africa, for old people anywhere who don’t give up believing in the unbelievable. Tot&ograve; Schillaci smashed in shots, wheeled off with his crazed eyes virtually popping out of their sockets, and became an unlikely hero. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/may/22/25-stunning-world-cup-moments-\">Frank Rijkaard and Rudi V&ouml;ller were entwined in a spitting red card fandango</a>.

Italy wept as they were niggled through the semi-final and left vanquished by Argentina in Diego Maradona’s adopted city of Naples.</p> \n<p>And then in the final, to paraphrase Lineker’s famous phrase, 22 men chased a ball around (which became 20 after two red cards) and at the end, the Germans won. Franz Beckenbauer entered that special double club of World Cup winners as player and manager.</p> \n<p>But there is a broader picture even beyond the stories embroidered on the pitch. Italia 90 was the bridge from old style World Cups to the new. Four years afterwards, Fifa began its quest to spread its tentacles, to take the show into territories where football was less rooted. Since departing Rome’s Olympic Stadium in 1990 with Lothar Matth&auml;us’s arms around the golden trophy, three out of the subsequent six World Cups have taken place outside the traditional powerbases: USA 94, Japan and South Korea 2002, South Africa 2010 (alternating with three historic football countries in France, Germany and Brazil). If we factor in the next two competitions currently set for Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022, that trend towards developing markets carries even more weight.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e109eb09585eb4bc2fc8555a420f6966714eccdd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434364587180/c981dc4f-b61f-4502-acca-44125a36798e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"England's manager Bobby Robson poses with Ciao, the mascot of the 1990 World Cup.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England’s manager Bobby Robson poses with Ciao, the mascot of the 1990 World Cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cannon/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Italia 90 took place in an era where attending a World Cup was not an outrageously extravagant idea for an adventurous football fan. There was no notion of hotels or restaurants bumping up their prices by insane percentages to rip off visitors. Tickets floated about at face value if you looked hard enough in most host cities, certainly in the group stage. Word got round in the streets of the names of shops and bars which were selling match tickets up to the eve of the game. There were no fan parks, it was all improvised for better or for worse. The idea of a group of corporate punters forming a crocodile in branded baseball hats following a pretty girl holding up a sign bearing the name of a vast conglomerate as they march to a tented village would not have got very far. That audience didn’t want to go to football anyway then.</p> \n<p>Confession: I retain the same blind love for Italia 90 today that struck me then. I was 18 years old, and it was beyond exciting for anyone who experienced it as a seminal World Cup experience. Luckily for me, not only was I at the right time of life to be able to plan my month around watching games, filling in wallcharts and so on, I was also old enough, and had enough free time in a post-exam lull, to actually go. The decision was spontaneous, made in the crazy excitement of the opening game, which I watched on telly with a couple of friends, Nick (Leeds United) and Paul (Everton).</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/feb/12/world-cup-25-stunning-moments-cameroon-argentina\">Cameroon v Argentina was dubbed the Miracle of Milan</a>. It was symbolic of how entrants from Africa were regarded that the BBC commentator described them, in a manner that seems so patronising today but was not intentional then, as “happy go lucky fellows”. They were able enough to not just compete with Argentina, the reigning champions, but to defeat them.</p> \n<p>We looked at each other after the final whistle confirmed one of the most improbable of all World Cup results with the same thought at the same time: Let’s go.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2010/oct/14/on-second-thoughts-italia-90\">On Second Thoughts: Italia 90 | Rob Smyth</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>After a quick consultation with the wall chart, to determine who was playing where and what would be the best place to aim for, it was destination Genoa and Turin, armed with a couple of hundred quid and a sleeping bag. A fantastic group – Brazil, Sweden, Scotland and Costa Rica – was a great attraction, as was the fact it was significantly distant from England’s base in Sardinia. We wanted to enjoy the World Cup as peaceful football fans, without the bother of reputations shadowing our every step.</p> \n<p>There, with that awkward sentence for an English football-loving person to write, is another key to why Italia 90 mattered so much. In fact maybe it’s part of the explanation for why it matters so much more in England than in many of the other participant countries.</p> \n<p>God knows English football needed a tournament to salve wounds, to mend a broken reputation overseas, with the tragedies of Heysel and Hillsborough – which didn’t have the luxury then of the truth that is emerging at the current inquests all these years later – still so close in our minds and hearts.</p> \n<p>Pete Davies, the author of the outstanding account <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/All-Played-Out-Story-Italia-x/dp/0224059548\">All Played Out</a>, summed up the ambience of the time in a recent interview with Esquire magazine. “The way the game is now derives, to a very great extent, from the transformation that Italia 90 affected. Prior to Italia 90 football in England was perceived as a squalid, hooligan-ridden, embarrassing sump of gormless violence. Our team was crap, our supporters were worse, and you did not talk about it over dinner.”</p> \n<p>We headed by train and ferry to Genoa, far from what was expected to be the madding crowd. We stopped off in Turin, the venue for Brazil’s opening game against Sweden. Then on to Genoa, to take in the surprise of Costa Rica beating Scotland, before Andy Roxburgh’s team redeemed themselves a bit by seeing off Sweden.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1100cb1155fbbf448da8efeb09d12a5402cc7ab4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434364824005/7caf3a2d-f642-4ecc-ac9d-0152c64c726c-326x420.jpeg\" alt=\"A young Amy Lawrence meets a Swedish fan in Genoa during the 1990 World Cup.\" width=\"326\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A young Amy Lawrence meets a Swedish fan in Genoa during the 1990 World Cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amy Lawrence</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There was not enough accommodation for the many meanderers who had made Genoa base camp. The city officials decided the sensible thing was to keep the football fans together, so we were invited to sleep in the railway station. The daily routine went something like this: At around 6am, before the commuters had the misfortune of stepping over a series of comatose bodies on their way to work, the police gently woke us from our slumbers, we packed away our sleeping bags, dumped them in left luggage, and availed ourselves of the station showers for a wash and brush up. Some couldn’t quite manage that so ended up taking a soap and a shave in the ornate fountain which is the centre piece of the beautiful Piazza de Ferrari.</p> \n<p>The days were filled with impromptu football games in the square (there was a local kid who spent the whole time being Roberto Donadoni), the search for tickets, watching matches in cafes, conjuring up ways around the alcohol ban, enjoying the hospitality of the Genovese who brought out their children to have pictures alongside the colourful visitors and invited fans in for giant bowls of pasta.</p> \n<p>It was a true example of a catchphrase later bastardised by Fifa – this was the “football family” where anyone from anywhere was invited for one gigantic party. The evenings became louder, naturally, as the three main groups in town – the Scots, Swedes and Italians – joined in each others’ songs.</p> \n<p>On the day of Scotland v Sweden word got around that a band of pipers, in full regalia despite the sweltering heat, would lead a march through town to the Stadio Luigi Ferraris. Thousands of folk in kilts and Viking helmets mingled as they followed the music and danced to the match.</p> \n<p>Back in England, the team’s progress, and the lack of the kind of trouble everybody feared, was a huge part of the radical change that was coursing through our football in a post-Heysel and Hillsborough world. People who sneered at the game, accustomed to seeing only ugliness, found themselves unexpectedly swept along. Gascoigne, the “daft as a brush” boy who played with such spontaneity and wore his emotions so readily, captured public imagination, and presented a very different image of English football.</p> \n<p>In the coming seasons, with stadiums being reformed to meet all-seater requirements, Nick Hornby’s Fever Pitch expressing the fan’s condition, the restrictions on foreign players being relaxed to open the doors to talent from across the world, the rebranding of the Premier League and arrival of Sky glitz, football would become more glamorous, more welcoming.</p> \n<p>The third-place play-off, contested by two desperately disappointed teams in England and Italy, turned out to be uplifting. After the medals had been doled out, all the players of both squads stood side by side clutching floral bouquets and they took a shared bow. It was an important moment, a bridge-building act of friendship and respect just five years after the nightmare of Heysel.</p> \n<p>For all that it means to English football, to Italians as the hosts whose fairytale didn’t come with a happy ending, to Cameroonians who hoped it would be the gateway to a major breakthrough for African footballers, there are also some other greatly changed nations for whom Italia 90 still has resonance. Four countries no longer exist in the way they did then. It was the last World Cup in which West Germany competed (unification came later in 1990). <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2007/jul/24/newsstory.sport9\">Yugoslavia began to break up in 1991</a>. Czechoslovakia split in 1992. This tournament represented the last appearance at a major finals of the Soviet Union team, as by the time the European Championship came around their place was taken up by the CIS, which was effectively just Russia.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-437658063__\n</div> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/may/15/england-world-cup-italia-1990-gary-lineker-diego-maradona\">Maybe it wasn’t the best World Cup you will ever see</a>. Not many Brazilians or Dutch will reflect with much fondness, which given their status as aesthetic football nations is revealing. The statistics are not positive – the fewest goals per game in the competition’s history and the most red cards at that point.</p> \n<p>But still, it was so profoundly important.

Lunch is approaching fast. Richardson and Muchall have steadied the Durham ship, and they’re 136 for four after 27, so scoring at five an over. Richardson scratched a bit early but has looked good, while Muchall inside edged when a big LBW appeal went up from Linley.

Stoneman weas going along brilliantly, bringing up his 50 from 42 balls with a flick to leg off Linley, but was then caught at slip by Joyce very next ball. He’d hit nine fours and a crunching six, and indeed there’d been 10 boundaries in the first nine overs and Magoffin’s first six overs cost 42. Chris Nash was introduced to stem the flow. Before Stoneman was out, Scott Borthwick had also nibbled at Linley and been caught by Yardy in the cordon for a breezy 24. Run-scoring looks easy, but wickets are falling. It’s now 91 for three and Captain Colly and Michael Richardson are at the crease. Sussex’s fielders are very chirpy.

So a crucial hour has now passed at New Road and what has it brought? The answer is a challenging time for the Warwickshire batsmen, the early loss of Tim Ambrose to Jack Shantry, a let-off for Rikki Clarke early in his innings, and a really good workout for Ian Bell.</p> \n<p>Throughout the 60 minutes, it was Shantry and Leach who bowled, a contrast in styles, the latter robust and full-on, the former quirky, left arm round the wicket almost exclusively, but never to be underestimated even at a pace that is little more than medium. He it was who took the wicket of Ambrose in his first over, the latter not having added to his overnight score and well taken by Ben Cox , standing up to the stumps. Twice in as many deliveries Shantry found unexpected lift from a length, first hitting Bell on the right glove, causing him to wring his fingers, and then doing the same to Clarke, who shortly afterwards, when 9, edged Shantry only for Cox, an otherwise impressive keeper up to the stumps, to miss the chance.</p> \n<p>Bell had reached his half century at the start of the day by gliding Shantry to the third man boundary, a trademark Bell shot, and had progressed to 71 while Clarke was still there on 21 as Warwickshire progressed to 155 for five.<br /></p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-557eafcfe4b0e706bc8be0ae","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:58:52Z","body":"<p>Gary Naylor’s weekly county cricket blog is up...</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/99-94-cricket-blog/2015/jun/15/county-cricket-final-over-durham-hampshire-yorkshire-lancashire\">County cricket: the week's final over</a> </p> \n</aside>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-557eaaa3e4b0e706bc8be084","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T10:36:23Z","body":"<p>Hello again.

With conditions only set to improve throughout the match and it being all a little gloomy this morning, Joyce had a case to have a bowl, especially with the celebrated North-Eastern nibble merchants at large. And his own gun Steve Magoffin gave him reason to celebrate as he jagged one back through Keaton Jennings’ unlatched gate after 15 minutes. Since, there have been some lovely strokes, including three consecutive Stoneman boundaries - driven and cut through off and flicked fine to leg – off Magoffin’s fifth over.

They were the ones who pushed for a 12.30pm start in order to attract more punters after work, but 42 overs lost to bad light on day one kind of defeats the object.</p> \n<p>I’m not so sure starting 90 minutes later will work wonders for the crowd anyway. I would much rather see play start at 2.30pm and finish under lights, which gives spectators a good three hours of play after work. As things stand, you would be lucky to get an hour’s viewing in. How many people finish work bang on 5pm these days? Not many, I’d wager. It’s more likely to be 5.30pm. Then you have to navigate rush hour traffic, which is not pleasant in Manchester.</p> \n<p>Anyway, yesterday was a good day on the field for Lancashire, who bowled Leicestershire out for 207 in 50 overs, with James Faulkner claiming the first hat-trick of his career. He was of the view that the Red Rose did not bowl as well as they could have, but gained that bit of luck. A good day of batting for the hosts and you struggle to see a way back for Mark Cosgrove and company.</p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-557ea02ae4b07c61f71d1ea6","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T09:51:54Z","body":"<p>A very fine Monday morning to you all from Arundel, which is unfortunately colder but happily a good deal calmer than it was at 4pm yesterday afternoon. As you’ve no doubt heard, Surrey’s Rory Burns and Moises Henriques had a sickening outfield clash that left both players unconscious and many hearts in cricketing mouths for the 40 minutes it took for them to be lifted into ambulances and taken to hospital in Chichester. Thankfully, it appears both are fine – Burns has had a load of stitches on cuts to his face and will leave hospital this afternoon, while last night Henriques had an operation on a jaw broken in three places and will stay in for another 24 hours. We’ll file it under near misses, I think.</p> \n<p>Anyway, back to the cricket. Durham are at Arundel today and, on a notorious road, Sussex’s Ed Joyce – presumably spooked by his team’s torrid recent record with the bat on a spitty Hove square – has put Durham in. Maybe he didn’t fancy facing Rushworth, Onions &amp; co on a cloudy morning. Anyway, loanees Tim Linley and George Dockrell go straight into the Sussex side, while Ajmal Shahzad returns from injury too.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, we have Mike Selvey at Worcestershire-Warwickshire, where Ian Bell resumes 46* looking for an Ashes-readying ton after 14 wickets fell on day one. Warwickshire trail by 142. And Graham Hardcastle is at Old Trafford for Lancashire’s trendy late kick off with Leicestershire. He’ll be with us from 12.30 when Lancs will be batting after a Jimmy Faulkner hat-trick reduced Leicestershire to 207.</p> \n<p>There are three more games going on. There’s a new-starter at Guildford, where Surrey face Glamorgan with a rather makeshift batting lineup in the absence of Burns, Pietersen, Sangakkara and more. Then Alastair Cook at Chelmsford is looking to go big on a tough wicket. He and his team had a fine first day against Derbyshire, bowling them out for 148 and reaching 108 for none, with the Chef 50 not out. On a Taunton track that seems to fit with the stereotype, Nottinghamshire resume 391/6 after a brilliant 152 from Brendan Taylor.</p> \n<p>Enjoy the cricket, folks.</p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-557e9773e4b07c61f71d1e80","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-15T09:48:28Z","body":"<p>Morning all,</p> \n<p>Today we have at Graham Hardcastle at Old Trafford for Lancashire v Leicestershire, Will Macpherson at Arundel for Surrey v Durham and Mike Selvey at Worcester for Worcestershire v Warwickshire.

That’s a long time, but we keep working hard, keep moving in the right direction and gaining experience all the time; that’s all you can do.</p> \n<p>“We don’t talk too much about the future, but the team are moving in the right direction. Everyone is gaining more experience, the younger players in the Premier League and, come next summer, they’ll have another year under their belt and more England caps. Experience is key going into the tournament and there is a lot of unfinished business from last summer. It’s something personally I cant wait to come around and put right. I’m sure everyone feels the same way.”</p> \n<p>England’s qualification group is hardly onerous. But having already visited Scotland and Italy in high-profile friendlies, the side will face France and Germany, then potentially Holland and Spain next season as they gear up for Euro 2016. That will provide a proper test of progress, though the squad are taking heart from their 11-match unbeaten run.</p> \n<p>“It’s been fantastic and the year we’ve had shouldn’t be overlooked,” added Cahill. “It’s a great achievement, something we are very proud of and something we spoke about before this game. When we went 1-0 down against Slovenia it wasn’t ideal, but we responded in the right way. We didn’t want to waste all our hard work.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434364940296/Gary-Cahill-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gary Cahill believes England can make amends for their poor showing at past international tournaments with success at Euro 2016.
