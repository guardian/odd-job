Hours later, he was woken by Swiss plainclothes police officers.

key questions answered</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>And the jaw-dropping indictments published in the US laid bare the extent of Fifa’s graft and corruption that has flourished under Blatter’s watch.</p> \n<p>From bribes paid during the race for the 2010 South Africa World Cup to the 2011 presidential election and the model of kickbacks on TV and sponsorship deals that has been adopted by generation upon generation of Fifa executives, the modus operandi of world football’s governing body is laid bare.</p> \n<p>The damning list of indictments from the US Department of Justice named three current

attorney general into the award of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, 10 current members of the Fifa executive committee will also be questioned over the next 48 hours.</p> \n<p>Many of the officials from 209 member countries who had flooded into Zurich’s luxury hotels over the previous 48 hours expecting an enjoyable week at Fifa’s expense were visibly shaken as they attempted to carry on the various meetings that dominate the build up to Friday’s Congress.</p> \n<p>Most seasoned Fifa watchers agreed that Wednesday’s early morning action was unprecedented and presented Blatter with the greatest threat to his authority yet.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a

\n<p>It is understood that US investigators and the Swiss prosecutor’s office have been cooperating for some time and it is the shift in mood in his homeland that will most trouble Blatter, for all that his spokesman was keen to underline that he was not involved.</p> \n<p>He somehow managed to keep a straight face while insisting that the chaos and drama was good for Fifa and that Blatter could not be held responsible for the fallout at an organisation from which he has become indivisible over his 40 years.</p> \n<p>In typical Fifa fashion, spokesman Walter De Gregorio also reiterated that there would be no revote on the 2018 and 2022 World Cups before being forced to admit that he could not predict what would happen in the future.</p> \n<p>As well as the immediate future of Blatter, his estimated $10m salary, and some of his key lieutenants, it is the award of those two tournaments that will again now come under scrutiny and will be of perhaps most interest to football fans around the world.</p> \n<p>That vote on 2 December 2010 has had longstanding ramifications, but Fifa mistakenly believed it had drawn a line under the increasing weight of allegations with a report by investigator Michael Garcia’s that he later disowned.</p> \n<p>Blatter said in December that there was not enough evidence of wrongdoing to justify stripping either country of the tournament, despite Russia’s refusal to cooperate with the investigation and outstanding questions over Qatar’s bid.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\"

\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Throughout all the scandals that have echoed down his reign since he became president in 1998 and amid allegations that some votes had been secured improperly, Blatter has returned to the same tried and tested techniques to try and deflect criticism and engender loyalty among the 209 associations that have benefited from ever increasing development money.</p> \n<p>In the court of Blatter, they are well used to shrugging off scandals that would have long since sunk other organisations.<br /></p> \n<p>But just as it took the involvement of US law enforcement to finally get to the truth in another long-running sporting scandal – institutionalised doping in professional cycling – so it appears that the culture cultivated and overseen by Blatter could finally be brought crashing down.</p> \n<p>For many in Switzerland, Fifa has gone from a source of pride to an embarrassment. The mood has changed and for Blatter, whatever the outcome of the vote on Friday, this is unlikely to be the end of the story. Following his grandstanding speeches at Fifa gatherings, Blatter likes to end with a flourish and the catchphrase: “For the game, for the world”.</p> \n<p>Over 24 dramatic hours, for Fifa and Blatter the game has definitively changed. Or as James Comey, director of the FBI, said on Wednesday: “The field was hijacked. This investigation has been long and painstaking and it is not over.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/672f3d1e86ba77dd94498adb2edf7cdf4528af8d/0_72_3851_2309/3851.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2309,"width":3851,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Steffen Schmidt/EPA","altText":"fifa sepp blatter","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Steffen Schmidt/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a22704d216375ebe5e628f8b8be73ec97c869c0b/1427_726_1004_1506/1004.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1506,"width":1004,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Prince Ali bin al Hussein, vice president of Fifa for Asia, has called for urgent steps to end the crisis.

Sevilla, playing their familiar attractive football, became the first side to win the Europa League for the fourth time – astonishingly only nine years after they won it for the first time.</p> \n<p>While Jos&eacute; Antonio Reyes offered a reminder of his energy and inventiveness for an hour, this was really the victory of two men who confirmed their great promise.</p> \n<p>Unai Emery, the 43-year-old coach, defended the title he won by beating Benfica in the final last year, but in a far more fluent, aesthetically pleasing way, while the 28-year-old Colombia forward, Carlos Bacca, demonstrated his predatory instincts with two goals.</p> \n<p>Emery dedicated the victory to his father, who died a fortnight ago. “I would like to remember my father,” he said. “He passed away recently so he can’t be here today. He’s pushed us along to give us victory. This is a special moment and we have to live it fully.”</p> \n<p>He referred also to Antonio Puerta, the Sevilla midfielder who died in 2007 at the age of 22. “The joy that we feel is felt by those who are no longer with us,” Emery said. “Life brings bitter moments so you must experience joy fully when it is there.”</p> \n<p>On a day that had showcased so much of what is wrong with the sport this was a game that offered a welcome reminder of football’s capacity to thrill and enthral, the only sadness being that the corollary to Sevilla’s deserved victory was defeat for a Dnipro side who had played with courage and conviction to overcome numerous obstacles to reach this stage.</p> \n<p>It said much for the good will Dnipro have generated that their coach Myron Markevych was applauded into his post-match press conference. Emery, too, paid tribute to their performance and to those who had travelled from Ukraine to be in Poland.</p> \n<p>For Dnipro’s fans, many of whom had tickets and transport paid for by players, this was not only a final – only the fifth the club has ever been involved in – and the first since they lost to Shakhtar Donetsk in the 2004 Ukrainian Cup. There were over 60,000 at the Olimpiyskyi in Kiev for the semi-final victory over Napoli and in the ecstatic pitch invasion that followed the final whistle there was a sense of abandon and of patriotic fervour. In the streets of Warsaw during the afternoon and in the stadium, it was notable how many Dnipro fans had wrapped themselves in the blue and yellow flag of Ukraine: there was a real sense of this as a matter of national pride. Ruslan Rotan, Dnipro’s captain, while insisting on the importance of separating sport and politics, had spoken before the game of wanting to “give the people some joy”. It took just seven minutes for some joy to be delivered – although it did not last long.</p> \n<p>Sevilla had passed and probed and packed all the early menace but it was Dnipro who took the lead. Artem Fedetskyi launched a long forward pass, Nikola Kalinic flicked it on for Matheus, who then crossed for the Croat to head low past Sergio Rico. Kalinic, who once underwhelmed for Blackburn Rovers, was only playing because of a muscular injury that confined Yevhen Seleznyov to the bench, but he offered a similarly muscular presence, holding up the ball and offering an outlet when Dnipro found themselves under pressure.</p> \n<p>They were, though, under an awful lot of pressure. Reyes, buzzing in his familiar arabesques on the right, had hit a low shot just wide and Grzegorz Krychowiak had a header superbly saved by Denys Boyko when, after 27 minutes, the Poland midfielder pulled Sevilla level, cracking in a low shot as a corner fell to him just inside the box.</p> \n<p>Three minutes later, Sevilla took the lead their early play had deserved, a Reyes pass putting in Bacca, the former bus conductor from Barranquilla. The striker was forced wide as he took the ball round Boyko but maintained his composure to finish.</p> \n<p>At that point it seemed all but inevitable that Dnipro would wilt in the face of the red storm. Their run in the Europa League, though, has been characterised by doggedness and they showed tremendous resourcefulness not merely to dig in but to change their game plan and take the game to Sevilla.</p> \n<p>Yevhen Konoplyanka, whose contract expires in the summer and who has been linked to Liverpool and Tottenham, drew a fine stretching save from Rico after performing his signature trick of cutting in from the left, before the equaliser arrived in the final minute of the half. Rotan, who nearly joined Rubin Kazan in the summer before being persuaded to stay by Markevych, flicked a delicious free-kick over the wall and inside the left-hand post.</p> \n<p>“We have grown as a team during the tournament,” Emery said. “We knew we had to keep calm and stick together. Gradually, Sevilla’s intensity was cranked up again and, as in the first half, Dnipro cracked. St&eacute;phane Mbia prodded a dropping ball forward after 72 minutes and, although Jaba Kankava half blocked it, Vitolo reacted sharply enough to prod the ball through for Bacca, who jabbed a finish past Boyko.</p> \n<p>“We deserved to let in the third goal,” Markevych said. “We should have just kicked the ball away. Defensively we made a lot of mistakes.” It was not the prettiest goal, but it was a strike that showed just how valuable poaching reflexes can still be in a game that has largely moved away from the sniffer type of forward (although Bacca is far more rounded than that).</p> \n<p>This time Dnipro could not come back. By the closing minutes they seemed exhausted, emotional as well as physical energy spent. The desire for a victory that might offer some token of comfort to and solidarity with those in the east of Ukraine east was worthy enough but it was not enough to overcome the effervescence of Emery’s Sevilla.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"336f5d78524e0b3e0bdb5bdfaf886b8cfe911c83\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432764735741/4f102b37-f2da-4230-b263-3eb9c6bc0ea7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sevilla Players celebrate with the trophy at the end of their 3-2 victor over FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sevilla players celebrate with the trophy at the end of their 3-2 victory over FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk in the Europa Cup final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Franco Romano/NurPhoto/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432764207526/Sevillas-Carlos-Bacca-rou-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sevilla's Carlos Bacca rounds goalkeeper Denys Boyko on the way to scoring the Spanish side's  second goal in their 3-2 Europa League final win against Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk.

Yes, Dnipro’s a lovely story, the unheralded team from the fringes of the continent who have won no silverware of any sort for a quarter of a century but who have reached a major European final in the very season that they’ve been prevented by war from playing any ties at home. Dnipro’s odyssey has uplifted a whole nation, with the team’s defiance of daunting adversity inspiring all of Ukraine at a time of great peril. They are surely not the prettiest team to watch – their style is rooted in grit, gumption and a dollop of counter-attacking flair – but they are very much admired and victory for them tonight would be welcomed far and wide. </p> \n<p>So Sevilla find themselves cast in the uncharacteristic role of spoilsports. Their city duel with Real Betis notwithstanding, Sevilla are often the ones flying the flag for the underdog, being among the clubs that have to russle up a meal from the scraps that Barcelona and Real Madrid toss to the rest of Spain. So it would be quite a feat – and another indictment of Premier League clubs – if Sevilla tonight became the first team to win this trophy four times. You can be sure that Unai Emergy has devised a 45-point plan detailing how they can do precisely that (for more on Emery, check out <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/27/sevilla-manager-europa-league-final-unai-emery\">this illuminating chat with Sid Lowe)</a>. <br /></p> \n<p>Team news will be in shortly. In the meantime, perhaps you’d like to reminisce about other heart-warming football tales? Even Hull fans, for instance, must have felt a little glow from seeing Jonas Gutierrez scoring to help keep Newcastle up last weekend.

Yes, Dnipro’s a lovely story, the unheralded team from the fringes of the continent who have won no silverware of any sort for a quarter of a century but who have reached a major European final in the very season that they’ve been prevented by war from playing any ties at home. Dnipro’s odyssey has uplifted a whole nation, with the team’s defiance of daunting adversity inspiring all of Ukraine at a time of great peril. They are surely not the prettiest team to watch – their style is rooted in grit, gumption and a dollop of counter-attacking flair – but they are very much admired and victory for them tonight would be welcomed far and wide. </p> \n<p>So Sevilla find themselves cast in the uncharacteristic role of spoilsports. Their city duel with Real Betis notwithstanding, Sevilla are often the ones flying the flag for the underdog, being among the clubs that have to russle up a meal from the scraps that Barcelona and Real Madrid toss to the rest of Spain. So it would be quite a feat – and another indictment of Premier League clubs – if Sevilla tonight became the first team to win this trophy four times. You can be sure that Unai Emergy has devised a 45-point plan detailing how they can do precisely that (for more on Emery, check out <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/27/sevilla-manager-europa-league-final-unai-emery\">this illuminating chat with Sid Lowe)</a>. <br /></p> \n<p>Team news will be in shortly. In the meantime, perhaps you’d like to reminisce about other heart-warming football tales? Even Hull fans, for instance, must have felt a little glow from seeing Jonas Gutierrez scoring to help keep Newcastle up last weekend. I quite liked <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5JaxeW17xvg\">Gary Bennett putting manners on David Speedie in 1989</a> but admit that doesn’t quite fit the bill of what we’re looking for here.

He will miss the three warm-up matches in August and September and the tournament opener against Fiji.</p> \n<p>The England hooker appeared before a three-man disciplinary committee in Coventry on Wednesday night having been cited for confronting his opposite number Jamie George and leading with his head. Although contact was minimal and there was no injury, or simulation from George, it was aggressive enough for the Saracens’ flanker Jacques Burger to intervene, grabbing Hartley by the top of his jersey and shoving him backwards.</p> \n<p>The citing commissioner felt that the act demanded a red card, although no action was taken on the field. Hartley pleaded guilty and with George not suffering an injury he might have expected his ban to be cut by half, as is customary when players do not contest a charge and show contrition. However, his poor disciplinary record worked against him. He is serving his fifth ban in the last three years and it means his career suspensions now amount to 54 weeks.</p> \n<p>The panel’s chairman, Sean Enright, said Hartley’s conduct had been unacceptable in a statement that lacked the emollience of the Rugby Football Union’s judicial officer Jeremy Summers’s remarks after the hooker was banned for three weeks in December for elbowing the Leicester centre Matt Smith. “The offence falls within the low entry point for striking with the head,” he said. “There was no significant injury to the other party, the opposition player was not removed from the field of play, and the incident did not affect the game. However, there cannot be any place in our game for this class of behaviour and that is why we have imposed this sanction.”</p> \n<p>Hartley has established himself as England’s first-choice hooker, not least because of his ability in the set-pieces, but Stuart Lancaster is said to be angry with the hooker’s latest disciplinary issue.</p> \n<p>The England head coach will have to draft in another hooker to cover for Hartley’s absence in the warm-ups and he knows naming him in the 31-strong squad for the World Cup would be a risk, and not just because of the player’s disciplinary track record.</p> \n<p>Lancaster will pick three hookers. If Hartley is among them and one of the other two is injured before the Fiji match, England would not have a hooker on the bench. The second encounter is against Wales and Hartley would be an unlikely starter, not having played for four months, although his suspension covers only games and he would be free to play a full part in training sessions.</p> \n<p>Despite pleading guilty, Hartley has the right to appeal against the length of his sentence, which would have been a week more than he had budgeted for and one that may have significant implications for him. As World Cup hosts, England cannot afford the embarrassment of going into the opening match of the tournament without a recognised hooker among the replacements.</p> \n<p>Hartley has served five bans during Lancaster’s time in charge of England. The head coach has defended his player, refusing to say after December’s three-week ban for elbowing the Leicester centre Matt Smith that the hooker was down to his last chance. But with his World Cup plans now needing revision, he may take a different view. It is possible we may hear that view when Lancaster speaks to the media on Friday before England’s match against the Barbarians at Twickenham.</p> \n<p>The feeling coming out of headquarters is that the latest incident has aroused more ire than disappointment. Hartley confronted George after Northampton had scored a try and there was no element of provocation. It was a needless act and any damage to his career will be self-inflicted.</p> \n<p>Matt Dawson, a former Northampton scrum-half and a World Cup winner with England in 2003, said that picking Hartley in the World Cup squad would be a risk.</p> \n<p>“He could let them down big style,” he said. “Dylan is a great lad off the field but on it there is something missing. He has got a switch that goes. When you are involved in heated World Cup matches – and England have two of them in their group against Australia and Wales – you are playing against players who know how to flick that switch. His way of dealing with those scenarios could prove costly.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/27/1432761365122/Dylan-Hartley-has-been-ha-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dylan Hartley has been handed a month-long ban for striking an opponent with his head in the Premiership play-off semi-final against Saracens.

That figure is understood to be close to &pound;400,000 a year.</p> \n<p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Lawson added that along with the money, Bayliss was also drawn by the opportunity to be reunited with the England assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, whom he worked alongside with Sri Lanka six years ago. “A major factor is Farbrace. They’ve got a very good working relationship and Trevor likes to have people around him he knows he can trust and knows what they can produce,” Lawson said. “And they made him a very good offer.”</p> \n<p>Farbrace will continue to operate as England’s interim coach until the arrival of Bayliss late next month and took charge of training at Headingley on Wednesday, when England looked to loosen up after their thrilling 124-run win at Lord’s in time for Friday’s second Test against New Zealand.</p> \n<p>Joe Root was delighted to be back at what the vice-captain and Yorkshire batsman calls “the real home of cricket” and revealed there is excitement among the squad about the arrival of the Australian after being given the lowdown from Farbrace.</p> \n<p>“I have never met Trevor but I have heard a lot of good stuff about him,” Root said. “Farby knows him very well and speaks very highly of him so we’re looking forward to getting him over and meeting him. He has obviously got a fantastic record with the sides he has worked with.”</p> \n<p>Speaking about the prospect of having an Australian in charge for the Ashes, Root added: “I think [nine] of the Australia squad he’s worked with before in New South Wales so that obviously will be a slight advantage.”</p> \n<p>More pressing for England is the second Test, when a draw would secure victory in the two-match series and mean Alastair Cook’s side jump two places to third in the ICC rankings, behind Australia and the top side, South Africa.</p> \n<p>Root is mindful that England’s previous Test win – the nine-wicket victory over West Indies in Grenada – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/03/west-indies-beat-england-five-wickets\" title=\"\">was followed by defeat in Barbados,</a> which resulted in the series ending in a draw, an outcome that ultimately cost Moores his job.</p> \n<p>“That was such a disappointing game in Barbados because of the one hour we were poor,” Root said. “It is about making sure small periods of play don’t cost us and trying to limit them to as few as possible. Fingers crossed Lord’s was not just a one‑off and it is the start of us moving forwards as a side.”</p> \n<p>Much of the attention during the three‑day turnaround between Test matches has been on Ben Stokes, who followed scores of 92 and 101 with the bat and figures of three for 38 in the fourth innings at Lord’s by scoring the winning goal in England’s pre-training game of football on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Root sees the 23-year-old Durham all-rounder remaining unaffected by the hype. “The thing about Ben is, every time he pulls on the shirt he gives absolutely everything,” he said. “I don’t think that is going to change.</p> \n<p>“When he is bowling, he will run in until he barely can’t move any more.

Well, the Croatian with a history that might have been ripped from the pages of a penny dreadful will have to make room for another remarkable episode in her epic dialogue with the Romanian.</p> \n<p>To the amazement of everyone but herself on Court Suzanne Lenglen on Wednesday, Lucic-Baroni overpowered the No3 seed and 2014 finalist even more convincingly than at the US Open to reach the third round against the French player Aliz&eacute; Cornet – 16 years after her debut at Roland Garros, when she had no hyphen in her name but a thousand stars in her eyes.</p> \n<p>Lucic had won the girls’ title in Australia and New York before she was 14, putting her alongside Martina Hingis and Jennifer Capriati. She reached the third round of the US Open in 1998 and the semi-final at Wimbledon a year later, and it took a prime Steffi Graf to stop her. But financial and personal problems forced her to quit tennis in 2003 for four years, and she later revealed her father had abused her as a child. The youthful vim seemed gone for good.</p> \n<p>However, renewed in love (she added her husband’s name to hers when they married in 2010), she embraced tennis again. Of course life is not a fairytale, and 2015 has been tough, like so many years before.</p> \n<p>She reached the second round in Brisbane and the quarters in Acapulco. Then she went out at the first time of asking in Hobart, the Australian Open, Antwerp, Dubai (as a qualifier), Indian Wells, Miami, Charleston, Prague and Madrid (again after qualifying). In Rome, she went out in qualifying.</p> \n<p>Now, back in the sunshine of her autumnal years at 33, back in the big time for a moment or two, she told fans still standing and cheering in their seats on Wednesday: “I’m so proud of myself. It’s such a huge win. Amazing”.</p> \n<p>“I hope at least three French people will cheer for me against [Cornet] next match, then I’ll be happy. I’ll enjoy it, like I’ve been doing.”</p> \n<p>Halep, who had a blistered finger taped in the first set, looked to favour her right ankle briefly after falling in the second, but Lucic-Baroni’s fierce hitting and artful court strategy played a bigger part in the Romanian’s downfall.</p> \n<p>Even with her right wrist, shoulder and biceps heavily strapped, the Croatian hit four aces, outserving Halep by 22kph at her fastest and leaving her stranded with flat, precise groundstrokes to win 7-5, 6-1. She struck seven winners on her forehand in the final set, two more than Halep managed on either wing in the wholematch, and the 29 she hit in the 71 minutes the match lasted blew Halep off court.</p> \n<p>Lucic-Baroni may not get past Cornet. She may return to losing in obscure places to players known only to their friends and family. But, for now, she has the biggest smile in Paris.</p> \n<p>Halep, who heads straight for Birmingham ahead of Wimbledon, said: “I lost. It’s not the end of the world. She played very well, hit very strong. It was difficult because I didn’t have a good feeling about the game. I can accept this, it’s tennis.”</p> \n<p>There were a couple of other minor rarities spotted on Lenglen: Roger Federer, who sets up camp on the centre court of most slam events – and the Swiss hitting a two-handed backhand lob for 15-0 against Marcel Granollers in the seventh game of their third and deciding set.</p> \n<p>Not much else about the match was out of character and Federer held to love for 5-2, as an otherwise entertaining match ended limply, Granollers shoving a backhand return into the net after an hour and 47 minutes to hand Federer a 6-2, 7-6, 6-3 win.</p> \n<p>The world No2 next plays the 5ft 9in Bosnian Damir Dzumhur, who upset the Cypriot veteran Marcos Baghdatis 6-4, 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 in two hours and 24 minutes. Federer said: “I might even go so far to say I have actually almost never seen him play.”</p> \n<p>Dzumhur, 88 in the world, saw it differently: “He is probably the biggest player ever in tennis, and I’m really glad I have the chance to play with him. That is probably the dream of every player.”</p> \n<p>Or, on the day, a nice sort of nightmare.</p> \n<p>Hours after her win, Lucic-Baroni reflected on her journey and on coincidence.</p> \n<p>“When I saw the draw and I saw who I was playing second round, I knew it was going to be really tough,” she said. “I was going to have to play a great match again and back up what I did at the US Open. People say, ’Oh, it’s one day everything went in,’ and I don’t look at it like that. I know I played really well.</p> \n<p>“The US Open was the first time in a long time that I’d had a really good result like that. So I was extremely emotional. Everything just kind of hit me at once. Now, after seeing the video of my press conference a few times, I’m trying to hold it together a bit better. No, I don’t hide my emotion.</p> \n<p>This is who I am. And I was really so happy I shed a few tears today on the court, as well.”</p> \n<p>She revealed she’d been asked a few times to write her life story. “I feel until it’s the end, really the end, and if it goes kind of the way I would like it to go, maybe one day.”</p> \n<p>Lucic-Baroni, a keen student of history who grew up among architectural ruins of Croatia, is aware that her story has a logical end point and that there is no erasing some of her glorious past.</p> \n<p>“I’m very proud of the things I achieved when I was so young. I was a little kid. When you’re a little kid... it’s amazing to me when I look at young kids, 150 [in the rankings] and improving. It’s a lot of pressure.</p> \n<p>It’s not easy to do that. When I remember what I did … I’m very proud of that little girl, yeah.”</p> \n<p>And what she will always remain is the girl from Croatia who created such a stir as a teenager, and another one when she reappeared from nowhere, her life rebuilt.</p> \n<p>“I was born in Germany. I lived in Croatia until I was 16. My parents are Croatian. I am 100% Croatian, through and through. I think my temper proves that. We are stubborn, we are tough, we are fighters. Sometimes it can be little negative being temperamental, but I’m very proud of where I come from and who I am.</p> \n<p>“Then living in States, the greatest country in the world, there is so much freedom and there is so much acceptance. I respect that. I miss really good salami and cheese – but my husband’s restaurant, that’s good.</p> \n<p>“I also miss a little bit of culture. That’s why I love coming to Europe.</p> \n<p>My favourite city is Rome. My husband [Daniele] is Italian. My sister also married an Italian, so we have two in the house and my mom said to our third sister: ’Please, just don’t bring another Italian in the house. Three Italians would be too much’.”</p> \n<p>Some things remain private. Asked to pinpoint the moment the bad times turned to good, she paused and said: “That’s kind of a difficult question. The day I left Croatia was 24 July, 1998. I left my family, and I was able to have peace and love. I was able to live with my [new] family, really happy. I think that was when everything went good for me.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/27/1432748044968/Mirjana-Lucic-Baroni-Fren-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mirjana Lucic-Baroni celebrates beating No3 seed Simona Halep in round two of the French Open at Roland Garros.

He also suffered a heart attack in 2009.</p> \n<p>King, signed for &pound;35,000 in 1976 by Billy Bingham after only 33 games for Luton Town, was immediately embraced by the Goodison Park faithful at what was a difficult period for the club. The midfielder’s stock rose higher after he scored <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcL3wNZHVM8\" title=\"\">a stunning winning goal against Liverpool in 1978</a> to give Everton their first victory in a Merseyside derby for seven years.</p> \n<p>He joined QPR in 1980 having lost his way under the manager Gordon Lee but returned to Goodison two years later in a swap deal with West Bromwich Albion for the forward Peter Eastoe arranged by the new Everton manager Howard Kendall. A serious knee injury hindered his second spell at Goodison and he moved to the Dutch side Cambuur Leeuwarden just as Everton’s successful period of the mid-1980s commenced.</p> \n<p>King, who had played twice for England Under-21s, later had playing spells with Wolverhampton Wanderers and Luton among others before managing Mansfield Town and Swindon Town, where he had two spells in charge. He also coached at Sunderland alongside his former Everton team-mate Peter Reid and has been working as chief scout for MK Dons.</p> \n<p>King took over as caretaker manager of Northampton following Aidy Boothroyd’s departure in late 2013 but returned to scouting with MK Dons two months later.</p> \n<p>A statement on the Dons’ club website, said: “Milton Keynes Dons Football Club are devastated to learn that chief scout Andy King has suddenly passed away at the age of 58.</p> \n<p>“He passed away suddenly after a heart attack at his home on Wednesday.

The Scottish canoeist knows all about crushing disappointments and heartbreak having missed out on the London Olympics despite being the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/apr/07/olympic-games-canoeing-fiona-pennie\" title=\"\">strongest Briton in the K1 slalom category</a>. The scars were deep, the memories remain vivid.</p> \n<p>The qualification process was ruthless and even reflecting on it now brings a certain pain. Instead of awarding the solitary Team GB spot to the most consistent performer over a prolonged spell, the paddlers faced off against each other in three races across a weekend four months before the Games.</p> \n<p>In a winner-takes-all scenario, one mistake in the space of a few minutes and all the work that went before could go up in smoke. Being the favourite and most successful in the run-up meant nothing.</p> \n<p>Pennie was beaten at Lee Valley by Lizzie Neave, a friend as much as a rival. There is a striking image from the immediate aftermath when a jubilant Neave partakes in various media duties while Pennie passes by in the background with an inconsolable look etched across her face. All that work, those endless hours on the water and in the gym, did not produce the desired result. “It didn’t go very well for me,” she concedes now, pausing for reflection. “I made crucial errors but let’s just say it wasn’t my weekend. It was hard to take at the time but I bounced back … eventually.”</p> \n<p>Her use of “eventually” implies a lengthy postmortem, a spell of deep introspection and an attempt to understand where it all went wrong. Not quite. “Three weeks after missing out I was third in the Euros, so that helped me get the disappointment out of my system,” she says. “And I won the Europeans the following year, so I’ve a history of bouncing back. I tend to use those disappointments as a motivational tool.”</p> \n<p>Pennie has eight medals from world and European championships and her tale has not yet been fully told. The happy ending may still arrive. She knows how to recover and this summer, as the cycle comes full circle, she will attempt to qualify for next year’s Olympics.</p> \n<p>The 32-year-old may have missed out on the chance of being a host participant but Rio gives her a shot at redemption. How sweet it will taste if she can qualify at the end of a season which also includes the European championships this weekend and the world championships in September.</p> \n<p>There is, however, a twist in the qualification process. Starting with a medal in Germany this weekend, where Pennie will take to the water on Friday afternoon, would be a big help. “If you medal at the European championships and also at the world championships, and nobody else within your team comes in the top 10, you automatically get the place,” she explains. “If that doesn’t select one person, we will have those three selection races at the end of October. Your best two races count and whoever wins gets the qualification space.”</p> \n<p>It is difficult to think of another sport where you spend so much time being team-mates but when it comes to reaching the greatest stage those who you train, eat and often share a room with are the opposition. “It’s an odd environment,” Pennie admits. “We’re team-mates for the rest of the cycle. You’re working alongside each other but against each other at the same time. You want to do well for your team but also for yourself.</p> \n<p>“We all get on but there’s a rivalry, too,” she adds. “You have to gel as a team. You’re always pushing each other and it’s a natural competition but at the same time we get the same funding; we’re using the same services and information in the exact same way. It’s very different to a lot of sports. We don’t work as individuals but it is, essentially, an individual sport.”</p> \n<p>There remains a purity to Pennie’s approach despite the disappointments. Even after the heartache, her enthusiasm shows no sign of waning but as one of the leading names in her sport in Britain does she not sometimes crave more attention? For the vast majority, after all, canoeing is perceived as a niche pursuit which you might catch a glimpse of every four years – even if participation numbers have increased since London.</p> \n<p>“I don’t do it for a profile,” Pennie says. “If you ask anybody at the top of their sport – even those with high profiles – they’ll say they’re only doing it for the love of it. If you don’t enjoy it, it’d be a very difficult job to do every day. Obviously, it would be nice to be out there a bit more but I go canoeing, I enjoy my sport and that’s all that matters.” That, plus a successful campaign.</p> \n<p><em>National Go Canoeing Week is taking place across England until 31 May.
