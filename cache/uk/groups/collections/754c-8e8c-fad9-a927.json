Waiting for him in Germany will be the side that twice beat Manchester United in the final and the man who was banned for eight games for racially abusing him while playing for Liverpool after the teams met in the Premier League in October 2011. Evra insisted that the battle between them will be restricted to the game itself.</p> \n<p>“It doesn’t matter; the most important thing is that I play in the final,” Evra said. “I am proud to be what I am, I am proud about my colour, and I will shake his hand, it is no problem. But I will make sure he will feel me on the pitch.”</p> \n<p>Su&aacute;rez is also set to come up against the Juventus defender Giorgio Chiellini, whom he bit in a World Cup match last summer while playing for Uruguay against Italy. Su&aacute;rez was punished with a nine-match suspension from international matches and a four-month ban from all football-related activities.</p> \n<p>Juventus knocked out Real Madrid 3-2 on aggregate to reach the final and Evra said that the unexpected nature of that result means that while Barcelona are the favourites, Juve will travel to their first final in 12 years believing that they can beat the Catalans. The full-back described it as “David versus Goliath,” but then few expected the Italian club to even get this far.</p> \n<p>“Of course, of course [we can beat them]”, Evra said. “They are human beings. People forget [that] on Juventus’ team [there are] a lot of players [who] have already won the Champions League. There are players who have played in [other] finals, like myself. This is my fifth final. You never know. I believe in everything because if I didn’t believe we can win against Barcelona, I would ask the manager not to play me.”</p> \n<p>“It’s going to be a tough game, David versus Goliath. But you never know. In football anything can happen. In Monaco we had our most difficult game, and against Madrid everyone thought they would win. That is where you see the great character and personality of the Juventus players.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/13/real-madrid-juventus-champions-league-semi-final-match-report\">Real Madrid 1-1 Juventus (Juventus win 3-2 on agg) | Champions League semi-final second leg match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Evra added: “Barcelona is still Barcelona. I think against Manchester [United in 2009 and 2011] they were more a team, a very strong team,” he continued. “Now they have three players in the front, Messi, Neymar and Su&aacute;rez, that can make the difference. You can be strong like in the last five, 10 minutes [against Madrid] but these three players can score any time. You have to be ready.</p> \n<p>“We worked really hard [for this]. You have to congratulate the boss because tactically he’s really, really good. Game by game we believed we could do something big this year. I don’t know if people believed we’d make the final.

ending Kevin Pietersen’s hopes of an international return and the confirmation that Alastair Cook will continue as Test captain this summer.</p> \n<p>Both of those decisions, along with Joe Root’s promotion to vice-captain, were made public by Strauss on Tuesday following his appointment as the director of England cricket but, crucially, were made without input from the person who will replace the dismissed Peter Moores.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/13/yorkshire-jason-gillespie-england-hampshire\">Yorkshire’s Jason Gillespie stays quiet amid mounting England links</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Gillespie was confirmed as a candidate by Strauss and is the frontrunner for the vacancy after masterminding Yorkshire’s title win last season. But while the 40-year-old Australian remains open to talks – no official approach has yet been made – it is understood he will now need convincing that the job still wields sufficient power in the light of such decisions.</p> \n<p>Removing the ability to consider Pietersen for selection this summer – a stance that has been made non-negotiable by the England and Wales Cricket Board – and the early call on Cook continuing in the Test role certainly makes the job a harder sell for Strauss, and he must persuade applicants they will still have a say in future big decisions.</p> \n<p>Obeying diktats from on high is not how things work at Headingley, where the former fast bowler has full control over first-team matters alongside the captain, Andrew Gale. The director of cricket, Martyn Moxon, is in charge of the overall structure of the club but gets involved in selection only when a casting vote is required.</p> \n<p>Gillespie, who normally speaks after Yorkshire’s matches, was shielded from the media on Wednesday after his side’s 305‑run win over Hampshire, and Moxon instead fielded questions on the future of his coach.</p> \n<p>Moxon confirmed England have held off from talks while Yorkshire’s match was in progress. The club have been assured discussions will be handled in the “correct manner” when the expected approach comes.</p> \n<p>While Yorkshire would demand compensation from the ECB for Gillespie’s services, it is understood his recently agreed contract to coach Adelaide Strikers in the Australia’s Big Bash League later this year – a role he had planned to run in conjunction with his job in county cricket – includes a break clause should he be offered an international position.</p> \n<p>England’s assistant coach Paul Farbrace, who worked with Gillespie at Yorkshire, will run the team in a caretaker role for the New Zealand series. While he will be retained, both he and Strauss agree he is not a likely candidate for the main job.</p> \n<p>The ECB has chosen to remain silent on accusations of “lies” and “deceit” by Pietersen following Monday evening’s meeting with Strauss, leaving Colin Graves exposed to such questioning when he finally assumes the role of chairman at Thursday’s annual general meeting at Lord’s.</p> \n<p>Pietersen, who struck a career-best of 355 not out against Leicestershire but spent Wednesday off the field with an achilles problem, used his Daily Telegraph column to hit out at the board following early-season encouragement to secure a county deal by Graves, which led him to join Surrey rather than play for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League.</p> \n<p>Pietersen accused Graves of “leading him down the garden path” while similarly savaging the ECB chief executive, Tom Harrison, for arranging the meeting with Strauss despite previously telling him he wanted no such talks if it was simply to reiterate his continued exile from the national team. Pietersen added that his return to India, scheduled for Friday, would be a chance to plan his next move but the injury rules him out for two weeks and thereby the rest of the IPL.</p> \n<p>The Pietersen affair and the bungled sacking of Moores last weekend will no doubt be discussed behind the scenes at the AGM in which the departing chairman, Giles Clarke, will officially hand over to Graves before moving into the newly created position of ECB president.Clarke, who will continue to represent English cricket at the International Cricket Council, is expected to give a valedictory speech that thanks his fellow board members for their support during his eight years in charge and hails Graves ahead of his five-year term that begins on Friday.</p> \n<p>He will also use the opportunity to warn them about the threat of ’rebel’ cricket and the plans of Indian conglomerate Essel to create a breakaway form of the game that are understood to include the creation of an unofficial Twenty20 tournament.</p> \n<p>Following his speech, a statement from Clarke will be published, in what will be his first official comment on the subject in his ICC capacity, with Essel-owned broadcasters Ten Sports – who have the rights to show home internationals in five Test-playing countries – also in the crosshairs over their involvement.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/13/kevin-pietersen-public-opinion-trust-ecb\">Kevin Pietersen, not the ECB, is where the public now put their trust | Owen Gibson</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431545681856/Jason-Gillespie-Yorkshire-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jason Gillespie, the Yorkshire coach, has full control over first-team matters alongside the captain, Andrew Gale, at Headingley.

Four straight victories, including Sunday’s 6-0 win against Queens Park Rangers, have improved perceptions of this season and the squad, after the spring wobbles which included 1-0 away defeats to a Lionel Messi-inspired Barcelona and Burnley, and losing 4-2 in the derby to Manchester United.</p> \n<p>The end-of-season reviews, a routine practice of City’s Abu Dhabi-based chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, will nevertheless analyse the club’s recent recruitment and aim to improve on it this summer. Since the summer of 2013, under the two former Barcelona executives Begiristain and Soriano, City have spent around &pound;141m on Eliaquim Mangala, Jes&uacute;s Navas, &Aacute;lvaro Negredo, Stevan Jovetic, Fernando and Fernandinho, before January’s &pound;28m signing of Wilfried Bony, none of whom are widely considered to have made an improvement worth the outlay of cash.</p> \n<p>Before Begiristain arrived, Brian Marwood, the former Arsenal winger, Professional Footballers’ Association chairman and Nike employee, had in effect done City’s director of football job. He believed in retaining a core of English players, alongside signings that included Yaya Tour&eacute; for &pound;24m in 2010, David Silva for &pound;26m the same summer, Sergio Ag&uuml;ero for &pound;38m in 2011, and other mainstays of the 2012 and 2014 Premier League-winning squads.</p> \n<p>Yet City are also mindful of the 2012 summer, when they declined to sign Robin van Persie, who then won the title with United, and instead bought Jack Rodwell, Scott Sinclair, Javi Garc&iacute;a and an ageing Maicon, players all wanted by the then manager, Roberto Mancini, but now seen to have not been of the required calibre. Modern football’s transfer dealings are recognised to be inherently unpredictable, with agents and ownership issues having to be negotiated. The Begiristain signings now under scrutiny, due to a season without a trophy and the Champions League exit to Barcelona, are at least considered close to top rank.</p> \n<p>The stand-out question mark, of course, is the one against Mangala. Club sources have confirmed that City paid &pound;42m last summer for the then 23-year-old, whom Porto had signed for &pound;4.7m from Standard Li&egrave;ge three years earlier, and who had played in four friendlies for France.</p> \n<p>In December 2011 Porto had sold one-third of Mangala’s economic rights for around &pound;1.8m to Doyen Sports, an investment fund registered in Malta, which has anonymous investors. So, when Begiristain and the City board plumped for Mangala as their best prospect for the crucial position of centre-back, Doyen Sports received &pound;14m of the total &pound;42m, a &pound;12.2m net profit in two and a half years to the unknown investors.</p> \n<p>Another 10% of Mangala, which was bought out, because third-party ownership of players is banned in the Premier League, was owned by a company called Robi Plus, registered in England. The sole director is Mauricio Delmenico, a Swiss resident. Robi Plus received &pound;4.2m of the &pound;42m and now, without having filed its 2013-14 accounts, Delmenico has applied for the company to be struck off the register. Adbell International, the accountancy firm presenting the striking out application, did not respond to questions about it from the Guardian.</p> \n<p>City had already dealt with Doyen in Begiristain’s first summer transfer window, 2013, when the club signed Navas and Negredo from the Spanish club Sevilla for a combined &pound;34.9m. Sevilla were in financial difficulties, like many Spanish clubs below the two giants, Barcelona and Real Madrid, who devour so much La Liga TV money. Doyen began to provide funding for Sevilla and other clubs, mostly in exchange for promising players’ economic rights, and in 2012-13 Doyen Sports became the sponsor of Sevilla.</p> \n<p>Neither Navas nor Negredo, both Spain internationals, are understood to have been part-owned by Doyen but the latter was represented by Doyen. It announced on 17 October 2013 that the Negredo transfer was one of its deals in a “busy summer” which also included Geoffrey Kondogbia’s move from Sevilla to Monaco, Radamel Falcao’s from Atl&eacute;tico Madrid to Monaco, and Kak&aacute;’s, from Real Madrid to Milan.</p> \n<p>The agent acting on Mangala’s move was the ubiquitous Portuguese dealmaker Jorge Mendes, whose extraordinary summer 2014 included &Aacute;ngel Di Mar&iacute;a’s and Falcao’s moves to Manchester United, James Rodr&iacute;guez going to Real Madrid and Diego Costa signing for Chelsea. The &pound;42m City paid for Mangala did not include Mendes’s agent’s fee. Clubs do not disclose individual agent’s fees, only the total paid in a year; in 2013-14 City paid &pound;12.8m in total to agents, third highest after Chelsea, who paid &pound;16.8m, and Liverpool, &pound;14.3m.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, Mendes was not the agent in City’s &pound;12m purchase of Fernando last summer, despite coming from Porto, Mendes’s original base of influence. The Brazilian midfielder, who has played in all four of City’s consecutive recent victories and made 22 starts this season, was represented by another Portuguese agent, Ant&oacute;nio Ara&uacute;jo. His agency, Onsoccer, owned 20% of Fernando’s economic rights, so was paid &pound;2.4m out of the &pound;12m City paid for the player.</p> \n<p>Fernandinho, the Brazil midfielder signed in the summer of 2013, generally reckoned to have been the best-performing of the players bought under Begiristain, was 28. City paid &pound;30m for him to Shakhtar Donetsk, the Ukrainian club where a number of Brazilian players are signed, hoping for a big-money move to one of Europe’s major leagues. Fernandinho’s agent, unusually, is a woman, Daisy Brandino, who gained her early experience as a banker for wealthy private clients at a Swiss bank in Zurich.</p> \n<p>Jovetic, who has made 43 appearances, including as a substitute, since City paid &pound;22m for him in summer 2013, came from Fiorentina, as did the centre-back Matija Nastasic, who was signed the previous summer before Begiristain arrived, when Roberto Mancini was City’s coach. Jovetic and Nastasic, who is on loan to the German club Schalke, are understood to have been represented by the same agent, well known in the Balkans, Fali Ramadani.</p> \n<p>When these signings and their performances are assessed by Mubarak, a senior Abu Dhabi political and business figure, the outcome is not expected to be damning. There is likely to be a recognition that football itself has changed since Sheikh Mansour’s &pound;1.152bn investment in City fuelled the club’s rise and ability to sign elite players; fees are expensive and competition fierce among the top Champions League-competing clubs. Although &pound;42m looks a very high figure to have paid for Mangala, he is still only 24 and has time to improve.</p> \n<p>The result of their recruitment is that City now have several players expected to be offered for sale or exchange this summer, while the club targets a select few top players, including Paul Pogba from Juventus and Kevin De Bruyne from Wolfsburg, who they believe can make a stronger impact for Pellegrini.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431542758001/Manuel-Pellegrini-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Maunel Pellegrini's performance will be reviewed by the club's hierarchy.

His confidence and poise were <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/13/andy-murray-clay-jeremy-chardy-italian-open\" title=\"\">too much for the erratic Frenchman J&eacute;r&eacute;my Chardy</a> on Wednesday, lending strength to the view that the Scot is playing the best clay-court tennis of his life less than a fortnight before the French Open.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, Murray readjusted the assessment of his chances of winning in Paris – where he has reached two semi-finals – upward to: “It’s not impossible.” He paused, adding: “Maybe this year will be different, I’ll go in there thinking there’s a chance.”</p> \n<p>Murray’s dilemma when he arrived at the Foro Italico for his 10th Rome Masters after an unprecedented run of nine wins in two clay tournaments over 10 days, including a two-set <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/10/andy-murray-overwhelms-rafael-nadal-to-win-madrid-open-title\" title=\"\">thumping of Rafael Nadal in the final of the Madrid Open</a> last Sunday, was to fine-tune his game in conditions more akin to Roland Garros or rest and prepare as he had planned to before this burst of exquisite clay form. He was concerned that playing three clay tournaments back to back for the first time before a slam might drain him for the gruelling fortnight to come in Paris, with the best of five sets ramping up the challenge.</p> \n<p>He will have his French mentor, the pregnant Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo, by his side there, and expanded on how he and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/26/andy-murray-jonas-bjorkman-coach\" title=\"\">his new assistant coach, Jonas Bjorkman</a>, will plan their schedule around her pregnancy.</p> \n<p>“Am&eacute;lie is going to do Paris and, during the grass, Jonas will do the start, the first couple of weeks,” he said. “Both of them will be at Wimbledon, providing Am&eacute;lie’s OK to do that, which she will decide. That’s why both of them will be there, just in case.</p> \n<p>“After Wimbledon, Jonas will be with me until the US Open, and probably through until Paris. I don’t know exactly what my schedule is going to be after the US Open but after Wimbledon I’m not planning on seeing Am&eacute;lie until she’s ready – which she thinks will be around the time of the Paris Masters in November.”</p> \n<p>Murray took only an hour and 24 minutes to account for Mauresmo’s compatriot Chardy, 6-4, 6-3, and could run into Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals; recent demons lurk there for Murray, whose last encounter with the world No1 ended in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/05/andy-murray-falls-to-novak-djokovic-again-in-miami-open-final\" title=\"\">a lightning third-set bagel in the semi-finals in Miami</a>. The tinkering has gone well but the Roman holiday is over.</p> \n<p>In testing rather than killing heat, Murray – with a split right thumb lightly taped – took every opportunity to shorten the exchanges with Chardy, his drop-shot lethal and his backhand the steady machine gun needed to keep his opponent pinned deep. Chardy was trapped for 20 minutes in his hotel lift earlier in the week and, after an hour longer than that here, he had hit the button for the basement.</p> \n<p>About the time his brother Jamie was going on Court No3 with his Australian doubles partner John Peers – they beat the fourth seeds Marcin Matkowski and Nenad Zimonjic 7-6 (7-4), 7-5 – Murray brought a decent workout to a pleasing conclusion.</p> \n<p>Marsel Ilhan, meanwhile, could do little more than swat at top-spun howitzers for an hour and a quarter as Nadal took his frustrations out on the Turkish qualifier, winning 6-2, 6-0. It is unlikely the Spaniard, chasing an eighth title here, will enjoy his next match so much: against the American John Isner, who beat the Argentinian Leonardo Mayer 7-6 (8-6), 6-4.</p> \n<p>Italy’s Fabio Fognini, owner of the best strut in sport, bageled the infuriatingly inconsistent Grigor Dimitrov at the end of a fascinating three-setter, and plays the sixth seed, Tomas Berdych, in the third round.</p> \n<p>Britain’s Heather Watson, who defeated Italy’s Roberta Vinci convincingly in her first match, lasted only another hour and seven minutes on Wednesday, the 10th seed, Carla Su&aacute;rez Navarro, rarely troubled in winning 6-1, 6-1.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431534449864/Andy-Murray-at-Rome-Maste-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Britain's Andy Murray is feeling confident about his chances in the forthcoming French Open.

Before I signed a national dual contract last year I had approaches from outside but I was never interested in joining a club in France or England: that would have meant playing 35 games a season and I know I could not produce that physically. I reckon that by staying here I will be able to play for two or three seasons longer.</p> \n<p>“<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jan/25/wales-sam-warburton-welsh-rugby-union-central-contract\" title=\"\">The dual contract helps with longevity and it works for Wales</a>, who can keep a close eye on you, the players, whose careers are managed well, and the regions, who keep their best players and get help with wages. I want to play for the Blues for as long as I can. I am 26 but I cannot see myself doing this for another nine years. I already have to use the handrail coming down the stairs after some games. I do worry what I will be like when I am 50 or 55.</p> \n<p>“I hope I will still be active and not need knee and hip replacements but the chances are I will face surgery in middle age.

I have told myself that I will not run a single metre after retiring but take up cycling to rest my knees. Some players will always want to experience rugby outside Wales, new cultures and environments, but I am different. I am where I want to be.”</p> \n<p>Warburton has enjoyed success at international level: two Six Nations titles and a grand slam, reaching the World Cup semi-final in 2011 and winning a series with the 2013 Lions, the first for 16 years. It has been different at regional level, one reason why some wondered before he signed his dual contract whether he would seek success at club level elsewhere. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/04/newport-gwent-dragons-cardiff-blues-challenge-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">The Blues will finish 10th in the Pro 12 this season</a>, below all the other non-Italian teams, and are looking for a new director of rugby after Mark Hammett left before the end of his first campaign in charge to return to New Zealand.</p> \n<p>“I was delighted to see [Wales and Lions team-mates] Leigh Halfpenny and Jonathan Davies play in this month’s Champions Cup final,” says Warburton. “Leigh is such a dedicated player that he deserves the winner’s medal hanging up in his house. I am envious of players who have won the European Cup and having done well at international level, it is something I would like to experience. Cardiff Blues won the Challenge Cup in 2010 but we have fallen away a bit since then.</p> \n<p>“I am a fan of the region, watching from the terraces when I was younger when the likes of Martyn Williams and Robin Sowden-Taylor were playing in my position. Nothing would be more satisfying than to win in Europe with the team I love and it would certainly mean more than doing it with another club. We can get there but it will require changes. A new director of rugby will be given three years to get things moving which is right. When I was growing up and watching the Blues we finished second in the league a few times and were one of the top sides, always having massive battles.</p> \n<p>I want us to get back to that level: Cardiff is the capital city of Wales and there is a lot of interest in rugby here. The fans are there but they want to watch a winning team. That is what we have to aspire to.”</p> \n<p>It has been different with Wales, who are regarded as one of the contenders for this year’s World Cup even though they are in a pool with the hosts, England, and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/08/wales-australia-autumn-international-match-report\" title=\"\">Australia, a team they have not beaten since 2008</a>. Wales were within a kick of making the 2011 final, losing to France by a point having played for an hour with 14 men after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/oct/15/wales-sam-warburton-france-rugby\" title=\"\">the dismissal of Warburton by the referee, Alain Rolland, for a dangerous tackle</a>. It was a decision that provoked outrage in Wales and beyond but the player is not held prisoner by the past.</p> \n<p>“What happened that day does not haunt me,” he says. “When it comes to preparing for an international I never worry about what other people can control. That includes referees and I never take it personally if they punish me. It was nothing personal that day. Rolland had sent someone off earlier in the year for tackling as I did and I should have known better going into the game. I blame myself for what happened and I learned the hard way. For a few months afterwards, I was concerned about what I was doing when I went into a tackle, but it has not crossed my mind since.</p> \n<p>“We are more experienced as a squad in 2015 than we were then. As captain now I am surrounded by proven leaders. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/29/wales-south-africa-autumn-international-match-report\" title=\"\">Beating South Africa in November was massive for us</a>. If we play them in the World Cup, we will remember that day. I know it was the end of their season and how tough it is for us going on tour in the summer, but we were desperate for a victory over one of the big southern hemisphere teams after coming so close for so long. I celebrated on the pitch when the final whistle went more than I had ever done before because of what it meant.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/12/sam-burgess-bath-england-world-cup\">Sam Burgess tells Stuart Lancaster he is ready for the World Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Warburton will have a month off after the weekend, going on holiday and resting, although not totally, before joining up with Wales (if selected, he points out) and going off to camp in Switzerland and the 50-degree heat of Qatar. “To finish third in the Six Nations was disappointing, but going into the summer we have won five of our last six Tests and had one bad half of rugby, against England,” he said. “The training will be really tough, as I know from experience, but we have a top group of coaches and staff and the players trust them completely. They know their stuff and we will be prepared come September.</p> \n<p>“We are in a demanding group but Wales, England and Australia are pretty level and you cannot predict how it will go. To do well, you need your world-class players to stand up and it is important that as a team you are on the same page. I want to win the World Cup but it will be almost as tough to win the group. We always find it difficult to beat Australia, and England have defeated us twice on the bounce, but we all have the ability to beat each other and it may come down to points difference. What the Six Nations showed is that European rugby is up there with the south, even if New Zealand are an exceptional side. I was as tired after the games against England and Ireland as I have been after battles with South Africa, Australia and the All Blacks. All bets are off.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431534445609/Sam-Warburton-Wales-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sam Warburton, the Wales captain, says: 'I already have to use the handrail coming down the stairs after some games.

He crumbled to the ground, needing treatment. Miraculously, the game started on time and Ongun officiated the match with five stitches in his head. It was as if the incident had never happened.</p> \n<p>Just a few months later another Turkish official, this time Kemal Yilmaz, stumbled to the ground after being hit by a stone during the Super League game between Diyarbakirspor and Bursaspor. Diyarbakirspor’s next match, at Belediyespor, was suspended after a pitch invasion as several supporters tried to hunt down and attack the referee. Huseyin Gocek and his assistants only just managed to avoid the approaching hate mob.</p> \n<p>That was 16 March, 2010, and, of course, it did not stop there.</p> \n<p>The list of awful moments to tarnish the Turkish game is long and, somewhere along the line, the severity of what was happening got worse. The violence grew even more horrific; the attacks even more gruesome.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae1add76e91b2e35cba2aa8a54cfe3cab1ddba44\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/7/1431001729310/1783d0a8-21ac-4840-9b1c-addf711fca83-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Bursaspor player hides from the objects thrown by Diyarbakirspor fans, as an injured assistant referee lays on the pitch, during the Super League soccer match in Diyarbakir in March 2010.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Bursaspor player hides from the objects thrown by Diyarbakirspor fans, as an injured assistant referee lays on the pitch, during the Super League soccer match in Diyarbakir in March 2010.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ho New/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>During the 1. League game between Mersin Idmanyurdu and Samsunspor on 14 September 2010, the coach of Idmanyurdu, Yuksel Yesilova, was stabbed six times on the pitch. Somehow he survived. The next victim, however, was not as lucky. On 13 May 2013, Burak Yildirim, a 19-year-old student, was stabbed to death on the day of an Istanbul derby, just because he was wearing a Fenerbahce shirt.</p> \n<p>Seven months later and the former Everton player Manuel Fernandes was kicked to the ground by a pitch invader during the Besiktas-Kasimpasa game. Then Galatasaray’s forward Burak Yilmaz suffered a serious face injury when he was hit by a pocket knife thrown from the stands of Rize Sehir Stadium.</p> \n<p>In most other countries it would take just one or two of those incidents for the country’s football association to suspend play and start looking for ways of dealing with the problem. Not in Turkey. In Turkey it needed a gunman to attack the Fenerbahce team bus before anyone reacted.</p> \n<p>On 4 April 2015, in Trabzon, just a few hours after the win against Rizespor, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/apr/04/fenerbahce-team-bus-attacked\" title=\"\">the Fener bus was shot at</a>. Ufuk Kiran, the driver of the bus with 41 passengers on, suffered facial injuries. Drenched in blood, he somehow succeeded in keeping the bus, which was going at 100kmph, on the road. If Kiran had lost consciousness, the bus would have fallen off a cliff, and 42 people, including former Premier League players such as Dirk Kuyt and Emre Bel&ouml;zoğlu, would not be alive today.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8285532f9ee0100af10a1163d8d3af22ca942b18\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/7/1431001868851/edab0533-9157-4f77-bd92-12833f13765b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Galatasaray fans light flares to celebrate their goal against Fenerbahce during the game on 6 April 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Galatasaray fans light flares to celebrate their goal against Fenerbahce during the game on 6 April 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After the shooting, a committee including the minister of sports, Cagatay Kilic, and the president of Turkish Football Federation, Yildirim Demiroren, met in Istanbul to discuss what action to take. In the end the TFF decided to suspend the Super League for one week, a decision that was insufficient from the beginning and made even more hollow by the fact that the game between Besiktas and Basaksehir was allowed to take place that same night and that the lower leagues were allowed to carry on playing.</p> \n<p>No one will be surprised to find out that the violence, together with the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2011/jul/07/turkey-match-fixing\" title=\"\">match-fixing scandal</a> in the summer of 2011, has led to attendances falling. Thousands of fans have turned their back on the game. During the 2008-09 season the average attendance was around 14,000 but that had fallen to 9,000 last season.</p> \n<p>The supporters, referees and even players feel unsafe in our stadiums. The Juventus manager, Massimiliano Allegri, said recently that only <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/apr/27/juventus-max-allegri-torino-crowd-trouble-serie-a-madman-kids-football-stadiums\" title=\"\">“a madman would take children to a football game in Italy”</a> and it is a similar situation in Turkey, only worse.</p> \n<p>So what can be done? What must be done?</p> \n<p>There are two things. First of all, there needs to be punishments that fit the crime. Any guesses what happened to Mustafa Ozel, the hooligan who ran on to the pitch and kicked Fernandes in 2013? Lifetime ban? Ten years? No, the court banned him for one year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3123660d5031f8c6b00717295289674807f7dc0c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/7/1431002113447/90f2aeba-10a3-4ee7-84cd-0415e582f7f4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Players react after a supporter ran on to the pitch to kick Besiktas' Manuel Fernandes during the game against Kasimpasaspor.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Players react after a supporter ran on to the pitch to kick Besiktas’ Manuel Fernandes during the game against Kasimpasaspor.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Today, two years from the attack, he is free to walk into any stadium and watch any game, all because of the insufficiencies of Law 6,222, that deals with prevention of violence in sport in Turkey.</p> \n<p>The second action that is required is for the TFF to update its disciplinary sanctions so that it can deal with provocative club presidents, who do nothing to deal with the problems surrounding their clubs.</p> \n<p>In fact, in some instances, they incite their fans. Last month, one club president, Aziz Yildirim, told the media: “If the referee Ozgur Yankaya officiates a game of our team one more time, he probably won’t get out of the stadium that easily.”</p> \n<p>Of course Yankaya has not officiated a match in Kadikoy again. And how did the TFF deal with the president? He was banned from watching his team live for 60 days. That is it. Sad, but true.</p> \n<p>So there is the potential for it to get worse before it gets better. Foreign stars such as Demba Ba and Moussa Sow may join the Feyenoord-bound Kuyt in leaving the league in the summer and who can blame them? In the meantime, we are left to pick up the pieces from an awful season. Chaos is bound to happen in places where law is not enforced.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b825cc4502471f74f4ea978d2711230403a77209\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431516473493/fe3d8df0-0d5c-4b89-bcf2-4f5a83b17b4d-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Turkish policemen protect Galatasaray's players after their victory over Fenerbahce at the end of their  match at Sukru Saracoglu Stadium in Istanbul in May 2012.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkish policemen protect Galatasaray’s players after their victory over Fenerbahce at the end of their match at Sukru Saracoglu Stadium in Istanbul in May 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As long as a criminal is not sentenced properly, that person may well repeat the act.</p> \n<p>I do not know what the sports authorities are waiting for in order to take serious action against the violence. Twenty-two players to be shot dead during a football game? A Heysel-style tragedy? We really do not have any idea.</p> \n<p>In the meantime we are left trying to carry on loving a game that can give us so much pleasure, but that is slowly dying while everyone just stands there watching.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ugurmeleke\" title=\"\"><em>Ugur Meleke</em></a><em> is a football columnist at </em><a href=\"http://www.milliyet.com.tr/\" title=\"\"><em>Milliyet</em></a><em>.
