Sunlit Lord’s, chattering crowd, shirtsleeve order in the pavilion, flags hanging lifeless on the poles, and in the middle a contest to savour to start the international summer. Mid-May pitches in St John’s Wood always carry a green tinge at the start, spring sappiness still. This was no exception and if it changed colour chameleon-like as the day wore on, then so did the nature of the cricket.</p> \n<p>At the end of an absorbing day the scoreboard tells of England, having been put into bat by Brendon McCullum, making 354 for seven and rattling along for the most part at four runs per over throughout. That, though, gives only the bare bones of the drama that unfolded. After 13 overs of the day there were 30 runs on the board and Adam Lyth, on his debut, Gary Ballance, Alastair Cook and Ian Bell back in the dressing room, victims to the trio of New Zealand pacemen.</p> \n<p>Pessimism is the natural and persistent bedfellow of England supporters. The cameras homed in on Paul Farbrace, the interim coach, on the dressing-room balcony. In front of the Mound stand boundary, Moeen Ali, still in his training kit, batting gear carried snail-like on his back, scurried back from the nets to the pavilion, knowing that two wickets in two balls would have had him in trouble, as if trapped in one of those panic dreams that all cricketers have at some time.</p> \n<p>He need not have worried a jot. From the rubble, the innings was resurrected by the efficiency of Joe Root, and the uncomplicated exuberance of Ben Stokes, who through the rest of the morning and long into the afternoon added 161 for the fifth wicket before he was out, ironically being careful where he had been carefree, allowing a ball from the off-spinner Mark Craig to drift down the slope and bowl him.</p> \n<p>He received a standing ovation, and well deserved too, for the nature of a counterattack that had brought him 92 from only 94 balls, with 15 fours and a six pulled over midwicket as Matt Henry, the New Zealand debutant, thought to try to bounce him out.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2015/may/21/england-new-zealand-first-test-day-one-in-pictures\">England v New Zealand: first Test, day one – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For a while Root had kept pace with Stokes and more, until after the interval when so dominant did Stokes become, hitting with brutal power through midwicket in particular, that he took a pragmatic decision to just sit back and enjoy the ride from the other end. That Root himself did not go on to make a hundred, and a big one at that such is his appetite for runs now, was the only real surprise. But having got himself to within two runs of what would have been his seventh Test hundred, and third at Lord’s, he wafted outside off-stump, got the thinnest of inside edges and was caught behind.</p> \n<p>The ovation for him was no less generous though, and apart from the closest of close calls when an umpire’s decision on line alone saved him from lbw when 36, it was until his dismissal a chanceless exhibition of a batting skill honed since he was dropped for the Sydney Test in 2013 and hated it so much that he vowed never to experience it again. He hit 11 fours, including three in four balls off Craig to take him into lunch. Indisputably and evolutionary, in the past year he has taken over from Ian Bell as the batting linchpin of the team.</p> \n<p>The start was far from ideal for England, but the first morning of a Test at this time of year is always a tricky batting prospect. That McCullum put in England was no surprise, and perhaps over-intellectualising it to say he wanted to get at a captain under pressure and the other opener on debut. It was just the right decision on a surface that tends to get better as the match progresses.</p> \n<p>Three wickets before lunch might have been a decent trade-off in the circumstances, but four was one too many. Both teams had debutants, with Mark Wood as well as Lyth receiving England caps from Andrew Strauss, the former at the expense of Chris Jordan. Henry received his from McCullum.</p> \n<p>Lyth was off the mark perkily from his first ball, and was shaping well when he got the thinnest of edges to be caught behind, a good ball this from Tim Southee.</p> \n<p>Three wickets in 15 deliveries knocked things back further. Ballance was taken at third slip, Cook got something on a flurry of an attempted hook and Bell was beaten and bowled past the outside edge by a terrific ball from Henry.</p> \n<p>Until the last ball of the day, England were to prosper in the evening sunlight as Jos Buttler, with 67, and Moeen, 49 not out, added 103 for the seventh wicket either side of the second new ball at the old-fashioned rate of a run a minute.</p> \n<p>Finally they may have got things right with the order of three men each capable of batting at No6. Stokes, though, is a batsman who will bowl good fourth-seamer overs and as such would be wasted further down the order.</p> \n<p>And Buttler is the natural successor to Matt Prior, a player who needs time at the crease but who, in the right situation, will destroy opposition bowling. No7 is his natural habitat.</p> \n<p>For his part Moeen is just ubiquitous, but he looked totally comfortable at No8 and never once came close to getting run out.</p> \n<p>The final ball of the final over did for Buttler, who was lbw to Boult’s inswing. In cricket you take nothing for granted.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432231666941/Englands-Joe-Root--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Joe Root in action during the first day of the opening Test against New Zealand at Lord's.

He is definitely not signing. He’s not signing for &pound;700,000, &pound;800,000, &pound;900,000 a week. He is not signing. My job is to make sure I do the best with them [my clients]. If people say I am bad at my job, or they are badly advised it, does not matter.”</p> \n<p>Carragher had been critical of the way Sterling was taking on Liverpool, saying the 20-year-old should change his agent and accusing Ward of being responsible for a series of damaging and badly timed leaks aimed at ultimately getting a big-money transfer for his client.</p> \n<p>Ward’s response has been seen as further evidence at Anfield that the agent is determined to drive a wedge between the player and the club. “Carragher is a knob,” he allegedly said. “Everybody knows it. Any of the criticism from current pundits or ex-Liverpool players – none of those things matter to me. It is not relevant. I am not worried. Worried is making a decision not knowing what is going to happen. Every Premier League club will make a bid for him.”</p> \n<p>Ward, whose other clients include Saido Berahino and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, later tried to distance himself from those comments, claiming it was an off-the-record conversation and he had not been quoted fairly. However, the damage is substantial and Liverpool’s view is that there is no point having a meeting with someone who is not apparently even willing to listen to an offer. Liverpool have been made aware of interest from Manchester United, though there has been no official contact, and suspect it is genuine when Ward talks of all the major English clubs wanting Sterling.</p> \n<p>Rodgers is due to give his thoughts when he holds a news conference at 9.30am on Friday and is expected to reiterate Sterling is not for sale. However, it is also apparent the Sterling camp will do everything they can to make his position untenable. The player, who has two years remaining on his current deal, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/19/raheem-sterling-booed-liverpool-fans-club-awards-ceremony\" title=\"\">was jeered by some when he collected the club’s young player of the year award at a dinner on Tuesday</a> and this development will only worsen his standing among the club’s supporters.</p> \n<p>Hodgson has been monitoring the growing split and said he sympathised with Sterling, pointing out he is only 20 and inexperienced when it comes to handling these kind of issues. “I worry for all these young players, to be honest,” Hodgson said. “They become stars very quickly and we should never forget we’re dealing with very young people. They burst on the scene at a young age, and at 19 they are bona fide internationals with tens of caps and coming up to 100 league games, but we cannot given them the experience of a Wayne Rooney or Steven Gerrard. Unfortunately we can’t put another seven or eight years’ experience of life on his shoulders.”</p> \n<p>Hodgson said he would give Sterling career advice if the player asked, and added: “I hope that people don’t judge him too harshly, whatever he happens to do, because as a player and a character I find him spot-on. I trust him implicitly. I think he’s a very important player. And I really do sympathise with these players who have to live their lives under scrutiny – sometimes of their making, sometimes of other people’s making.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432234649344/england-roy-hodgson-rahee-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The England manager Roy Hodgson expressed concern for Raheem Sterling after Liverpool cancelled a scheduled meeting with the player.

The Portuguese former Barcelona and Real Madrid player said that the process was “anything but an election”.</p> \n<p>“This process is a plebiscite for the delivery of absolute power to one man – something I refuse to go along with,” he said. “That is why, after a personal reflection and sharing views with two other candidates in this process, I believe that what is going to happen on May 29 in Zurich is not a normal electoral act.”</p> \n<p>While he said some supported his desire for change, Figo said that at recent meetings of the continental confederations around the world he witnessed behaviour that “should shame anyone who desires soccer to be free, clean and democratic”. He added: “I have seen with my own eyes federation presidents who, after one day comparing Fifa leaders to the devil, then go on stage and compare those same people with Jesus Christ. Nobody told me about this. I saw it with my own eyes.”</p> \n<p>Figo was apparently referring to the Concacaf congress at which Blatter was improbably compared to Jesus, Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King. “The candidates were prevented from addressing federations at congresses while one of the candidates always gave speeches on his own from the rostrum. There has not been a single public debate about each candidate’s proposals,” he added.</p> \n<p>Blatter has refused to publish a manifesto or debate his scandal-hit presidency atop world football’s governing body, while only Uefa allowed the challengers to address delegates from the podium.</p> \n<p>The Uefa president, Michel Platini, welcomed the three challengers when they announced their candidacy, hoping they would be able to attack Blatter from different angles in a “multi-ball” strategy. But Blatter managed to choke off any debate and is widely expected to secure victory in the vote of 209 national associations next Friday. He is standing for a fifth term despite having earlier promised to stand down in 2015.</p> \n<p>Figo said: “For my part, I will abide by the ideas I leave written and have circulated, I am firm in my desire to take an active part in the regeneration of Fifa and I will be available for it whenever it is proven to me that we are not living under a dictatorship. I do not fear the ballot box, but I will not go along with nor will I give my consent to a process which will end on May 29 and from which soccer will not emerge the winner.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432231001915/Luis-Figo-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Luis Figo has withdrawn from the Fifa presidential race, eight days before an election where Sepp Blatter is expected to win a fifth term.

– was quickest in both practice runs here on Thursday.</p> \n<p>The afternoon session was shortened by rain but Hamilton still had time to show he was 0.74 seconds quicker than team-mate Nico Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel third in his Ferrari. Vettel’s team-mate Kimi Raikkonen was fourth, two-tenths of a second slower than Vettel.</p> \n<p>But it was a dismal session for race fans – less than 15 minutes in, Manor’s Roberto Merhi crashed into the barriers, causing the red flags to be waved. Six minutes later the action returned, but more rain forced the teams back into their garages and by the time it had relented, and the mopping up had taken place, there was time for only 10 minutes more action.</p> \n<p>Hamilton was also dominant in the morning run, this time finishing ahead of Max Verstappen and Daniel Ricciardo, followed by Vettel, Carlos Sainz and Pastor Maldonado. He was a second faster than Rosberg, who was back in ninth place. Hamilton was also 1.6 seconds faster than he was in the afternoon.</p> \n<p>There had been heavy overnight rain and even in the morning there was an atmosphere of chill dampness before FP1 got under way.</p> \n<p>Hamilton is looking for his first win here since his championship year of 2008, while Rosberg will be attempting to become the third driver to score a hat-trick of wins here, following Graham Hill and Ayrton Senna, who actually did five on the spin (1989-2003). Hamilton goes into Sunday’s Monaco Grahd Prix with a 20-point lead over Rosberg.</p> \n<p>Apart from the 30-year-old, the most eye-catching performance on Thursday arrived from Max Verstappen. The 17-year-old came second to the world champion in the morning and in the afternoon the Toro Ross driver was seventh. It was also an impressive day for Verstappen’s team-mate Carlos Sainz, who was fifth and sixth.</p> \n<p>On a number of occasions this season Toro Rosso have appeared faster than their senior partners, Red Bull. They outqualified them in Barcelona, though Red Bill proved the quicker team on race day.</p> \n<p>“It was a great performance by Max, by a man who is still too young to hire a car,” said Christian Horner, the Red Bull team principal.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Alex Wurz, the chairman of the grand prix drivers’ association (GPDA), appeared in the paddock on Thursday to announce that F1’s drivers wanted to hear the voice of race fans, with whom thy are conducting a survey. He said: “The survey is going on-line as we speak. We think it might become the biggest fan survey ever conducted in sport. It will continue for two weeks.</p> \n<p>“We want to communicate as drivers. We want to talk to our fans. We want to know what they think. And we want to be the interface between the drivers and the rule-makers. Modern communications allow us to do this. There is no sign we think the sport is in crisis. We just want to support the sport and future decisions. Though maybe there will be such a mixed message that there is no answer.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432219527961/Lewis-Hamilton-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lewis Hamilton signed a new £100m contract with Mercedes on Wednesday and was quickest in practice on Thursday in Monaco.
