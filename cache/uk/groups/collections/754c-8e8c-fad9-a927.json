Hardy souls still turned up first thing to sit swaddled optimistically in the stands but with never a hope of play until, around midday, the skies brightened, then cleared and the mopping up began.</p> \n<p>By half past one, the sun now out, play was delayed not so much by the condition of the outfield away from the acreage of covers across the square itself as by the need to set up and calibrate the technology on which so much depends these days.</p> \n<p>If play was necessarily shortened by 25 overs, to be made up over the remainder of the match, then it can scarcely be said that the entertainment was lessened proportionately.</p> \n<p>There were wickets for Jimmy Anderson, two of them with the new ball, the first of which made him the eighth paceman, and the first England bowler, to reach 400 Test wickets.</p> \n<p>There was a battling half-century from Tom Latham, who flayed anything off line, drove nicely, missed a few and, while riding his luck both with catching (he was missed twice, at first slip by Alastair Cook, who may have hurt his hand in the process, and at square leg) and with the umpire, generally held things steady until he drove once too often and edged to first slip for 84.</p> \n<p>And of course there was another counter-punching cameo from Brendon McCullum, who followed his first ball duck at Lord’s by driving the first ball of his innings here thrillingly on the rise over extra cover for six and threw the bat as he might for Chennai Super Kings until he holed out to mid-off to the first ball after the tea interval.</p> \n<p>McCullum had set the tone on a New Zealand innings that rattled along at five runs per over, a rate that even then picked up with the advent of Luke Ronchi, making his Test match debut as wicketkeeper, while the injured BJ Watling retained his place as a batsman only.</p> \n<p>Ronchi is a limited-overs cricketer of some prowess, a striker of the ball in the McCullum mode, and Test matches clearly hold no terrors for him as he hammered his way merrily to a 37-ball half-century, a landmark reached with his second six.</p> \n<p>Test cricket was once a game where as a spectator it was possible to dip in and out, go to the bar, picnic in the Coronation Garden at Lord’s and still pick up the pattern of play.</p> \n<p>But not with this New Zealand team, for it would be a foolish person who takes his eyes off for a second. This was the fastest Test half-century seen on this ground and the second-fastest ever by a debutant anywhere (Tim Southee, curiously, the fastest, also against England, in Napier).</p> \n<p>Nor did Ronchi stop there. Moeen Ali’s offspin was treated roughly, twice carted over midwicket for six and once over long-on; he was willing in going for the hook when Stuart Broad, trading blows, went on one of his short-pitched rampages; and he was finally caught by one of the three men posted out on the legside for 88, from 70 balls, with 13 fours and three sixes.</p> \n<p>The Black Caps may have been defeated at Lord’s but they gained friends and they have lost none here.</p> \n<p>By the day’s end New Zealand, at 297 for eight, had more than just shaded it, especially so given their start. If the cloud rolls in for the second day, or even if not, England may have their hands full.</p> \n<p>It was probably a good toss for Cook to win. If the weather had perked up, and there was a stiffish breeze biffing across the ground, then the pitch had been under cover all night and throughout the morning and was given its final wash-and-brush-up only shortly before the toss.</p> \n<p>There ought to have been some juice there for the England seamers, set up perhaps for Anderson, who responded thrillingly, having Martin Guptill well caught by Ian Bell above his head at second slip for a second consecutive duck and then, two balls later, finding the edge of Kane Williamson’s bat just as a heavy shower arrived. New Zealand were two for two and the third over of the day not yet done.</p> \n<p>The boundaries began to flow, though, as Anderson and Broad started to pitch shorter than they might, not significantly but sufficient for the square areas to be yielding runs.</p> \n<p>Latham and Ross Taylor raced along, until the latter chose not to play a shot at Broad and, with the ball keeping uncommonly low, was lbw.</p> \n<p>McCullum did not allow England to seize the momentum and carry it on. His first delivery from Broad was perfectly respectable, on a decent length with perhaps just a little too much width so that McCullum, staying inside the line, played it perfectly, and with precision, over the extra-cover boundary, an extraordinary shot by any standard but remarkable for the first ball of an innings.</p> \n<p>McCullum had made 41 from 28 balls and was promising something quite spectacular when his innings ended tamely, as he toe-poked the first ball after tea to mid off, turned and marched off smartly.</p> \n<p>But he had set an example. England became ragged, the field spread and the gaps were found. Mark Wood disposed of Watling readily enough with a beautiful bail-trimmer but Latham and Ronchi added 120 for the sixth wicket, from only 146 balls, to take the day away from England.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/29/1432925763516/Luke-Ronchi-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Stuart Broad looks on as New Zealand batsman Luke Ronchi, on his Test debut, hits out on the first day of the Headingley Test.

The leader of Alastair Cook’s attack admits he will soon be considered over the hill but that day is being delayed by the rejuvenating effects of playing alongside an aggressive group of young cricketers.</p> \n<p>Anderson reduced New Zealand to two for two at Headingley with the removal of Martin Guptill and Kane Williamson, the first of which chalked up the latest milestone in the right-armer’s career. Now sitting four short of the 405 Test victims of West Indies’ great Curtly Ambrose – albeit 162 wickets behind the top-ranked seamer, Glenn McGrath, in fourth place – the Lancashire bowler is proud to be in such exalted company.</p> \n<p>“It’s a nice feeling and it was a proud moment for me,” Anderson said. “It feels a bit surreal when you see the list of guys who have done it, guys I’ve watched and admired over the years. I knew it was there so it was nice to get it out the way early so I could try to concentrate on bowling. I’d rather do it at Old Trafford but it will do.”</p> \n<p>Those early strikes did not stop the scoreboard ticking over like a fruit machine, with the tourists continuing their all-out attack approach from Lord’s and reaching 297 for eight. There has been a perceived change in England’s approach this summer too, with Anderson admitting the all-rounder Ben Stokes and the fast bowler Mark Wood have made the switch to Test cricket natural, not forced.</p> \n<p>“The teams are both playing aggressive cricket,” Anderson said. “We kept trying to take wickets and kept attacking fields, so when we didn’t bowl well they punished us. The players we’ve got, like Mark Wood and Ben Stokes, are naturally attacking cricketers who want to take wickets – guys like that are moving us into playing that sort of cricket and fighting fire with fire.</p> \n<p>“It’s been a good period for me and Stuart Broad; we’ve always relied on bowling economically but seeing these guys come in is quite a fresh feel to the side. It is rubbing off on us and it’s good for someone like me, who is almost over the hill. These guys give you a kick up the backside. You can’t help but admire the way they play.”</p> \n<p>Another such free spirit is the New Zealand wicketkeeper Luke Ronchi who, on making his Test debut aged 34, was simply trying to enjoy the moment. Some 88 runs flew from his bat in just 70 balls in a crucial sixth-wicket partnership of 120 with Tom Latham and, while he claims his nerves were under control, the sight of the batsman before him – his captain, Brendon McCullum – carving his first ball for six did heighten the senses slightly.</p> \n<p>“I may never play another Test so I would hate to go out there, feel nervous and not play my natural game,” said Ronchi, who came in for the injured all-rounder Corey Anderson and who is the first Luke to play Test cricket. “I was trying to enjoy the ride. You get a bit twitchy when Baz [McCullum] does that but that is how he is doing it right now. He plays some amazing shots and then he plays some other sort of shots. But he’s telling us to play freely and I don’t see that changing any time soon.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/29/1432931120865/Jimmy-Anderson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jimmy Anderson, here against India in 2014, became the first England bowler to reach 400 Test wickets when he struck early against New Zealand.

H&eacute;ctor Beller&iacute;n boards the bus bound for Wembley on Saturday, it will be impossible for him not to reflect on the journey he made a year before. When <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/may/17/fa-cup-final-arsenal-hull-city-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal played Hull in last season’s FA Cup final</a> the Spaniard got together with the club’s other young players, sporting their boyband civvies, pretty relaxed, and made his way there to sit in the crowd and watch. At the time Beller&iacute;n had made just one appearance for Arsenal – roughly 25 minutes as a substitute in extra time of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/sep/25/west-bromwich-albion-arsenal-capital-one-cup\" title=\"\">a Capital One Cup tie at West Brom</a>. Watching the first team parading around the silver, he felt a surge of desire to have that feeling himself some day. “It was an inspiration,” he says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/29/wojciech-szczesny-arsenal-father-idiotic-comments\">Arsenal’s Wojciech Szczesny hits back at father’s ‘idiotic comments’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In one season he has been transformed from talented, eager-to-learn youngster who was probably looking at another loan into Arsenal’s first-choice right-back for this season’s Wembley showpiece. He never saw it coming so quickly. “If they had told me at the beginning of the season it would turn out like this I wouldn’t have believed it,” he says in the expert Catalan/cockney twang he has developed since moving to London four years ago.</p> \n<p>Last summer, Arsenal spent more than &pound;20m on players earmarked to slot in at right-back after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jun/13/bacary-sagna-manchester-city-arsenal-three-year-deal\" title=\"\">the departure of Bacary Sagna</a>. But the way Beller&iacute;n has so vibrantly seized his moment – comfortable on the ball, speedy enough to zoom into recovery tackles and keen to maraud forwards as a couple of goals to his name testifies – means Mathieu Debuchy and Calum Chambers have their work cut out to elbow him out the team.</p> \n<p>Beller&iacute;n carries the air of a character who loves to throw himself into any situation with a ready supply of enthusiasm and confidence. It was this aspect of his character that drew him towards Arsenal in the first place. Barcelona-born and educated at La Masia, he turned down his boyhood club’s contract offers at the age of 16, tempted by the same kind of overtures and opportunities as those that brought about Cesc F&agrave;bregas’s development.</p> \n<p>During the same summer that Beller&iacute;n and his friend Jon Toral arrived at Arsenal from the Camp Nou, F&agrave;bregas made the return journey. Their paths crossed briefly. “He introduced me to the club, he welcomed me and Jon,” recalls Beller&iacute;n. “He just told me that everything we need at the club would be here for us.</p> \n<p>“If I stayed there, I don’t know what I would have been. Some of my team-mates play second division, and they will probably get relegated. So being here, and playing Premier League and Champions League, I’m really happy I made that step. The success of Cesc F&agrave;bregas, that he grew up here more than in Barcelona, was something that attracted me a lot.</p> \n<p>“I’m the kind of person who likes new challenges and for me it was a new challenge. Some people prefer to stay home in their comfort zone. I felt the right thing to do was to come here. It was difficult at the beginning but I am really glad I made that decision. Here the work is paying off; the risk of coming to something new is paying off.”</p> \n<p>A family man, his parents and sister have moved to London to be with him. His right arm is embellished with a detailed tattoo designed by his sister, with references to all his family members. Although F&agrave;bregas famously hankered for a return to Barcelona after several years at Arsenal, Beller&iacute;n doesn’t for the moment have those instincts.</p> \n<p>“If I wanted to be at Barcelona I would have stayed there,” he says. “My challenge was to come to England and I came here with everything.”</p> \n<p>In his youth Beller&iacute;n admired the Barcelona players of the age. Who wouldn’t? “I was growing up as a winger, so obviously when Ronaldinho was over there and Messi started playing they were probably my role models, and Rivaldo, players who played up front. You can take loads of things from Xavi and Iniesta. And Puyol – his leadership was something I looked up to when I was a kid.”</p> \n<p>He arrived at Arsenal willing to watch and learn all over again. He was not afraid to move position, aware that Ars&egrave;ne Wenger had full-back in mind for him. Adapting quickly comes with the territory in his career so far.</p> \n<p>Last term he enjoyed a developmental spell on loan with Watford, who train just over the other side of the hedges that flank Arsenal’s London Colney pitches. “It was a bit weird to see my team-mates driving by,” he smiles. “It was a great experience for me, having Gianfranco Zola as a coach. He is a legend and taught me a lot. It helped me as a player and as a person as well.”</p> \n<p>Beller&iacute;n’s performances in pre-season – when he broke the club’s speed record with a 4.41-second sprint over 40 metres, breaking a mark set by Theo Walcott – struck his manager, and Wenger opted against another loan move for the player.</p> \n<p>Beller&iacute;n felt the same sense of amazement he now feels about Wembley when he made <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/sep/16/borussia-dortmund-arsenal-champions-league\" title=\"\">his full debut last September at Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League</a>. The season before he was in the crowd for the same fixture. It was a meaningful but also very challenging night.</p> \n<p>“That is probably one of the hardest stages in Europe and in the world,” he says. “So to have played those games so early for me, even though the performances probably weren’t as good, was a really good lesson for me as a young player.</p> \n<p>“It just made me want to prove to people those were just accidents. You need to learn and be in those situations. And then after, when games go more in your favour, you can show people what you can do.</p> \n<p>“That was something crazy, to see in one year I was going from the stands to the pitch. Hopefully this year Wembley can be the same. It will be such an achievement for me.”</p> \n<p>Had events turned in a different way, had Debuchy not suffered freak injuries, Beller&iacute;n might have been off to the FA Cup final as a spectator again. He couldn’t feel more ready for centre stage.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432914176613/H-ctor-Beller-n-Arsenal-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Héctor Bellerín, left, hopes to cap a fine season a full-back for Arsenal with his first appearance in an FA Cup final.

Even more so as Saturdays’s FA Cup final marks the biggest managerial occasion in the career of Aston Villa’s own magnetic force of nature, Tim Sherwood.</p> \n<p>It has been a little too easy for some to dismiss Sherwood as a modern-day reboot of the old shouty English manager, Alan Latchley in a goose-down gilet. What success he has had, the theory goes, is based not in sound, transformational methods, but in the ability to induce a kind of instant motivational rage. Sherwood, at Tottenham and now Villa, has acted as a managerial amphetamine, an easy buzz, a Red Bull appointment.</p> \n<p>Hopefully this is about to change. Not least because for all his raggedness and bluster it is clear Sherwood has some very obvious strengths. This is a manager who in 43 Premier League matches at two clubs over two seasons has had a significant galvanising effect on an unusual number of players, not to mention leaving Spurs and Villa higher in the table than he found them. At Wembley, Sherwood could become the second English manger to win the FA Cup since Joe Royle in 1995. Not to mention – and get this – the only currently employed English manager with a major trophy to his name.</p> \n<p>No doubt Sherwood’s brashness hasn’t helped, the king-geezer schtick on the touchline, where he looks less like a cutting-edge modern manager and more like a man about to have a fight at a wedding. There is undoubtedly a skein of snobbishness in this, a reaction to the basic tone and style of Sherwood’s short-term success at Villa, which has, nonetheless, been sensational.</p> \n<p>Before he was appointed Villa had scored 12 goals in 25 Premier League matches under Paul Lambert, who, towards the end, seemed to watch his own team in a state of detached amusement, to the extent you half expected to look up and notice him doing some other more useful task like putting together a flatpack sideboard, or sorting a basket of laundry, with just half an eye vaguely on the football. In three months since, Sherwood has brought eight reviving wins and a slightly wild sense of full-throttle freedom. His players have stormed forward at every opportunity with wild, drunken abandon, while Sherwood has been re-cast as a kind of Man at C&amp;A Zdenek Zeman. His methods might look simple enough: pick your most skilful players; pass the ball quickly; run hard in attack; and do whatever it takes to get your best goalscorer firing. But they work. Fabian Delph has been transformed into a spiky little swaggering midfield prince. Tom Cleverley, who played with a faux Xavi-lite gravitas at Manchester United, like an overly grave and serious teenager, has discovered his own inner Tim-drive. Jack Grealish, who under Lambert was hidden away like a delicate consumptive child, has become a regular cog, funnelling possession, discomfiting defences, and transmitting a heads-up, ball-playing confidence.</p> \n<p>There is plenty of method here. A midfield diamond has added a supporting weight of numbers around Christian Benteke to great effect, and encouraged Villa’s high-energy ball-carriers to attack from disconcerting angles. Above all, Sherwood wants his team to run, to sprint, to move with freedom and creative aggression, in its own way an Anglo-variation on the heavy-metal football of J&uuml;rgen Klopp, or the more refined, carefully calibrated obsession with sprints of Joachim L&ouml;w’s Germany.</p> \n<p>Really, though, the best thing about Sherwood is his aggression, his fury, his alluringly pantomime-ish presence. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/25/premier-league-2014-15-writers-best-and-worst\" title=\"\">As my colleague Scott Murray put it this week</a>, Sherwood appears to appreciate that football is a piece of theatre. He prowls and prances. He radiates a brooding, peaty masculinity.</p> \n<p>At the end of which it is hard for the English-leaning neutral not to want Villa and their own impossibly watchable Tim to win the FA Cup. In Ars&egrave;ne Wenger, Sherwood’s opposite number and English football’s arch euro modernist, there is at least an illuminating contrast. For Arsenal, winning the FA Cup represents a slightly better alternative than not winning the FA Cup, a least good trophy-winning option. Whereas for Villa and Sherwood victory would be a moment to revive not just a club but even the Cup itself. Just imagine, for a moment, the celebrations. Sherwood isn’t just going to put the lid on his head, he’s going to eat it. He’s going to climb the arch in his underpants, a corner flag in each ear, pausing only to challenge Pep Guardiola, Alex Ferguson, Herbert Chapman and Mario Zagallo to a mixed martial arts death match.</p> \n<p>Or perhaps not. Either way Sherwood does deserve a little respect. Not just for his underrated sense of method but because he is, above all, an antidote to the one thing football really has to fear: predictability, set formulae, a dwindling away of its own irrational, vaulting, agreeably toxic passions. Sherwood may have failed to shake, just yet, the feeling this a manager who’s here for a good time not a long time but one thing is for sure – it certainly won’t be boring.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article was corrected on 29 May 2015 to reflect the fact that Tim Sherwood could become the second English manger to win the FA Cup since Joe Royle in 1995.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432910627783/1dc84d12-026f-4a07-a281-6453d7335f17-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Tim Sherwood illustration.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-29T15:12:00Z","lastModified":"2015-05-29T15:12:33Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Barney Ronay","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733733869/BarneyRonay.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/barneyronay"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Tim Sherwood","Aston Villa","FA Cup","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/tim-sherwood","webTitle":"Tim Sherwood"},{"id":"football/aston-villa","webTitle":"Aston Villa"},{"id":"football/fa-cup","webTitle":"FA Cup"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Barney Ronay","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/barneyronay"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/29/tim-sherwood-peter-cook-fa-cup-arsenal","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49b3g","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/blog/2015/may/29/tim-sherwood-peter-cook-fa-cup-arsenal","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/may/29/tim-sherwood-peter-cook-fa-cup-arsenal"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432910627783/1dc84d12-026f-4a07-a281-6453d7335f17-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘No doubt Sherwood’s brashness hasn’t helped, the king-geezer schtick on the touchline, where he looks less like a cutting-edge modern manager and more like a man about to have a fight at a wedding.’ Photograph: Illustration: David Lyttleton/Guardian","credit":"Illustration: David Lyttleton/Guardian","altText":"Tim Sherwood illustration.","cleanCaption":"‘No doubt Sherwood’s brashness hasn’t helped, the king-geezer schtick on the touchline, where he looks less like a cutting-edge modern manager and more like a man about to have a fight at a wedding.’","cleanCredit":"Illustration: David Lyttleton/Guardian"}},"importance":0,"kicker":{"title":"Barney Ronay"},"byline":{"title":"Barney Ronay"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[]}]},{"title":"Premiership final / Bath reinvent golden era with a modern twist","rawTitle":"Bath reinvent golden era with a modern twist","item":{"type":"article","id":"sport/2015/may/29/bath-reinvent-golden-era-premiership-final-saracens","title":"Bath reinvent golden era with a modern twist as Premiership final awaits","trailText":"Captain Stuart Hooper and his squad decided ‘to reconnect with what the club are all about’ and now Saracens stand between them and a first league title since 1996","standFirst":"<p>Stuart Hooper and his squad decided ‘to reconnect with what the club are all about’ – now Saracens stand between them and a first league title since 1996</p>","byline":"Robert Kitson","body":"<p>One of the central planks of Bath’s renaissance often goes unnoticed. Even <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/28/salary-cap-bath-saracens-premiership-final\" title=\"\">in a Twickenham final week</a>, amid the splendour of the club’s manor house HQ in Farleigh Hungerford, surprisingly few choose to seek him out. “Anyone want to speak to Stuart Hooper?” asks a plucky press officer, sticking her head around the door of the music room: this is Bath, remember. Her audience, their notebooks already full of quotes from Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph, fall guiltily silent. Their editors will always find space for a “Slammin” Sam Burgess story but good old Stuart not so much.</p> \n<p>Too many are missing the bigger picture. Hooper was working towards such days long before Burgess arrived. As the club’s captain since 2011, Hooper has seen such respected coaches as Sir Ian McGeechan and Gary Gold come and go. Even Bruce Craig, whose millions have funded the grandest of rugby designs, and Mike Ford, the head coach, are marginally less qualified to pinpoint why the team are back tilting for a Premiership title.</p> \n<p>It was Hooper – described by Ford as “the best captain I have ever worked with” – who spoke powerfully in favour of a change of culture two years ago when the wisdom of Craig’s investment was looking rather shakier. “We decided to have this reconnection with what Bath are all about. Not what we think we’re about but actually looking back at history, at the pillars of our existence.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/28/salary-cap-bath-saracens-premiership-final\">Salary cap may not fit Bath or Saracens but critics have to wear it – for now</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In Bath’s case that meant talking to old coaches and players – among them Jack Rowell, David Trick and Lee Mears – as well as supporters to identify what made the club special.</p> \n<p>Aside from great players, two recurring themes emerged: an attacking style of rugby and a player-led environment. Hooper concedes the club had drifted away from what people loved most. “The identity of the club had not been paid a huge amount of attention. Ian McGeechan has been a hugely successful coach with the Lions and he brought the Geech way, as you would. Gary had been successful with the Springboks but all the time I knew what Bath was all about. I’d seen it as a kid. I guess the reality is that for a couple of years we went away from that and weren’t true to the identity of the club.”</p> \n<p>Reinventing golden-era Bath with a modern twist has meant delegating more influence to the players, with Hooper and his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/22/bath-team-ford-premiership-play-off-semi-final-leicester-mike-george\" title=\"\">fly-half George Ford</a> the primary go-betweens. “Jack Rowell was way ahead of his time,” nods the 33-year-old Hooper. “Our coaches do as much, if not more, than any in the Premiership but they don’t come to a meeting and fire it all at us. If you read any coaching manual it says players are the ones who make decisions on the field. We took a conscious decision to live that. Someone like Jos&eacute; Mourinho is a fantastic motivator but in rugby it’s not quite like that. There needs to be something deeper, a higher purpose.”</p> \n<p>That “higher purpose” is now fuelling the kind of positive, instinctive rugby that Stuart Barnes, Jeremy Guscott and Simon Halliday used to specialise in. Hooper, as any self-respecting lock should, emphasises it is not only about a few whizzy backs. “People assume the word attack means running from everywhere but, in reality, it means asserting yourself on the opposition. We let it flow through everything we do. When we first came to Farleigh a small group of us were ushered into the music room. Bruce introduced himself as the new owner of Bath and said: ‘This is your new home.’ Bruce is a tremendously successful businessman but he doesn’t stand still – and that’s rubbed off on us. Every day we come to training we want to be the best we can be. You can’t just expect it to happen.”</p> \n<p>Loyal Bath supporters may be interested to hear Stuart Lancaster has also played a significant part in their side’s resurgence. Hooper and England’s current head coach worked together at Leeds a decade ago and have a shared interest in team-building that still endures. The culture Hooper has fostered at Bath – such as insisting on a team dinner before big games in the main hall at Farleigh House – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/26/bath-saracens-premiership-final-england-world-cup-glasgow-munster\" title=\"\">largely mirrors Lancaster’s approach with the national squad</a>. “Even now we speak all the time,” reveals Hooper. “It must be quite good for him because he can get a player’s perspective of the club game. He’s massively interested in what players are like off the field.</p> \n<p>Hooper also owes a debt to Saturday’s opponents Saracens, where he began his professional career. During the era of Francois Pienaar and Wayne Shelford he captained the club in Europe – the dressing room included such players as Paul Wallace, Abdel Benazzi, Christian Califano and Thomas Castaign&egrave;de – while still a teenager. Mixing with gal&aacute;cticos gave him an insight, among other things, into how to handle players when a high-profile figure such as Burgess is parachuted in over their heads. “It’s fine to ask: ‘What can I do to get back in the team?’ But if they’re moaning and grumbling, that’s when I’d have to step in.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/26/bath-saracens-premiership-final-england-world-cup-glasgow-munster\">Bath and Saracens final may offer a few clues for England at the World Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The ego-free Hooper has always had a strong work ethic, having watched his father – who spent the last 10 of his 35 years in the police force operating for special branch in Exeter – and mother, a classroom assistant, painstakingly build the family home in Cheriton Fitzpaine near Crediton. “Dad basically built our whole house in the evenings after work. At weekends they’d both work on the house. It was a labour of love but I took a lot from it. Keep your head down, keep working and good times will come.”</p> \n<p>All of which explains why Bath think they have the best skipper around. Peter Stringer, who spent years listening to Paul O’Connell in Munster and Ireland dressing rooms, rates the clarity of Hooper’s team talks particularly highly. “He is a guy you would want in your team every day of the week because of his knowledge of the game and his ability to get the best out of guys. He really is one of the best I’ve come across.”</p> \n<p>Will it all be enough, however, to earn Bath’s first league title – staggeringly – since 1996? Saracens have won nine of their past 10 Premiership games against Bath and Jacques Burger and Brad Barritt are expert human barricades. Hooper, whose wife is expecting their fourth child in July, will also cite the 2005 Powergen Cup final, when he played against Bath for Leeds.</p> \n<p>“As we drove to Twickenham and looked out of the window everything was blue, black and white. It was Bath’s 13th cup final at Twickenham and they’d never lost.” Against all the odds <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2005/apr/18/rugbyunion.bath\" title=\"\">Leeds won 20-12</a>.

With no sign of Ulster in this Guinness Pro 12 final it remains to be seen exactly how many turn up at Kingspan Stadium, but if the last month is an accurate form guide then it will be worth the effort.</p> \n<p>For Munster, looking for their fourth title, there is the supplementary issue of seeing off Paul O’Connell in style before he takes up residency in France, most likely Toulon. For Glasgow, who are seeing off a handful of players themselves, the agenda is more clear-cut: winning will validate the progress of the last three seasons, in which they have reached back-to-back semi-finals before last season losing their first decider – to Leinster.</p> \n<p>Getting across that line has presented Gregor Townsend with a few painful decisions. Like telling the fit-again captain Al Kellock, who like O’Connell will be playing his last game for the club, that he will start on the bench rather than in the second row, despite having recovered from the concussion suffered in the semi-final win over Ulster. Or swapping Adam Ashe with Rob Harley, and Ryan Wilson for Chris Fusaro. All of which suggests they needed to sort things out up front to withstand the Munster challenge.</p> \n<p>“We know we have to get certain fundamentals right to win games no matter who we’re playing against,” Townsend said. “It starts with being strong in defence, and we prepare on what we expect from Munster in terms of their patterns of play and what they might do at set pieces. But if you’ve got someone you’ve got to tackle ahead of you you’ve got to knock him down, so we know we have to do that to stop them getting any momentum.</p> \n<p>“On the other side, obviously, when we have the ball we know we’ve got to be accurate. We’ll have to work hard to create opportunities, but if we do – in finals, you’ve got to take them.”</p> \n<p>The sequence of Glasgow’s league finishes over the last four campaigns – fourth to first in that order – suggests good things and they will be further encouraged by the removal from the Munster equation of Conor Murray and captain Peter O’Mahony. Along with O’Connell and Ian Keatley they make up the cornerstones of the Munster team. In which case O’Connell will be carrying more of the load than he might have planned.</p> \n<p>“Look, I think it goes back to the fact that it’s an occasion,” Anthony Foley said. “There’s a lot of players that won’t play for Munster again. There’s a few there who will be togging out, there’s a few who won’t, but Paul has done above and beyond for the province, for Young Munster and for Ireland.</p> \n<p>“It wasn’t spoken about last week – it hasn’t been mentioned this week. I think everyone’s intelligent enough to understand the situation, to go about doing their job. If we all do our jobs to the best of our ability, we’ll get the outcome we deserve. If we start thinking about different things and getting distracted by it, getting emotional … then that’s a negative. We want to stay on top of it and be positive around it and go and give it our best performance and see where that takes us.”</p> \n<p>The swing on the injury front suggests it may take the title to Glasgow for the first time. Having been rattled up front by Ulster, the reaction from Townsend should pay dividends. Munster, meanwhile, will be hoping the locals change the habits of a lifetime and give them a dig out.</p> \n<p><strong>Glasgow Warriors</strong> Hogg; Seymour, Vernon, Horne, Van der Merwe; Russell, Pyrgos; Reid, Hall, De Klerk, Nakarawa, Gray, Harley, Wilson, Strauss (captain).</p> \n<p><strong>Replacements</strong> Brown, Yanuyanutawa, Welsh, Kellock, Fusaro, Matawalu, Weir, Lamont.</p> \n<p><strong>Munster</strong> Jones; Earls, Smith, Hurley (captain), Zebo; Keatley, Williams; Kilcoyne, Guinazu, Botha, Holland, O’Connell, Ryan, Butler, Stander.</p> \n<p><strong>Replacements</strong> Casey, Cronin, Archer, Dougall, O’Donoghue, Sheridan, Hanrahan, O’Mahony.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/29/1432918342129/Paul-OConnell-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Paul O'Connell is ready to go one last time for Munster before his probable move to Toulon.

As she says, she is entering unknown territory. However, as she makes the final preparations for her first heptathlon since London 2012, she is on familiar ground.</p> \n<p>It was in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/may/27/jessica-ennis-olympics-2012-athletics\" title=\"\">G&ouml;tzis in 2012 that Ennis-Hill broke Denise Lewis’s British record by scoring 6,906 points</a>, and showed she was ready to face the physical and psychological pressures of a home Games. This weekend, however, the sights are set far lower. Her first target is to score the 6,200 points required to make the qualifying standard for the Rio Olympics. The next is to convince herself that aiming for a medal at the World Championships in Beijing in August has any basis in reality.</p> \n<p>“If I’m going to the World Championships I want to be competitive and I want to medal,” she said. “Just seeing how I put a heptathlon together will give me an idea of whether I can go away, put in some more training and come back stronger, or whether I’m struggling.”</p> \n<p>Ennis-Hill has the same uncompromising approach when it comes to next year’s Olympics. “When I think about Rio I don’t want to go to be fourth or fifth,” she said. “I want a medal. It’s such a big ask to win back-to-back Olympic golds. It would be hard to top London but back-to-back golds would.”</p> \n<p>There have been limited, but encouraging, signs that she is heading in the right direction. Three weeks ago <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/09/jessica-ennis-hill-returns-to-the-track\" title=\"\">she ran 13.14sec for the 100m hurdles in the Manchester City Games</a>, more than half a second down on her personal best, but still better than almost every other heptathlete she will face in G&ouml;tzis. Then, a fortnight ago, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/16/jessica-ennis-hill-continues-comeback-loughborough\" title=\"\">she jumped 6.16m in the long jump and threw 43.88m in the javelin at a meeting in Loughborough</a> – again, far from her best, but enough to hint of better things to come.</p> \n<p>However, there are still many unanswerables. Ennis-Hill has not done the high jump, shot put or run 800m since 2012. It remains to be seen how her body, which returned to training after the birth of her son, Reggie, in November, will react to two days of intense competition. The possibility of rain on Saturday could also put a dampener on her ambitions.</p> \n<p>Ennis-Hill insists that her training is “not a million miles” away from where it was in London 2012, although she did have to back off this year because of an achilles injury. That seems to have settled down and a physiotherapist and massage therapist are on hand to make sure it behaves itself this weekend.</p> \n<p>“I’m a slightly older athlete now and I’m not going to be able to train in the way I did what I was 25,” she said. “I can’t just absolutely hammer my body all the time because it probably will break down. I’m going to have to train a bit more sensibly.”</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, Ennis-Hill’s long-anticipated clash with Katarina Johnson-Thompson has been postponed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/12/katarina-johnson-thompson-gotzis-heptathlon\" title=\"\">as the latter is recovering from a knee injury</a>. But the prestigious Hypo meeting contains its usual stellar field, including the 2013 world championship silver medallist, Brianne Theisen-Eaton, and two athletes from the low countries – Dafne Schippers and Nafissatou Thiam – with high ambitions.</p> \n<p>Morgan Lake, Britain’s 18-year-old wunderkind, is also here despite being in the middle of her A-levels. “It’s been hard doing training and studying,” Lake said, “but my aim is to get a personal best and the Olympic standard. This year I’ve stepped up a level.”</p> \n<p>Ennis-Hill, meanwhile, said that having Reggie sleeping through the night has made a big difference to her training because she is not so tired – and her son surprised her further recently by starting to walk. “When he was about nine months he took some wobbly steps but we had to trick him to do it, but the other week he took some little steps to me and he kept on going.”</p> \n<p>Ennis-Hill believes she is ready to take her own wobbly step back into elite level. “I definitely think I can still be competitive,” she said. “I am looking forward to it and I still feel I’ve got it within me.” We will have a much better idea if she is right on Sunday evening.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/5/29/1432914905688/Jessica-Ennis-Hill-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jessica Ennis-Hill aims to score 6,200 points in Götzis and make the heptathlon qualifying standard for the Rio Olympics.

He underwent chemotherapy, eventually pulling on the black and white shirt again for the first time against Manchester United on 4 March.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t know how my body was going to react,” he told the Shields Gazette this week. “Every day, I was improving.

He is next due to appear at the US Open in mid-June.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/22/rory-mcilroy-wentworth-luke-donald-pga-championship\">Rory McIlroy misses cut at Wentworth but Luke Donald hits the roof</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>To his credit, McIlroy made a valiant effort towards weekend survival. He had reached two under par for the day when taking to the 15th tee; a double bogey on that hole killed home hope. Maybe next year will provide solace for McIlroy. If rumour is to be heeded, Tiger Woods will appear at this event, thereby taking a large chunk of attention elsewhere.</p> \n<p>This time, Padraig Harrington could still bring that smile to Irish eyes once more. The 43-year-old is having a curious season, during which he has vaulted back to prominence with a terrific success at the Honda Classic but possibly suffered through an abundance of playing commitments thereafter.</p> \n<p>Harrington retains a live chance of success despite disappointment at a second round of 73, leaving him two under par on aggregate. Handily, he has seen and done this all before. “The pressure wouldn’t be gone but it certainly is less or I’m certainly trying to make myself believe that at least. Yes, having won one is always nice,” he said. It would be something to miss in my CV if I had not won an Irish Open. And the pressure to win any tournament is enough to keep your mind occupied.”</p> \n<p>Harrington sat at seven under with eight holes to play before a sloppy closing stretch that included back-to-back bogeys in his last two. Perhaps this summed up his year. “I was very comfortable through 28 holes,” he said. “I had a putt there to go eight under par and everything was easy at that stage. What I went through over the last six or seven holes is what most of the players are going through all the time. Hopefully I won’t do it again over the weekend. Hopefully I’ve had my bad run.</p> \n<p>“I am pleased to be in contention. Clearly I would have preferred to be that seven, eight under par type thing where I would be in a good position to move away from the field. I’m now in a position that I’m going to have to play well and not get anything going against me.</p> \n<p>“There will be a lot of people just making the cut that will feel like they have a chance of winning now that I’ve come back to the pack in some way. It’s going to be a much tougher weekend. I won’t have the luxury of having any bad runs.”</p> \n<p>On the wider issue of playing in front of a captive audience, Harrington said it can be tricky to play in front of a crowd that is “willing you on so much”. He added: “I do say there is more distraction at an Irish Open; the times you hit a shot and you’ve let people down is not a normal emotion.</p> \n<p>“During The Irish Open, you do sometimes hit a bad shot and you want to tell everybody: ‘It was actually really difficult.’”</p> \n<p>The 2009 champion, Shane Lowry, had a tricky time. He broke his putter on the third, his 12th hole, and putted with a wedge for the remainder of the round, which he covered in two over par to be four over for the tournament. “I’m not proud of myself and I apologised to the lads [his playing partners Francesco Molinari and Ernie Els] at the end,” he said.</p> \n<p>At three under, Scotland’s Richie Ramsay is a threat to Harrington although this remains a wide open tournament. Ramsay predicted the winning score “won’t get to double digits under par”.</p> \n<p>McIlroy will not be part of that discussion but his impact has been a positive one.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/29/1432929127388/Rory-McIlroy-Irish-Open-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy missed the cut for the Irish Open after his Friday round of 71 left him at nine over par.

The greatest people in every sport have an unbelievable amount of self-confidence. I think that’s one thing that makes me a good tennis player: I have a lot of belief in myself. You don’t see many 19-year-olds or 20-year-olds beating the greatest of all time.”</p> \n<p>As for his hopes in Paris, he added: “I’ve got pretty high expectations for myself. I’ve had some really good results the last couple of weeks. I have belief in my body. I’ve got the metres under my legs. I’ve played a lot of five-set matches now, so I feel confident. I’m carrying some niggles here and there [he retired after seven games against Dominic Thiem in Nice two weeks ago to protect a sore right elbow] but that’s normal. All in all, I’m feeling good, feeling ready. I don’t really mind who I’m playing. At the end of the day, it’s just tennis, another opportunity to go out there and have fun.”</p> \n<p>If Kyrgios makes tennis look easy, Murray, for all his talent, sometimes turns it into a mild form of torture, although he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jan/27/andy-murray-defeats-nick-kyrgios-australian-open\" title=\"\">beat Kyrgios handily in the quarter-finals in Melbourne in January</a>. On that day, it was the Australian who suffered, in more ways than one.</p> \n<p>“At the Australian Open,” Kyrgios said, “my back was really bad. I had to take a couple of months off afterwards but I’m feeling way better than I felt then. If I can make the quarter-finals of the Australian Open with a bad back I can do some special things when healthy. I’m getting good physio every day, managing my load, managing how many serves I hit. I’m giving myself the best chance to go out there and feel comfortable with my body.”</p> \n<p>McEnroe expanded on why he thinks Kyrgios might just be “the one” to come through when the old order cracks for good. Part of his upbeat appraisal draws on the similarity he sees between Kyrgios and himself. “I had an earring briefly,” the former world No1 says, “not as big as his. What I see as a similarity is he’s got personality.</p> \n<p>“He’s got belief in himself. He brings something, you can feel it on the court. It’s not that we play the same game, the game he plays is unpredictable. He talks a lot, he’s out there expressing himself. I believe he’s got a shot at being the No1 player in the world in the next couple of years, certainly without question top five.”</p> \n<p>Murray respects and admires Kyrgios too – although he will leaven that in the heat of battle. “It is so hard to say how good someone can be,” he says. “But, from the young guys, he has had maybe the biggest results at the biggest events. That is a great start. He has always played well in the slams, he has always won matches in them – even when he got a wildcard the first time when he beat Radek Stepanek when he was pretty young. Wimbledon last year was a great run for him, a huge step. And he loves being in those positions.</p> \n<p>“But, how good can he be? I have no idea. He is already pretty good. He has had some great wins in some big events and it is just about maintaining that throughout the year in all competitions to build confidence and belief. He is going to be a great player but you never know how great someone can or will be.”</p> \n<p>Australia have not had 12 players in this tournament since 1999, and Kyrgios observes: “It’s very exciting. We’ve got six guys in the top 100, which is really good, and a lot of guys in qualies. It’s a positive, because we’re going to keep pushing each other.”</p> \n<p>On Wednesday Thanasi Kokkinakis pushed his fellow Australian Bernard Tomic all the way to five sets and out of the tournament, earning a showdown with the best player in the world, Novak Djokovic, in the other quarter on that side of the draw.</p> \n<p>Kyrgios’s favourite player on the Tour, though, is Ga&euml;l Monfils, admiration underlined in his own high-octane tennis. And in his explanation of why, he reveals much about himself. “He only plays the game because he loves it,” Kyrgios says. “He loves to entertain. He doesn’t worry about what others think. He plays how he wants to play.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/5/29/1432910472255/Nick-Kyrgios-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'I've got pretty high expectations for myself,' said the 20-year-old Australian Nick Kyrgios who plays Andy Murray in the third round at Roland Garros.
