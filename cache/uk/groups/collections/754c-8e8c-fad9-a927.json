He resisted pressure later to informally canonise his conqueror afterwards but he did say: “That’s definitely the best he served against me.” Federer agreed: “Definitely it was one of the best serving days of my career.”</p> \n<p>Federer’s greatness is not only delivered on his racket, though, or framed in mere statistics, but is forged in his heart and soul: he loves this game and winning so much that his insistence afterwards that revenge for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/06/novak-djokovic-wins-wimbledon-title-roger-federer\" title=\"\">losing in the final here last year to Djokovic</a> was not his prime motivation rang a little hollow. He wants to beat him as badly as he has wanted anything in the game in recent years. Djokovic is his new Rafa Nadal.</p> \n<p>“It’s great to play Novak anywhere these days,” he said, sounding vaguely nostalgic about some of their titanic battles. “Especially the last few years, he’s been unbelievably dominant.”</p> \n<p>He added, not entirely convincingly: “I don’t really think about the match we played against each other last year. I just remember it was unbelievably thrilling.&nbsp;The crowd really got into it. I’m just happy to be back in a final. Whoever&nbsp;that’s going to be against, it’s always a big occasion. That it is Novak, the world No1, it obviously adds something extra.”</p> \n<p>He added for the benefit of his audience of many millions: “I think the fans know why I’m playing. At the end of the day, I enjoy it. The game is bigger than any athletes we’ve ever had. It really is. I feel very much liked by many people around the world. It’s been amazing to have that support. It helps when you’ve been around the block for a long time. People sort of get to know you.”</p> \n<p>Victory would give him a record eighth Wimbledon title and 18th major, at 33 – and with at least a couple of years to come. He plays for love, but he loves trophies too, and reaching for those records against the best player in the world after being written off in many quarters as incapable of winning at the highest level again will provide him with all the incentive he needs.</p> \n<p>Murray, choosing to receive, did not get in front throughout the match but, after nearly breaking in the first game, he carried the fight to Federer all the way to the end of each set. The hub of the whole contest arrived in an astonishing struggle near the end of the second set. Murray saved five set points in 15 tortuous minutes of high-grade exchanges that left everyone breathless – followed by a swift and killing denouement by Federer to go two sets up.</p> \n<p>“He played some unbelievable shots, great retrieving,” Federer said of Murray. “I had my chances. I didn’t get down on myself. It’s a perfect game, regardless if I win or I lose. Even though you could see it in another way, as well, it was a key game for him to stay on and break my good run. It would have changed things around completely.</p> \n<p>But it did not. The extended moment mirrored the second game of the fourth set in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jan/22/andy-murray-out-roger-federer-australian-open\" title=\"\">2014 Australian Open quarter-final</a>, when Murray survived a 20-minute test of his resolve, only for Federer to hold to love in the next game and go on to take the match. Here his march to the line in the third set – at 33 minutes the shortest of the three – also had the air of inevitability about it at the end, Murray sticking a final forehand wide.</p> \n<p>But he left content – and that might not have been the case years ago. He has the look of a happy man – this was only his second defeat since marrying Kim Sears in April – and much to look forward to.</p> \n<p>“I got broken right at the end all of the sets,” he pointed out. “But I didn’t actually play a bad match. At times I played some very good tennis.</p> \n<p>He clearly deserved to win the match. He had more opportunities than me. If Roger serves in the final like he did today, he’ll give himself a great opportunity to win that match.</p> \n<p>“I was trying to fight as hard as I could. I served pretty well under pressure in that game. I served well – the best I served in the tournament.” And, as he has said many times before, he relishes his time in this era, maybe the strongest in the history of the game. And he reckons Federer has some miles left on the clock.</p> \n<p>“When he plays like that, he could play for a long time. You never know when the last time you’re going to play against him. It’s great that I get the opportunity to play against these guys.</p> \n<p>“This year so far has been my most consistent by far. In comparison to last year, it’s night and day. I’m playing so much better than then. It’s still an extremely tough time to win these major events because the guys that are around are phenomenal tennis players. But I do enjoy it.” With that, he wiped his brow and retired to an ice bath.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/10/andy-murray-roger-federer-wimbledon-2015-semi-final-live\">Roger Federer defeats Andy Murray: Wimbledon 2015 semi-final – live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-db5ccf46-971a-4203-a90b-83c37ef703ef\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436551109293/69c713ad-9c81-4176-82ac-d66cf8940bb7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"andy murray leaves\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murray wonders what happened.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shaun Botterill/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/novak-djokovic-richard-gasquet-wimbledon-final\">Novak Djokovic overpowers Richard Gasquet to reach Wimbledon final</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/10/1436550650984/andy-murray-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray congratulates Roger Federer after the Swiss handed out a tennis lesson on Centre Court.

The Chinese whispers told me it was Roger Federer at practice.</p> \n<p>Being tall can and cannot work in my favour and this time I praised the divine powers for giving me every final inch of my elongated lanky frame as I peered over to see the King himself. He hit balls with pedestrian brilliance, each the same as the last, yet of course it was pure art and every person who could lay their eyes on the court was transfixed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/andy-murray-beaten-roger-federer-wimbledon-semi-finals\">Andy Murray beaten by Roger Federer in straight sets in Wimbledon semi-final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The ability to make the brilliant look so very easy is one of the genuinely amazing features about the man. His coach, Stefan Edberg, looked on – purring in the sunshine. Champagne corks popped in the distance, the VIPs were out in force. All seemed well with the world on semi-finals day.</p> \n<p>So to the main event.</p> \n<p>The best players simply know where the service lines are, and it is impressive how they find the corners of the court at will. They have to, because when balls fall short of lines they are dispatched quickly. If Andy Murray doesn’t find depth on his hitting, Federer capitalises immediately, and will take his chance to attack and move to the net. The consistent accuracy is incredible to watch and that is the one aspect of professional sport we admire as spectators.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the more subtle aspect that we don’t always see is the variation, which becomes more evident live as opposed to coming from television. Watching the play on Friday afternoon it struck me immediately that the players at the top of the tree have so much variation in their game, finding and using different angles of shot.</p> \n<p>For the very best, awareness of the geometry of the game is heightened, and this ability singles them out. In tennis there are so many ways to hit the ball and the players don’t seem to play two shots the same, on the same line or with the same pace. This variation is key because it disturbs rhythms – and most players like rhythm in some form.</p> \n<p>Rallies would follow unique patterns, if there is such a thing. Fast-paced baseline hitting would unfold, but then the opening for a player would surface from a subtle changing of angle, a slightly nuanced racket impression on the ball. The players hit, hit, hit, and then the variation happens.</p> \n<p>Federer bides his time for as long as he needs to (his mind only can tell him how long that is), before deciding to throw in a shot with a completely different emphasis, which takes his opponent off balance and has him changing direction. The rhythm of the opponent is then broken, sometimes the rally is won. If not won then this type of play can at least bring the opening from which he can step up his attack.</p> \n<p>Novak Djokovic is also so adept at finding and playing trajectories of shot which get the opponent reaching away, stretching further on the shot, thus working harder and feeling more pressure. Again the rallies aren’t always won instantly, but the buildup of pressure begins to tell.</p> \n<p>The changing of angles and lines are hugely important, but so is the change of pace. In the arena you can sometimes hear the different sound of the ball coming off the strings on serve. They hardly hit the same serve twice. The angles will be different, the spin different, the pace different, and it all helps to keep the opponent guessing.</p> \n<p>Sameness in anything is not particularly desirable if you think about it. Apologies for the funny comparisons but when we eat food, we tend to find different textures please our palate more than the same type of food. When we listen to music we like a verse, bridge then chorus. When we watch a film we need lighter scenes to follow darker ones. It’s <em>chiaroscuro</em>. The same could be said for most sports I would think. A 1500m runner doesn’t just go and blast off. Instead he or she injects pace at certain points, slows down at certain points, and runs tactically.</p> \n<p>In sport rhythm is helpful to an opponent. Any opponent likes to know exactly where he or she is going. Federer and Djokovic know all about breaking rhythms and it will be fascinating to see who breaks the other first on Sunday.</p> \n<p>And if you want an example of a change of angle or variation, then watch 0-15 at 4-5 in the third set against Murray on Friday. That goes beyond any rules of geometry.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436560192569/Roger-Federer-v-Andy-Murr-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Making the brilliant look so very easy: Roger Federer during his semi-final victory over Britain's Andy Murray at Wimbledon.

The pitch is by no means unplayable (more than 1,000 runs have been scored in three innings so far), and the imperative for Australia to get their skates on is not there. But having done much of the hard work, England will kick themselves if they do not win from here.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/10/ian-bells-show-of-bravura-lights-the-way-for-new-englands-great-entertainers\">Ian Bell lights way | Vic Marks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Once more, that part of a session aside, England were outstanding, the confidence running through the side palpable. In the first 75 minutes of play the three seamers, using first the old ball and then the new, disposed of the last five Australian wickets for 44 runs to establish an important first innings lead of 122.</p> \n<p>That they then lost the wickets of Alastair Cook and Gary Ballance to the new ball, as they set about the task of establishing what they hoped would prove an unassailable lead on a pitch that is starting to play a few more tricks, proved of little consequence as Ian Bell and Adam Lyth, instead of battening down the hatches as once might have been the reaction, went on the counterattack, pasting 50 runs in the next seven overs, in a manner that was once the domain of their opponent.</p> \n<p>Then, when Lyth edged an off-spinner to be brilliantly caught at slip for 37, Joe Root was able to continue in the same vein, adding 97 with Bell before the latter was bowled by Johnson for a beautiful 60 that contained 11 fours, creamed through extra cover for the most part. Johnson had almost burst himself in the effort of seeking his first wicket of the match and had already conceded 160 runs in the quest. His celebration, puffing his cheeks out, was more one of relief than anything.</p> \n<p>Root was to go on to make 60 as well, and from an identical 89 balls, before he too was bowled, this time by Josh Hazlewood, the ball coming back sharply off the seam in a manner that has unsettled batsmen the whole game, even when apparently well set. But he had played yet another delightful innings, with nine fours, the best of them a classical bent-knee cover drive off Johnson that bisected the cover field precisely before they had a chance to move.</p> \n<p>Even Root was outdone by Bell’s strokeplay, in what must have been a cathartic innings for him. Since he scored a fine 143 in the first innings of the opening Test in Antigua in April, he had fallen on hard times, nine further innings producing 56 runs, and with a first-innings failure in Cardiff, there were already mutterings about his right to a place in the team. Here he simply seized the initiative, and, in so doing, seemed to release the shackles that had been imposed on Lyth.</p> \n<p>If there was one thing that really separated the two teams in the last series it was the capacity of the Australians to blow away the England lower order, with Johnson pre-eminent as the enforcer of this, while England were generally powerless to do the same themselves.</p> \n<p>Certainly when play began, with Australia still 166 adrift but with five wickets in hand, including that of Shane Watson and the bete noire Brad Haddin, they understood that anything near parity would keep them very much in the contest. So the response of Stuart Broad, Wood and, when the new ball became due after 10 overs, Jimmy Anderson was superb.</p> \n<p>Watson, one of the two not-out batsmen overnight, is well known for a tendency to plant his front foot and hit around it, making him vulnerable to lbw, and the scenario duly played out. Broad’s fourth ball of the day was full and thudded into Watson’s front pad – and, after a Bucknorish deliberation, Marais Erasmus raised his finger. Of course Watson reviewed – he almost always does as if unable to grasp that he might be out in this fashion – and the decision was upheld by a slender margin. Immediately afterwards, Wood produced a full delivery that caught Lyon bang in front and two wickets had gone for the addition of one run.</p> \n<p>For a brief while, as Cook replaced Broad with Ben Stokes to give him a breather for the new ball and Wood gave way to Moeen for a single over, there was a hint of deja vu as Haddin took three successive boundaries from Stokes and Johnson clobbered Moeen over the top. Use of the new ball is a vital element in this match, however, and Anderson and Broad both used it immaculately.</p> \n<p>The wicket of Haddin was a key one, edging a perfect away-swinger to Jos Buttler, and then Johnson, thinking he had clipped Broad nicely away through square leg, realised he had merely hit gently to Ballance. Anderson, round the wicket to the left-handed Hazlewood, took the final wicket, an excellent catch by Root.

Albeit, only to those unfamiliar with the work of Brad Haddin, hammer of the English throughout the 5-0 whitewash in Australia two winters ago and a venerable, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2014/jan/03/ashes-2013-14-england-australia-brad-haddin\" title=\"\">lurking bogeyman</a> during the buildup to this series.</p> \n<p>For all that, the suspicion of a slight dwindling away, of a congealing of that familiar menace was already out there. Haddin’s non-appearance on the second evening here at the fall of Adam Voges’ wicket had struck a slightly jarring note, Nathan Lyon’s appearance in the gloaming an abandonment of Waugh’s First Dictum, which states that night-watchmen are essentially un-manly, limp, craven, English, an admission – horror of all horrors – of some fatal tremor of self-doubt.</p> \n<p>There was, though, good reason for protecting Australia’s No7. Most obviously to preserve just a little longer the unscabbed wounds of the last series when Haddin was Australia’s mid-innings executioner throughout, a glowering, cuffing, hoicking booby-trap lurking between the top six and lower orders. This was the pattern of Haddin’s Ashes last time out, when the wicketkeeper just kept on bailing them out from No7 right through to Sydney in January where a score of 97 for five was biffed and crashed up to a rollicking 326. It was, for all Mitchell Johnson’s fire and craft, a series-defining turn and Haddin might have retired after that. He is already the fourth most-capped Australia wicketkeeper after the modern giants Rod Marsh, Adam Gilchrist and Ian Healy. He wanted a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/29/australia-new-zealand-world-cup-final\" title=\"\">World Cup</a>, which he got. And he wanted another shot in England, where he has known only defeat.</p> \n<p>Australia will still fancy their chances in this Test and beyond, but as far as Haddin’s own contributions to this powerful team go there is a palpable dwindling of influence since that last Ashes series. In 12 Tests since Sydney 2014, Haddin averages 15. Keeping wicket here he was late getting down to a nasty, dipping edge off Joe Root before England’s first-day centurion had scored. Chuck in numerous byes on a tough, up and down pitch and an unfavourable critic might conclude Haddin’s net contribution to the cause before he had batted here was minus 151. Here he came out to bat at 265 for six, Shane Watson having been dismissed lbw to give Stuart Broad his first wicket. As ever Watson looked devastated, crushed, genuinely shocked to be given out, as though unaware until now such a thing was actually possible.</p> \n<p>It should perhaps comes as less of surprise these days. Watson has been described as not so much an lbw candidate as duly-elected life president of the international lbw association. Given the prominence here of that familiar broad front pad it is clearly a role he intends to see right through to his last available breath.</p> \n<p>At which point: enter the gloveman. Haddin marched out with a familiar menacing jauntiness, a cricketer made for these kind of occasions, and bolstered by the muscle memory of all those bruising mid-innings counterattacks. He almost went second ball, jumping into line as Broad dropped short and seeing the ball bounce down not far from the stumps. Broad held his head in his hands. Haddin grinned a horrible grin. This is probably a tautology. Unless otherwise stated it is safe to assume Haddin will be grinning a horrible grin at all stages in this series. No doubt Haddin would grin a horrible grin just before you lowered him on a makeshift scaffold into a bubbling vat of magma. Before long, Mark Wood trapped Lyon lbw, hurtling in off his short somersaulting run and performing a gleeful little dance as the finger went up. At which point Haddin was joined by Johnson, twin hammers of the last Ashes series. Haddin, though, is the real heart of this team, as Australian wicketkeepers so often are, squatting behind the stumps and accumulating, oyster-like, all that free-floating bile and grizzle and Pommie-snarl.</p> \n<p>Here he was scratchy early on. Still quite clearly the same Brad. But less so somehow, a Haddin tribute act without that same extra little breath to play his shots, hurried a little even in defence. It took 16 balls to get off the mark with an edged pull just past his leg stump off Ben Stokes, with whom there is a little history. Stokes had Haddin out off a no-ball in Australia. Haddin, diligent as ever, has never let him forget it. The next ball was driven with scalding power past short mid-off, followed by another slash to third man. And suddenly, gears still crunching, cam belt smoking , engine revving, Haddin was playing a little bit like Haddin again.</p> \n<p>Not for long. Jimmy Anderson had taken the new ball with Broad and suddenly Haddin looked, if not all at sea, then certainly queasy. There was a horrible two-footed lash of a front-foot drive before Anderson got him with the score on 304, Haddin hanging his bat out at an away-swinger, feet only halfway there and nicking behind. Out prodding, not slashing or carting or heaving: it was a most un-Brad-like end, albeit to the bowler who has dismissed him more than any other in Tests.</p> \n<p>For the rest of the day, Haddin was back in his familiar role as conductor of the cordon, troubled at times by the uneven bounce, but otherwise he stood behind the stumps in that attitude of distinctive, lounging menace, arms crossed, brain always ticking.</p> \n<p>Nothing has been settled in this match, let alone the series. Haddin is too fine a player, too gnarly an opponent to go without a last flex of the muscles somewhere along the way. For now though England will cling to the first hint here of a familiar ghost perhaps in the process of being banished.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436549526968/England-v-Australia---Inv-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's James Anderson celebrates taking the wicket of Australia's Brad Haddin.

Whether they are winners remains to be seen. Their response to being 22 for two prompted the rubbing of eyes. Suddenly there was the danger of frittering away their hard-won advantage. What happened next?</p> \n<p>Well, Australia bowled a few half-volleys but even so it was remarkable that Ian Bell and Adam Lyth should crack 49 runs in five overs. This has not always been the traditional response of English batsmen to a bit of a crisis.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/england-australia-ashes-first-test-day-three-report\">England play a risky game but victory target still looks beyond Australia</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Historically they have been more inclined to batten down all available hatches. They used to say of Trevor Bailey, who in the 1950s played in one of the most successful England sides, that he always batted not necessarily as if there was a crisis but as if there was certainly one around the corner.</p> \n<p>In a curious way the situation might have helped Bell. This was his 10th innings since his 143 in Antigua and in that time he had not reached 30; he had rarely found double figures. So there was a personal crisis on the horizon, yet somehow England’s plight in what is fast becoming a riveting Test superseded that. The match had taken over and “cricket is a situation game” as Bailey always used to say. There was no time for Bell to fret about his own plight. This contest was hotting up.</p> \n<p>So the cover drives flowed from Bell’s bat. He plays that shot exquisitely – except when it lands up at second slip – and Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood kept feeding it. Bell purred and briefly Lyth joined in. The crisis passed rather quickly.</p> \n<p>Bell reached 30 at a run a ball with those cover drives and two aerial leg-side strokes against Nathan Lyon – a slog/sweep seems too coarse a description for any shot played by Bell.</p> \n<p>Having asserted himself and restored the situation he then reined himself in a little but there were still breathtaking shots. A little push of a cover drive against Hazlewood startled everyone at Cardiff including Lyon diving forlornly at cover point. One aerial drive against Mitchell Johnson even hinted at violence. England – or should we say “New England” (even though Trevor Bayliss does not appear to have many points of comparison with Tony Blair) – were back on course. So, too, was the Test match career of Bell.</p> \n<p>Actually in their 85 overs in the field when Australia were batting in their first innings Alastair Cook’s bowlers were very reminiscent of old England, in particular the teams of 2009 and 2010-11. The seamers bowled with fine discipline, in patches tying down batsmen who subsequently surrendered their wickets. They bided their time if necessary, nibbling away before Jimmy Anderson polished off the tail with his own special touch of artistry.</p> \n<p>Anderson and Stuart Broad have done this before. Mark Wood, with unquenchable enthusiasm and considerable skill, looks a more than willing pupil. Even Ben Stokes was economical, apart from an over against Brad Haddin when the old Australian keeper struck three consecutive fours. Moeen Ali had been more expensive yet had managed to remove Australia’s two most vaunted batsmen. England seized their chances expertly.</p> \n<p>Perhaps Australia have been duped. They were cunningly dispatched to Canterbury and Chelmsford before the series to play against second division sides, who were resting their senior bowlers, on pitches designed to ensure that the contest lasted four days and that the coffers were filled. The Australians piled up 507 for eight against Kent and 562 against Essex, up against the respective talents of Matt Hunn, 21, and Jamie Porter, 22.</p> \n<p>At Cardiff there has been a reminder of the gulf between what happens at county level compared with the Test arena. Here the bowling was in a different league from anything previously encountered by the Australians on this tour. Anderson, in particular, offered nothing to hit when bowling with an old ball and as a consequence the batsmen did not look so battle-hardened. After a few maidens, an experience not encountered at Canterbury or Chelmsford, they grew fidgety and made mistakes.</p> \n<p>The English bowlers were performing at a level seldom seen in county cricket. In part this is because the pitches in domestic cricket this season often do not require great bowling skills. As Sam Northeast, who has been captaining Kent, correctly pointed out after his side’s recent victory over Leicestershire at Grace Road, there are too many “result” pitches around at the moment.</p> \n<p>This pitch in Cardiff has not pleased Australia’s coach, Darren Lehmann, greatly. Before the start of play he shared his thoughts. “Obviously they’ve tried to negate the pace with the way the wicket has been prepared. That’s the way it was in 2013. The only disappointing thing is that I think fast bowlers running in being able to bowl a bouncer is one of the parts of the game that is exciting.”</p> \n<p>An Olympian purist with the broadest of perspectives might agree with Lehmann. The ideal cricket pitch should have more pace than this. But this is a typical Cardiff surface.</p> \n<p>Conspiracy theories are in abeyance until Lord’s. If the pitch is sluggish there, they can be aired with greater justification. There is nothing wrong with this Test track. It offers more to the seamers than anticipated; there has been some turn for the spinners. Wickets have fallen. It has negated the bouncer. And it suits England more than Australia.</p> \n<p>But shots can be played on this pitch and the runs can flow, as demonstrated by that dependable, old cavalier, Joe Root, and the resurgent Bell.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436550810549/Ian-Bell-005.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England’s Ian Bell acknowledges the crowd after reaching his 50 against Australia in Cardiff.

Towards the end of a preposterously up-and-down week for his Etixx-Quick-Step team, the 30-year-old sprinter latched on to the wheel of one rider and riskily barged another out of his way en route to victory by half a bike length on the Boulevard des D&eacute;port&eacute;s in Foug&egrave;res. What could have been another boulevard of broken dreams for the Manxman will live in the memory as the scene of a much-needed triumph.</p> \n<p>“I’m very happy,” he said. “The guys could have given up on me after messing up the last two sprints. I’ve been too anxious and I’ve gone too early. If anything I went too late here but Greipel got the jump and I was perfect on him. He could have closed the door on me but he didn’t. He sprinted straight because he’s a gentleman.” Holding his young daughter Delilah in his arms, Cavendish could not help but laugh. “She understands what’s going on now,” he said. “She was angry I didn’t get the bunch of flowers the other day, so she’s happier now.”</p> \n<p>Stage seven was on the flat from Normandy to Brittany through the Mayenne <em>d&eacute;partement</em>, in sweltering heat with hardly a breeze. With limited opportunities remaining and his team-mate Tony Martin forced to withdraw from the race with a broken collarbone, the absence of such a vital cog in the Etixx-Quick-Step lead-out wheel might have scuppered any hopes Cavendish had of winning a stage. Happy to improvise in the closing stages, he played a waiting game, tucking on to Greipel’s wheel before muscling his way through a gap left by John Degenkolb and Peter Sagan to cross the line punching the air in triumph.</p> \n<p>Even though Martin finished Thursday’s stage with a compound fracture, it actually seemed something of a surprise when he failed to sign on in Le Havre. Despite being <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/tour-de-france-2015-tony-martin-race-in-doubt-stage-six-crash-zdenek-stybar-cycling\" title=\"\">nursed over the line in the French port</a>, the German they call “Panzerwagen” found time to chat cordially with team-mates and look after his media responsibilities before attending to the more gruesome and, one would think, more pressing concern that was the shattered collarbone poking through the skin of his shoulder. Were it not for strict doctor’s orders, one suspects he would almost certainly have begun this stage.</p> \n<p>“I will follow the race on TV today from the hospital,” he said from Hamburg, after undergoing surgery. “It will be strange but that’s life and cycling.

I won a stage and wore the yellow jersey for the first time in my career.”</p> \n<p>In Martin’s absence Chris Froome took over as race leader but did not don the yellow jersey until after the stage, as dictated by historical precedent and the president of the commissaires’ panel. Indeed, even if Froome had been given the option of wearing the <em>maillot jaune</em>, the Sky rider said it is not a garment in which he would have felt comfortable under the circumstances. “Out of respect for Tony I would never have worn it in any case,” he said. “That’s not the way to get the yellow jersey due to someone else’s misfortunes. I was second on the GC so there was no way to wear it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4cbdfc65d07623ce35d3f164876143b095e86b4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436554043922/c143a0c6-6212-4b6f-9529-b7f1ed1765eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Cavendish\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Cavendish celebrates his stage win.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Tim de Waele/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the red and white polka dot corner, the Eritrean rider <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/tour-de-france-daniel-teklehaimanot-africa-eritrea-cycling\" title=\"\">Daniel Teklehaimanot</a> was the proudest man in France as he made history by becoming the first black African to reign as king of the mountains.

Since <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/novak-djokovic-kevin-anderson-wimbledon-2015\" title=\"\">coming from two sets down in the fourth round against the big-serving Kevin Anderson</a>, he has not dropped a set and just as he did 12 months ago, when he also missed out in Paris, his mental fortitude looks rock solid.</p> \n<p>“It was a very good performance, considering the occasion,” Djokovic said. “Richard had a great tournament, deserved to be in the semis and things could have gone his way in the first set. That was the turning point, for me. I’m just glad to be in another final. There will be a lot at stake but I’m going to be ready.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/08/wimbledon-2015-richard-gasquet-stan-wawrinka\" title=\"\">Having beaten Wawrinka in the previous round</a>, Gasquet had been trying to reach his first final here, revelling in the role of the underdog and hoping to catch the world No1 napping. Once he had lost the first-set tie-break 7-2, however, he never looked likely to turn it around against a man who is among the best frontrunners in the business. Early breaks in each of the three sets left him always playing catchup, and any time Gasquet had a glimmer of hope, Djokovic sent down a big serve, ripped a forehand winner or slipped a pass beyond the Frenchman’s reach.</p> \n<p>Gasquet said afterwards that he had felt under pressure throughout because of the quality of the Djokovic return. “He never misses,” he said. “All the time, you serve, you serve. The ball is always on your side again. It’s very difficult. You never make so many aces. He doesn’t make unforced errors. Even from the baseline he’s playing fast with a lot of aggression and takes the ball early. That’s why he’s the world No1.”</p> \n<p>The sickening thing for Gasquet, who will nevertheless move up seven places to No13 in the rankings, is that he was the better player in the opening set. Having dropped his opening service game, he broke back for 2-1 and at 4-4 missed a simple smash that would have put him 0-30 up. In the tie-break, two loose forehands gave Djokovic a 5-2 lead and he closed it out 7-2. The match was easy on the eye but there is a reason why Djokovic has lost to Gasquet only once, way back in 2007. With the exception of net play, the world No1 is slightly better in almost every element of the game, holding his own against the venomous Gasquet one-handed backhand, which drew gasps from the crowd on several occasions.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14bae73ffff97e43eaf89cf76c4c4cbc9b9f6683\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436540117089/344d28db-0221-4862-ab72-cdd795e1c3e7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Novak Djokovic celebrates after securing his place in the 2015 Wimbledon final.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Novak Djokovic celebrates after securing his place in the 2015 Wimbledon final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suzanne Plunkett/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At this level, one shot is rarely enough and there was a sense of inevitability about the outcome. The 11-1 head-to-head record in Djokovic’s favour did not help but early breaks in each set meant the Frenchman was playing catchup, never able to relax as the Serb pinned him behind the baseline with the power of his serve and depth of his groundstrokes.</p> \n<p>An exquisite backhand pass gave Djokovic the break for 2-0 in the second set and he saved two break points in the fourth game, holding the advantage throughout to double his lead, serving out the set from 15-30 with the help of two aces. In the third set, Gasquet slashed a backhand wide to give Djokovic another early break for 2-1 and, although the Frenchman saved two match points as he held for 4-5, Djokovic finished off with a ruthless love game.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/10/novak-djokovic-richard-gasquet-wimbledon-2015-semi-final-live\">Novak Djokovic beats Richard Gasquet to reach Wimbledon final –&nbsp;as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Djokovic consulted the trainer twice over what he later said was a “stiff shoulder” but said it would not affect the outcome.

It wasn’t. Today’s semi-final will be his first here since that defeat to Roger Federer eight years ago and only his third at a grand slam, having reached the last four at the US Open in 2013.</p> \n<p> So what happened to the player who, at the age of nine, was pictured on the front of France’s leading tennis magazine with the headline “The champion that France is waiting for?”, and was hailed as “Baby Federer” during the early years of his professional career? Despite possessing a one-handed backhand that could probably convert even the most hardened tennis disbeliever, Gasquet has lacked similar mental and physical attributes; his collapses from two sets to love up against Andy Murray in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/jun/30/andymurraylive\">2008</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2010/may/24/andy-murray-richard-gasquet-live\">2010</a> being two cases in point.</p> \n<p>But then on Wednesday the narrative changed. Gasquet defeated Stan Wawrinka, the French Open champion and last year’s Australian Open winner, 11-9 in a deciding set. He’d blinked under the pressure of serving for the match at 5-3, but he’d recovered to secure one of the biggest victories of his career.</p> \n<p>Can one match make a man? At 29, perhaps it’s too late for Gasquet to fulfil his talent. But he proved many doubters wrong and probably even proved something to himself against Wawrinka. Even if he loses today against Novak Djokovic (which is the most likely outcome), hopefully what he’ll take from this Wimbledon is self-belief. It’s something Djokovic, of course, has in spades.</p> \n<p><strong>The players will be on court at:</strong> 1pm BST. Don’t be late.</p>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-559faf7fe4b07fc6a121f729","publishedDateTime":"2015-07-10T11:44:38Z","body":"<p>I linked to this the other day but in case you missed it, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzKuv4j67aw\">here’s proof</a> of just how good Gasquet was as a youngster.

I think he improved a lot. I heard he worked hard to get himself really fit and ready to go the distance, and it’s paying off. He always had a touch, he always had the talent. He loves playing on grass.

It wasn’t. Today’s semi-final will be his first here since that defeat to Roger Federer eight years ago and only his third at a grand slam, having reached the last four at the US Open in 2013.</p> \n<p> So what happened to the player who, at the age of nine, was pictured on the front of France’s leading tennis magazine with the headline “The champion that France is waiting for?”, and was hailed as “Baby Federer” during the early years of his professional career? Despite possessing a one-handed backhand that could probably convert even the most hardened tennis disbeliever, Gasquet has lacked similar mental and physical attributes; his collapses from two sets to love up against Andy Murray in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/jun/30/andymurraylive\">2008</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2010/may/24/andy-murray-richard-gasquet-live\">2010</a> being two cases in point.</p> \n<p>But then on Wednesday the narrative changed. Gasquet defeated Stan Wawrinka, the French Open champion and last year’s Australian Open winner, 11-9 in a deciding set. He’d blinked under the pressure of serving for the match at 5-3, but he’d recovered to secure one of the biggest victories of his career.</p> \n<p>Can one match make a man? At 29, perhaps it’s too late for Gasquet to fulfil his talent. But he proved many doubters wrong and probably even proved something to himself against Wawrinka. Even if he loses today against Novak Djokovic (which is the most likely outcome), hopefully what he’ll take from this Wimbledon is self-belief. It’s something Djokovic, of course, has in spades.</p> \n<p><strong>The players will be on court at:</strong> 1pm BST.
