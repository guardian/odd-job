For all there has been criticism of this venue, and plenty of it, two marquee names are the most prominent. <br /></p> \n<p>Spieth’s 67 on day two and a 69 for Reed leaves them tied at five under. They will thereby partner each other on Saturday, just like Perthshire but this time in direct combat. Branden Grace and Dustin Johnson lie a stroke further back in what may now become a mass attempt to tread water; only 16 players in the field are under par. Poor greens and what is expected to be a ferocious course set-up means low scoring over the weekend is highly unlikely at best. </p> \n<p>“I actually felt it was a pretty disappointing round,” said Reed. “To have five or six bogeys, I didn’t get up and down once, I was 0% on up-and-downs today. But we’re in a good position and we hopefully can have a good weekend and have a chance to win.</p> \n<p>“Anytime I play with Jordan I enjoy it. The main thing for me is to stay focused and focus on what I need to do to play some good golf. And plot my way around this golf course, especially if it gets firmer and faster.”</p> \n<p>Rory McIlroy faces a battle to play himself into contention. The world No1 started day two at two over par, a situation he had improved by one when reaching the 17th tee. McIlroy promptly four-putted the penultimate hole for a double bogey and dropped another shot at the last. Back to back rounds of 72 are hardly disastrous at this venue but, at nine shots adrift of the lead, McIlroy will find it difficult to make up ground. He has endured a particularly frustrating time on the greens. </p> \n<p>The defending champion Martin Kaymer was amongst the high profile names in the Friday afternoon wave of play to miss the cut, which was only confirmed at plus five after 9pm local time on Friday. When it finally was, an agonising bogey on his final hole by the 19-year-old amateur Nick Hardy meant a batch of high profile players survived for the weekend. Colin Montgomerie, Angel Cabrera, Ian Poulter, Jimmy Walker and Sergio Garcia were amongst that relieved group. So, too, was the Scottish qualifier Jimmy Gunn. </p> \n<p>Earlier on Friday, Jason Day’s management team issued an updated statement which confirmed the Australian retains hope of completing the Open. Day caused alarm when he collapsed in the final hole of his second round.</p> \n<p>It read: “Jason was diagnosed to have suffered from benign positional vertigo. He was treated locally by Dr Robert Stoecker and Dr Charles Souliere and is resting comfortably. His condition is being monitored closely and he is hopeful he will be able to compete this weekend in the final rounds of the US Open. </p> \n<p>“He wants to thank all who treated him at the Franciscan Medical Group and thank all of the fans and friends who have reached out to he and his family.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a107fe50701b44065b18ad8376dea53b37f782f5/0_334_4096_2459/4096.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2459,"width":4096,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Erik S.

Oosthuizen shot 77. Woods took 80. Fowler carded 81. It wouldn’t have been much worse had you sent <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/sep/19/golf.rydercup\">Maurice Flitcroft</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2011/jul/15/joy-of-six-open-nightmares\">Walter Danecki</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2012/apr/06/joy-of-six-golf-holes\">Angelo Spagnolo</a> out together.</p> \n<p><strong>Oosthuizen’s seven-over 77 seems a common-or-garden mishap compared to the other two scores.</strong> First, Fowler’s 81. Only Rich Berberian Jr. had a worse day, shooting 83. He’s a club pro. Fowler is the current Players champion, and was one of the favourites to win this week. Here’s Fowler’s finishes in the last five majors: tied 5th, tied 2nd, tied 2nd, tied 3rd and tied 12th. After yesterday’s fiasco, he’s currently in 155th place out of 156. And in case we forget, his 81 featured an eagle! He was an inch or so away from a hole-in-one albatross at the par-four 12th! Golf, huh?</p> \n<p><strong>But of course it’s the travails of Tiger which have hogged most of the limelight.</strong> His 80 is his worst-ever round at a US Open. He’s driving like a maniac, making Severiano Ballesteros look like Calvin Peete. He hit six of 14 fairways yesterday. He missed the widest fairway in US Open history by the best part of 50 yards. One shot saw his club fly 20 yards back down the hole. And on the 18th, he topped a fairway wood into a pot bunker like a rank amateur. When he disappeared from view to play the sand shot, the gallery exploded into laughter. There was a ripple of ironic applause when he splashed the ball back out. The man should suffer no more indignity. But of course he’s got another 18 holes to play this morning. God speed, Tiger Woods.</p> \n<p><strong>All of which has somewhat overshadowed the fine efforts of Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, Matt Kuchar, Ben Martin and the 22-year-old amateur Brian Campbell, who head the leaderboard after a memorable first round.</strong> A tip of the hat to those lads, then, but you know how it is sometimes.

Oosthuizen shot 77. Woods took 80. Fowler carded 81. It wouldn’t have been much worse had you sent <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2008/sep/19/golf.rydercup\">Maurice Flitcroft</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2011/jul/15/joy-of-six-open-nightmares\">Walter Danecki</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2012/apr/06/joy-of-six-golf-holes\">Angelo Spagnolo</a> out together.</p> \n<p><strong>Oosthuizen’s seven-over 77 seems a common-or-garden mishap compared to the other two scores.</strong> First, Fowler’s 81. Only Rich Berberian Jr. had a worse day, shooting 83. He’s a club pro. Fowler is the current Players champion, and was one of the favourites to win this week. Here’s Fowler’s finishes in the last five majors: tied 5th, tied 2nd, tied 2nd, tied 3rd and tied 12th. After yesterday’s fiasco, he’s currently in 155th place out of 156.

Golf, huh?</p> \n<p><strong>But of course it’s the travails of Tiger which have hogged most of the limelight.</strong> His 80 is his worst-ever round at a US Open. He’s driving like a maniac, making Severiano Ballesteros look like Calvin Peete. He hit six of 14 fairways yesterday. He missed the widest fairway in US Open history by the best part of 50 yards. One shot saw his club fly 20 yards back down the hole. And on the 18th, he topped a fairway wood into a pot bunker like a rank amateur. When he disappeared from view to play the sand shot, the gallery exploded into laughter. There was a ripple of ironic applause when he splashed the ball back out. The man should suffer no more indignity. But of course he’s got another 18 holes to play this morning. God speed, Tiger Woods.</p> \n<p><strong>All of which has somewhat overshadowed the fine efforts of Dustin Johnson, Henrik Stenson, Patrick Reed, Matt Kuchar, Ben Martin and the 22-year-old amateur Brian Campbell, who head the leaderboard after a memorable first round.</strong> A tip of the hat to those lads, then, but you know how it is sometimes.

In the summer of 2013, on the back of two undistinguished and largely unheralded loan spells at Leicester and Norwich, Harry Kane was England’s main striker in the Under-20 World Cup in Turkey. Now he is once again leading the line for his country in an international youth tournament but this time, here at the European Under-21 Championship, his preceding season involved a deluge of goals for Tottenham Hotspur and a full England debut.</p> \n<p>Whereas the 2013 Kane enjoyed relative anonymity the 2015 version cannot walk the 100 yards or so from the team hotel in Olomouc to the Legionarska training ground next door without fielding requests for autographs and photos. On Spurs’ tour of Asia and Australia last month a stroll to a Sydney shopping centre had to be abandoned when hordes of fans mobbed Kane and two team-mates en route. There is a Twitter campaign aimed at making him the man to join Lionel Messi on the front cover of the <a href=\"https://www.easports.com/uk/fifa/cover-vote/\" title=\"\">Fifa 16 video game</a>.</p> \n<p>England will hope that the differences are not only off the field. In Turkey Peter Taylor’s Under-20s failed to win a game and finished bottom of a group that also included Chile, Egypt and Iraq. Kane could have been forgiven had the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/18/england-portugal-european-under-21-championship\" title=\"\">opening defeat for the Under-21s</a> against Portugal in Uherske Hradiste on Thursday raised the spectre of tournaments past but the 21-year-old remains confident the team can recover and return to winning ways against Sweden on Sunday.</p> \n<p>“We were 2-0 up and in cruise control mode [against Iraq],” said Kane. “They got a penalty, then ended up scoring in the last minute. As a group that hit us hard and we never really recovered. We drew with Chile in the next game but it isn’t going to happen in this group. We’ve got too many experienced players who have been there before and done it not to put it right. We know what we have to do.”</p> \n<p>His development since that troublesome tournament in Turkey has been rapid and the trappings accompanying new-found fame at times mind-boggling. Kane describes that shopping trip in Sydney as the most surreal experience of his career – the players had to make their escape back to the team hotel by hopping on to a coach, which was fortunately nearby – but is unflustered by the attention.</p> \n<p>“I don’t mind it,” he said. “Obviously it’s just the start for me. Maybe in the years to come I’ll get a bit grumpy but no, it’s fine. I’ve always been happy to talk to fans, to do things with fans. Sometimes you don’t know how far they’ve travelled just to meet you. So if you don’t sign something or don’t talk to them it could be heartbreaking for them.</p> \n<p>“I was a fan once and I’d always want someone I’ve looked up to to be a nice guy and that’s what I try and be. I don’t think that will ever change. I think I’ll always sign stuff for fans and take pictures because I know how much it means.”</p> \n<p>Kane’s focus for the next few days, though, will be on keeping England in the tournament. Against Portugal there were moments when a gap in class was apparent. For example, when Monaco’s Bernardo Silva and Sporting’s Jo&atilde;o M&aacute;rio, both of whom played Champions League football last season, were breaking past Nathaniel Chalobah, who ended the season at Reading, and on towards Middlesbrough’s Ben Gibson and Leicester’s Liam Moore in the centre of the England defence. But the gap was not as big as those CVs suggest. And Rui Jorge’s side were arguably the most impressive of the eight here in the first round of matches.</p> \n<p>Sweden, who beat Italy despite being reduced to 10 men and went 1-0 down after 28 minutes, offer a different threat, a more direct, muscular and – whisper it – typically English approach in their 4-4-2 formation. That could allow greater freedom for Tom Carroll in the central attacking midfield role and, in the wide positions, Nathan Redmond and Alex Pritchard, who may replace Jesse Lingard in the starting XI after impressing as a late substitute on Thursday.</p> \n<p>The chief aim, though, for Gareth Southgate’s side must be to get more support to Kane, who cut an occasionally isolated figure against Portugal. He denies his team-mates look to him as England’s main man – “We have a lot of players in this squad that have done well this season for their clubs; I am just one of them” – but on the occasions he was able to find space on the ball against Portugal he proved his threat, with one fizzing effort from distance particularly troubling Jos&eacute; S&aacute; in the Portugal goal.</p> \n<p>In the absence of the injured Saido Berahino, top scorer in qualifying, Kane’s goal threat becomes even more vital. Although Kane is confident this squad will not crumble under the pressure, five straight defeats at these finals is a worrying trend and one that needs to end. “We are not panicking,” said Kane. “We know what we have to do.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/6/19/1434738578279/Harry-Kane-and-his-Englan-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Harry Kane and his England Under-21 team-mates get to grips with training in readiness to face Sweden.

When the Scot survived a searching three-set examination by one of the big serving beasts of tennis, Gilles M&uuml;ller, at Queen’s on Friday, he probably imagined he would be meeting another ace merchant, John Isner, in Saturday’ssemi-final but instead he gets the Serb, who upset the beanpole American in quick time on Friday evening – and seriously upset Murray when he failed to provide a blood sample at Monte Carlo two years ago.</p> \n<p>After Troicki was banned for 18 months – reduced to a year on appeal – Murray described his conduct as “unprofessional”, a judgment he was happy to stand by on Friday, and even expand on.</p> \n<p>“I think players realise that it’s extremely serious business, drug testing,” Murray said after beating M&uuml;ller 3-6, 7-6, 6-4, then watching some of his upcoming opponent’s 7-6, 6-3 win over Isner in just 62 minutes.</p> \n<p>“I know that I’m getting tested a lot more than I was in the past. If you want the public to take your sport seriously, you need to have strong anti-doping protocols and make sure that all of the athletes are getting tested as much as possible.</p> \n<p>“I’m not saying that it’s perfect. I don’t think any of the sports are. You need more money, more investment in it if you want to have the best protocol possible. I’m pro testing as much as is required to make sure the sport remains as clean as possible.”</p> \n<p>Asked did he stand by his original criticism of Troicki, he said: “Obviously it’s a difficult situation. I said at the time you have to be aware of what exactly the rules are. If you want to protect the image of your sport, you need to understand how serious the drug testing is and anti-doping is. I stand by what I said there. I’m sure he’s learned a lot from that.”</p> \n<p>The case has been a sore point between Murray and Novak Djokovic, who defended his Serbian compatriot at the time and since. Now Murray plays Troicki for the second time in that period, having beaten him handily in Vienna last October.</p> \n<p>After the earlier exits in the Aegon Championships of Rafael Nadal, the new French Open champion Stan Wawrinka and the Queen’s incumbent Grigor Dimitrov, insurrection was in the air. M&uuml;ller – who had not beaten Murray in three previous matches and has fought back from injury two years ago under the stewardship of Murray’s close tennis friend, Jamie Delgado, to No48 in the world – rose admirably to the challenge.</p> \n<p>Having racked up 56 aces on the way to the quarter-finals, M&uuml;ller powered down on his serve in search of accuracy, and indeed Murray edged him 13-8 in free points in just under two hours on a packed Centre Court, the club’s elegant patrons and guests bathing in the warm sun while watching a spot of tennis between deals and Pimm’s.</p> \n<p>For the combatants, it was not such a picnic. While the man from Luxembourg red-lined near the edge of his abilities, it was a struggle for Murray until he found another gear in the tie-break and steadily gained the ascendancy in the closing set.</p> \n<p>“I wasn’t getting many chances on his serve,” Murray said later. “I started to read it better at the end of the tie-break, and that’s when the match changed.”</p> \n<p>He was happier talking about Jos&eacute; Mourinho, a regular here this week, and who chatted with him afterwards.</p> \n<p>“I haven’t spoken to him long enough,” Murray said, “but I’d like to. When I was doing my rehab at Chelsea, they were in the middle of the season and getting ready for training sessions, so didn’t really have enough time. I’d love to chat to him about what it is that makes him great.”</p> \n<p>If Murray beats Troicki and then the winner of the semi-final between Gilles Simon and Kevin Anderson, a fourth Queen’s title would put him alongside John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Andy Roddick and Lleyton Hewitt in the Open era.</p> \n<p>Anderson took an hour and 25 minutes to beat Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 7-6, 7-5, and has the confidence of having already put Wawrinka out of the tournament, his fourth straight win over the Swiss. The 6ft 8in South African added 18 aces to 44 already struck for the week.</p> \n<p>From the lush fields of Queen’s to the grass of Halle in Germany, the game’s big-serving beasts have been devouring opponents with tigerish intensity ahead of Wimbledon, which starts on Monday week.</p> \n<p>In Halle on Friday, Ivo Karlovic added to the collective blizzard of unhittable serves when he fired a record 45 free-pointers past poor Tomas Berdych in three sets to reach the semi-finals of the Gerry Weber tournament.</p> \n<p>If Roger Federer can stop the 36-year-old Croatian – one of only three players, alongside Federer himself and Stan Wawrinka, to beat Novak Djokovic this year – he will likely sleep well at the end of it. Federer beat Florian Mayer 6-0, 7-6, and was one of the few members of the game’s elite to escape a proper mauling. Karlovic’s fusillade in winning 7-5, 6-7, 6-3 against the tournament’s third seed brought his tally of aces for the week to 94.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/19/1434747698566/Andy-Murray-will-face-Vik-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray will face Viktor Troicki in the semi-finals at Queen's after a battling last-eight test against Gilles Müller.

Following thrilling wins at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/england-new-zealand-first-odi-match-report\" title=\"\">Edgbaston</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/17/england-morgan-root-new-zealand-centuries\" title=\"\">Trent Bridge</a> – and notable showings in defeat at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/new-zealand-england-one-day-international\" title=\"\">Southampton</a> and T<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/12/eoin-morgan-england-new-zealand-run-chase-calculation\" title=\"\">he Oval</a> – the result here should allegedly not be considered the be-all and end-all.</p> \n<p>That philosophical outlook is hard to take issue with, especially when delivered by the sparky fast bowler Mark Wood who, alongside his Durham team-mate Ben Stokes, addressed the assembled media with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2014/jul/22/the-joy-of-six-sports-ghost-stories\" title=\"\">the reputedly haunted Lumley Castle</a> as a backdrop, offering the latest opinions as to why Eoin Morgan’s side have well and truly laid the ghost of their horror World Cup to rest. Not that a local marketing drive was required – the game is a sell-out.</p> \n<p>Win, lose or tie – the last perhaps most fitting for these two well-matched sides – Wood believes this series can be viewed only positively from an England perspective, representing progress against, if not always with, the white ball. Brendon McCullum’s hell-for-leather tourists have played their part, too, and now only 287 runs are required for this to pass India’s and Pakistan’s efforts in 2004 and become the heaviest-scoring five-match rubber in history.</p> \n<p>Following their epic chase of 350 at Trent Bridge on Wednesday – a win that drew the series level at two apiece and further underlined the elan with which England now play – Wood was happy, in his own way, to talk up their chances of securing a first bilateral series victory in 15 months at the ground where he learned his trade.</p> \n<p>“Does the win at Trent Bridge give us an edge? Let’s be controversial and say yes it does,” joked Wood, who claimed his home town of Ashington will be coming to watch the game. “We’ll chase down anything, eh? The manner of the victory was obviously pleasing, to win with six overs left, but we know how dangerous New Zealand are and they’ll come back fighting hard. It’s been a topsy-turvy series in terms of who’s come out with the end result but both teams have played some really good cricket.”</p> \n<p>England’s preparations have been dented somewhat by a blow to the left hand <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/jos-buttler-injures-hand-england-practice-cricket-one-day-international-new-zealand\" title=\"\">of the wicketkeeper-batsman Jos Buttler in training</a>, splitting the webbing between thumb and forefinger. Buttler could play with a pain-numbing injection in the morning but it is far from an ideal option given the feel a gloveman requires in taking the ball and the proximity of the looming Ashes series – something Wood admits is hard not to think about, even before a first international on his home ground.</p> \n<p>While the medical staff are confident no further damage would be risked by Buttler playing, Yorkshire’s Jonny Bairstow was called into the squad on Friday and looks the sensible option – not least because of his own form with the bat this season that has him averaging 80 in the County Championship. Sam Billings, a specialist batsman at No7 this series, is the alternative given his status as Kent’s first choice behind the stumps but Bairstow, it is reported, is next in line.</p> \n<p>That issue aside, England have no reason to change tack from Nottingham – a game in which Buttler’s scoring talents were not required as they chased down their target with three wickets down – and the Chester-le-Street pitch looks another belter for batsmen. For New Zealand’s Ross Taylor, who was Durham’s overseas player five years ago, there is hope for the leather hurlers, however.</p> \n<p>“The ball tends to swing around a bit here and it is a day match,” Taylor noted. “If you look back on Southampton that was also a day match and it has been the only game where the ball has swung – and swung consistently. You need to assess the conditions and a score between 280 and 320 could be a winning one here.”</p> \n<p>That such numbers now represent a low-scoring one-day match is something in itself. The last time the two countries played out a decider for a five-match series was in Dunedin in 2002, where the home side triumphed by chasing down England’s 218 for eight with seven balls to spare thanks to an unbeaten 122 from Nathan Astle. Nasser Hussain, captain that day, scored 50 from 80 balls from No3 while Nick Knight’s 24 from 25 balls was considered racy and not a single six was struck by the tourists.</p> \n<p>Fast-forward 13 years and the boundary rope has been cleared 69 times in these four games to date, with only another seven maximums required for what would be another record in a five-match series. With a match still to play, this series has already yielded 338 boundaries, more than any previous five-game series. It is little wonder therefore that bowlers, who would once snap hands off for 10 overs, one for 40, are now rethinking what merits a decent set of figures.</p> \n<p>“If you can go at under six an over then you’ve done pretty well,” said Wood. “Even eight an over is OK, especially in the power-plays. David Willey was disappointed to go at eight an over at Trent Bridge but I just said to him: ‘Look, you’ve bowled up front when the field is in and you’ve bowled at the end when they’re trying to hit it.’ If you go at eight as a bowler in those times, then you’re actually doing all right in this one-day series. We have to try to take wickets. If you take wickets, that’s the best way to stop the scoring.</p> \n<p>“It’s like a long version of the Twenty20 now. The batters come hard straight away and there’s no looking to just knock it around. If the batsmen think they can take you down, they’re going to try to do that. My role as the attacking option is to fight fire with fire. If they’re going to come hard, I’m going to come hard as well as try to get them out. I quite enjoy that role.</p> \n<p>Is it fair? “As a bowler, probably not,” he said. “But the crowds are here for entertainment and they want to see fours and sixes and hear the loud music. It’s a challenge for us as bowlers but we have to be up for that.”</p> \n<h2>England v New Zealand, Emirates Durham, 10.30am Saturday 20 June, probable teams</h2> \n<p><strong>England</strong> Alex Hales, Jason Roy, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (capt), Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow (wk), Sam Billings, Adil Rashid, David Willey, Mark Wood, Steven Finn</p> \n<p><strong>New Zealand</strong> Brendon McCullum (capt), Martin Guptill, Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor, Grant Elliott, Mitchell Santner, Luke Ronchi (wk), Nathan McCullum, Tim Southee, Matt Henry, Mitchell McClenaghan</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434735051388/England-Durham-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England warm up during a nets session before the series decider against New Zealand at the Emirates Durham.

The initial plan was to remove the upper tiers of the stadium and scale it back to a modest 25,000-seat bowl after the Games.</p> \n<p>But the coalition government and Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, urged a rethink in 2010, reasoning that it was folly to in effect knock it down and that only football could provide a sustainable future. Following a bitter battle with Tottenham Hotspur, a deal was eventually agreed with West Ham that later collapsed under legal challenge.</p> \n<p>Following another tender process, the club were awarded a 99-year lease to share the stadium with other tenants including UK Athletics. The operator of the Stade de France was recently appointed to handle the running of the stadium and to book concerts and sporting events to supplement income.</p> \n<p>Last year the LLDC admitted that the cost had risen to &pound;193.9m as a result of difficulties that Balfour Beatty was experiencing with the world’s largest cantilevered roof.</p> \n<p>The LLDC said that the deals it had signed with West Ham, who will in effect be the main tenants during the football season, and British Athletics, which is entitled to use for the whole of July, would ensure that it would not require continuing subsidy from the taxpayer.</p> \n<p>“We have invested in transforming a temporary athletics venue into a permanent world-class multiuse arena that has a secure and long-term sustainable future,” said the LLDC’s chief executive, David Goldstone. “This has required a significant amount of work and innovative engineering solutions.</p> \n<p>“Alongside the transformation work the deals signed with British Athletics and West Ham United and the appointment of a stadium operator ensures the stadium will pay its way and not require any continuing subsidy from the taxpayer.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/apr/21/west-ham-olympic-stadium-timeline-tottenham-hotspur-leyton-orient-owen-gibson\">West Ham’s long and winding road to the Olympic Stadium</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The largest chunk of funding for the transformation comes from a one-off settlement of &pound;148.8m from the exchequer in 2010.

And London has the power to make that happen.”</p> \n<p>Blair’s pledge was followed up by other members of the team pushing London’s Olympic bid. Tessa Jowell spoke of “the chance to turn the rhetoric of legacy into fact” and of “faster progress towards a healthier nation”.</p> \n<p>“We hope to see people becoming increasingly active,” she continued, “with a goal of seeing two million people more active by 2012 through focused investment in our sporting infrastructure and better support and information for people wanting to be active. We will transform the lives of young people through sport.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/15/britain-olympic-legacy-london-2012\">Britain’s Olympic legacy is a sedentary nation | David Conn</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Labour government, she said, had broadly met its target that all school pupils should be offered a minimum of two hours a week of sport. Now the ambition was for all pupils between five and 16 to be offered five hours of sport a week by 2012. “All of this will be made possible,” she explained, “by inspirational teachers and coaches, alongside modern facilities.”</p> \n<p>Sebastian Coe told the delegates how grateful he was to the Olympics for lighting the flame of his own sporting ambition. “That gratitude drives me and my team to do whatever we can to inspire young people to choose sport,” he said.</p> \n<p>Their words did the trick, along with a film presenting Britain as a country moving towards a bright future for new generations of multicultural citizens who would be given every opportunity to exploit the inspiration provided by the Games.

Only a minority would deny that the regeneration of a neglected area of east London was a worthwhile project in general terms, while millions enjoyed the spectacle of the events inside and outside the stadiums. And no one who participated as an Olympic volunteer will tell you that the experience was anything other than unforgettably life-enhancing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/19/olympic-stadium-cost-rises-west-ham\">Olympic Stadium cost rises to &pound;701m after initial &pound;280m estimate</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>A couple of this week’s headlines, however, cast a shadow over those golden memories of two summers ago. The first came on Monday, when Sport England’s half-yearly survey <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/11/olympic-legacy-sport-participation-plummets\" title=\"\">revealed a fall of 220,000</a> in the number of people of all ages taking part in sport of any kind for at least half an hour a week, compared with the previous six months. Another statistic was equally remarkable: over the past decade, the number of people swimming regularly – an activity with particularly close ties to physical fitness – has dropped by almost three-quarters of a million.</p> \n<p>Then on Friday came a survey from a group of researchers at Essex University indicating <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jun/18/england-pupils-the-least-fit-they-have-ever-been\" title=\"\">a dramatic worsening in the fitness of Britain’s schoolchildren</a>. Don’t blame obesity caused by massive amounts of sugar-saturated food and drink. Children with perfectly normal levels of body fat are now showing themselves to be less fit than those of earlier generations, and the blame is placed on a sedentary lifestyle – in other words, a lack of exercise.</p> \n<p>The findings underline those published earlier in the week in a report presented by the chair of ukactive, Tanni Grey-Thompson. The former Paralympic champion said that promoting sport in schools is not the only solution. Simple physical fitness is something that should be tested as regularly as a knowledge of maths. But it would be hard not to connect this week’s findings with the memory of Michael Gove’s announcement in November 2010, barely six months into the life of the coalition government, that his education department planned to dismantle the 450 school sports partnerships that had forged links between primary and secondary schools, encouraging the sharing of facilities and funding specialist coaches.</p> \n<p>The angry reaction to Gove’s announcement – with its suggestion that a nationwide Schools Olympics costing &pound;10m could provide an adequate replacement – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2010/dec/20/u-turn-michael-gove-school-sport-partnership\" title=\"\">eventually forced a bit of a climbdown</a>, enough to save face but not enough to leave a notably successful structure undamaged. It was one of the decisions that rendered the education secretary so unacceptable to the public that he had to be removed from the job and then tucked completely out of sight well before this year’s general election.</p> \n<p>Sport England’s survey revealed that the decline in sports participation shows itself in the poorer sections of the population. Among the better-off – such as all those men and women riding expensive carbon-fibre bikes around the lanes of Surrey every weekend – it is actually increasing. Any attempt, such as the one Gove made five years ago, to limit the access of state-school pupils to sport or even non-competitive exercise is a form of social engineering that speaks volumes about the failure of those who grew up amid the lavish facilities of public schools to accept a duty of care.</p> \n<p>The new sports minister, educated at a selective girls’ grammar school in Kent, gives a more convincing impression of an interest in the job than some of her predecessors. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/04/sports-minister-tracey-crouch-premier-league\" title=\"\">Tracey Crouch</a> is a qualified FA coach and manages a girls’ under-13 team. It is her job to minimise the damage done by George Osborne’s &pound;12bn of cuts to the facilities offered to those who need them most, and good luck to her.</p> \n<p>It all seems so obvious. Depriving children of the encouragement to take regular exercise will produce generations of unhealthy adults primed to make extra demands on whatever is left of the National Health Service. And relying on public schools to turn out national sporting heroes simply accentuates society’s growing division.</p> \n<p>Mark Kenny, a retired games master who does voluntary coaching with primary school children in south London, was one of many who got in touch five years ago to express his anger at the proposed demolition of the SSPs. This week, when I asked him for an update, he had a new suggestion: how about removing the charitable status of private education and using the money to fund sport and other health-related physical activities in state primaries? “We are not all in this together,” he says. After comparing this week’s stories with the promises made 10 years ago, that is the only available conclusion.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/19/1434718121124/London-2012-Olympic-Venue-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Olympics transformed a run-down corner of east London but it has failed to inspire an increase in sporting activity across a divided country.
