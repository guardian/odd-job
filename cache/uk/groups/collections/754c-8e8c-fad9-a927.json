The label is now serious; Jordan Spieth has become only the sixth player in golfing history to claim the Masters and US Open back-to-back. The last man to achieve such a feat? Tiger Woods, once the most golden of them all. Spieth hasn’t so much dealt with expectations as vaulted over them. </p> \n<p>Further glances at history endorse the scale of Spieth’s achievement on a sun-kissed afternoon in the Pacific Northwest. At just 21, he is the youngest player since Gene Sarazen in 1922 to place multiple major success beside his name. </p> \n<p>Suddenly, Spieth is halfway towards a career grand slam. “You can’t win them all if you don’t win the first two,” he said during his victory address. “So we are going to go St Andrews looking for the Claret Jug. I believe we can get it done.” Arrogance? Not a bit of it. The confidence is perfectly justified. </p> \n<p>Chambers Bay was a controversial major venue but it produced a stunning champion; a young man who is showing little regard whatsoever for ceremony when continually swatting aside all before him. Spieth’s unwillingness to simply compete, his ability to prevail in completely different scenarios, set him apart from those with considerably more experience. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-final-round-live\">US Open 2015: final round –as it happened | Scott Murray</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As the Texan celebrated his latest triumph, it was impossible not to feel sympathy for Dustin Johnson. The 30-year-old continues to find new ways to pass up major championship opportunities; from bizarre rules breaches to complete blow-ups to, on this occasion, three-putting the 72nd hole. </p> \n<p>In what proved a quite incredible US Open denouement, Johnson had a 12ft eagle putt to win the championship. As that effort slid 4ft past, there was a sad sense of inevitability. Already in the locker room at five under par, Spieth was soon to be crowned the champion. He didn’t even need a Monday 18-hole play-off to seal his title.</p> \n<p>There was a time when Michael Greller caddied for amateurs at Chambers Bay. His aim back then was to somehow make it to a US Open. Not only has Greller done that, he has carried the bag of a champion. It isn’t only Spieth who is rapidly turning dreams into reality. </p> \n<p>On a quite epic day, Spieth believed his chance may have gone. Leading by three with two to play, he double-bogeyed the par three 17<sup>th</sup> after a horrible tee shot. This opened the door for Johnson, who birdied the penultimate hole and played a glorious five-iron into the last from 247 yards. Disaster was to strike thereafter, as it has so many times in Johnson’s enigmatic career. This stumble will wound him more than any other. </p> \n<p>“On the last green, I was thinking, ‘This is why I’m here. This is why I play the game of golf.’ It just didn’t work out,” said an understandably shellshocked Johnson. </p> \n<p>Different players had flirted with glory. Branden Grace was tied with Spieth before carving his tee shot on 16 out of bounds. Louis Oosthuizen played the Sunday back nine in just 29 shots for a four under total. Oosthuizen, denied a playoff by one, will look back ruefully on an opening round of 77. There was little shock attached to the fact that Jason Day, who had earlier suffered from the effects of vertigo, watched his challenge peter out. Day signed for a 74 and tied for ninth place. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/rory-mcilroy-charge-us-open-2015\">Rory McIlroy charges up US Open leaderboard but leaves it too late</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Day’s compatriot, Adam Scott, showed the benefits of having Steve Williams back on caddie duties. Scott signed off with a 64 for a share of fourth with Grace and the 21-year-old Australian Cameron Smith. </p> \n<p>As this nail-biting conclusion was being played out, Ian Poulter took to social media to offer a lengthy criticism of Chambers Bay. The Englishman had promised to keep his counsel over the venue until the conclusion of his fourth round and kept to that vow.</p> \n<p>Poulter admitted he “didn’t play well enough to be remotely close” but added: “It is disgraceful that the USGA hasn’t apologised about the greens they simply have said ‘we are thrilled the course condition this week.’ </p> \n<p>“It wasn’t a bad golf course, in fact it played well and was playable. What wasn’t playable were the green surfaces. If this was a regular PGA Tour event lots of players would have withdrawn and gone home on Wednesday but players won’t do that for a major. They were simply the worst most disgraceful surfaces I have ever seen on any tour in all the years I have played.</p> \n<p>“The US Open deserves better than that.”</p> \n<p>Whether merited or not, the tournament threw up an unforgettable closing chapter. If Rory McIlroy is the finest golfer in the world, there can be no doubt over the man to capture hearts and minds thus far in 2015. Scarily, this is still only the beginning of Spieth’s career. </p> \n<p><br /> </p> \n<p><br /> </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434942293745/ed03bc58-5176-49c9-99d3-31458fe7806a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kyle Terada/USA Today Sports","altText":"Jordan Spieth","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Kyle Terada/USA Today Sports"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T03:01:24Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T03:57:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":41,"contributors":[{"name":"Ewan Murray","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/26/1401131130466/Ewan-Murray-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ewanmurray"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["US Open Golf 2015","Jordan Spieth","US Open","Golf","PGA Tour","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/us-open-golf-2015","webTitle":"US Open Golf 2015"},{"id":"sport/jordan-spieth","webTitle":"Jordan Spieth"},{"id":"sport/usopengolf","webTitle":"US Open"},{"id":"sport/golf","webTitle":"Golf"},{"id":"sport/pga-tour","webTitle":"PGA Tour"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ewan Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ewanmurray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-jordan-spieth-wins-in-thrilling-finish-to-add-to-masters-crown","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a278","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-jordan-spieth-wins-in-thrilling-finish-to-add-to-masters-crown","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/21/us-open-2015-jordan-spieth-wins-in-thrilling-finish-to-add-to-masters-crown"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434942293745/ed03bc58-5176-49c9-99d3-31458fe7806a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jordan Spieth kisses the US Open trophy after a remarkable finish to the tournament.

Here McIlroy embarked on a turbo-charged run which saw him reach the turn in 32 before holing birdies at the 10th – where he played one of the shots of the tournament from a fairway bunker to within 3ft of the hole – 12th and 13th. The third of those arrived via a 72ft putt from over the back of the putting surface.</p> \n<p>Roars reverberated around the venue. McIlroy had confirmed an ability to produce these cataclysmic surges which no other player in this sport can replicate. From the 14th green Marc Warren, in the group in front of McIlroy and John Senden, stood back just to watch the four-time major winner’s drive. Even fellow professionals knew what was taking place.</p> \n<p>Perhaps McIlroy was not even the one smiling most widely. The USGA and its executive director, Mike Davis, finally had a counter-argument against the wave of criticism this event has withstood. A finale featuring McIlroy in such imperious form, after all, is hardly the domain of a two-bit event. Some of the sniping towards Chambers Bay has been perfectly valid. The 115th US Open, though, reached its conclusion in nail-biting circumstances and with the game’s most prominent figures as the leading players.</p> \n<p>The Northern Irishman’s wings were clipped with a bogey on the par-three 15th. The putting woe which had undermined his attempt to run away with this competition, never mind win it, returned. He failed to recover on the short 16th, missed a tiny putt for par on the penultimate hole and ultimately signed for 66 and an even-par 72-hole total.</p> \n<p>This represented a magnificent, if belated, effort. The sense that the Open Championship, at the Old Course he so adores, cannot come quickly enough for McIlroy is unavoidable.</p> \n<p>Earlier Chris Kirk had offered the most fierce critique of the USGA. The American, who opened his fourth round with a 10, was in no better mood by the time he took to the locker room. Kirk claimed the USGA should be “ashamed of what they did” to this tournament.</p> \n<p>Billy Horschel stopped only narrowly short of implanting his putter into a green by way of exhibiting his frustration. The FedEx Cup holder shot 67 on Sunday but was still scathing in his assessment of four days in the Pacific north-west.</p> \n<p>“I think a lot of players, and I’m one of them, have lost some respect for the USGA and this championship this year for the greens,” said Horschel.</p> \n<p>“It sounds like the players are whining and complaining. Well, you’re playing for millions of dollars, you’re playing for the US Open championship. We’re not looking for perfect greens. We’re not looking for Memorial’s greens or even last week at TPC Southwind in Memphis, at the FedEx St Jude Classic. But we’re looking for something that’s very consistent. Every green is very consistent. And this week they’re not.”</p> \n<p>Sergio Garc&iacute;a signed off with a 68 for three over in total. Justin Rose’s 71 was for plus five. Phil Mickelson had gone 71 holes without a double bogey before taking a fresh air swipe in rough at the last, causing precisely that. He kept his post-round comments to 49 words after a 73.</p> \n<p>Lee Westwood was more expansive. The Englishman closed on nine over after an even-par 70. “It’s the kind of course I would like to come and play with my mates, with a cart and a few beers,” he said. “There are certain aspects to it that I don’t think are right for a US Open but I am thinking more from a fan’s point of view. It’s been a strange atmosphere out there because they can’t seem to get close to the action on some holes. I watched Phil Mickelson tee off on the 1st today and they are not going to see him again until his second shot on the 2nd hole.</p> \n<p>“From a fan’s point of view it would have been an even harder walk than the players. It’s actually quite dangerous for them. I would be interested to see how active the First Aid tents have been this week. It’s treacherous out there.</p> \n<p>“The greens being in poor condition is obviously disappointing. It’s the US Open, you want it in pristine condition but sometimes these things are out of your control.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434929835492/US-Open-Championship-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy hits his tee shot on the 11th hole during the fourth round of the US Open at Chambers Bay.

Representatives then travelled to the UK for a meeting at which they requested United set a price for the goalkeeper. Madrid remain convinced they will eventually sign De Gea, who has one year left on his contract and wants to return to Spain, and anticipated a meeting that would be a formality. Instead they met a counter-bid: you want De Gea, we want Ramos.</p> \n<p>The central defender has been at Real Madrid for 10 seasons since joining from Sevilla for €27m when he was still a teenager. He has played more than 400 games for Madrid and is the vice-captain but negotiations over a new contract have been at a standstill for some time.

Real Madrid did not deny that story but the player’s camp did.</p> \n<p>Ramos has two years left on the deal he signed in 2011, meaning Madrid’s hand may not yet be forced – certainly not to the extent that they believe United’s has been forced regarding De Gea.</p> \n<p>It is unusual for Madrid to allow a player’s deal to enter into the final two years, though.

There are a few things I’m doing a little bit better.”</p> \n<p>Murray joins four other four-time Queen’s winners in John McEnroe, Boris Becker, Lleyton Hewitt and Andy Roddick. But, when reminded he went on to win Wimbledon after winning here in 2013, he said there was no direct connection.</p> \n<p>“That means nothing, really. There are no guarantees that winning here gives you a Wimbledon title. I need to go out there and earn it. I need to train well the next five, six days.</p> \n<p>“It’s great preparation, a great start to my preparation on the grass. It gives me that little bit of confidence going in there. But it’s a long way to go before Wimbledon even starts and then all sorts of things can happen during slams.”</p> \n<p>Murray paid tribute to his coach of one year, Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo, augmented lately by the input of Jonas Bjorkman, for the adjustments to his game that have allowed him to play his best tennis in two years, on grass and clay.</p> \n<p>She arrives in London on Monday evening, having left Bjorkman to oversee Murray’s training at Queen’s, and will hand on to him again after Wimbledon, as she is expecting her first child in August.</p> \n<p>“Obviously I’m not going to stay undefeated with him forever,” Murray said of his winning sequence of nine matches and two tournaments. “But I also have to give a lot of credit to Am&eacute;lie. The things I have worked on with her, like using my variety, I have spoken about a lot. Hopefully a culmination of the two of them will give me more success. I have spoken to Am&eacute;lie a couple of times on the phone and we message every day. It’s been a good start.”</p> \n<p>He added: “I won’t train tomorrow, and will probably be at Wimbledon on Tuesday. I’m doing something for Tim Henman’s foundation at Roehampton on Tuesday. The rest of the week I will be at Wimbledon training.”</p> \n<p>It is looking very much like business as usual for a player growing in confidence by the day.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434913507942/Andy-Murray-after-winning-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray celebrates his 6-3, 6-4 victory in his men's singles final against Kevin Anderson at Queen's.

This may have been a staccato performance, one that frustrated far more than it excited, but it means the side have broken a winless streak in these finals that had stretched back to 2009.</p> \n<p>More importantly the semi-finals are back on the agenda. With the opening defeat against Portugal, coupled with the losses of Saido Berahino and John Stones to injury, threatening the equilibrium in the squad, much of Southgate’s preparation for this game had involved limiting the damage to the collective psyche. Perhaps this result can turn the tide.</p> \n<p>“After the game the other night we had to stop the bleeding a little bit,” said Southgate. “We’d had hammer blows with the two injuries to outstanding players, then the manner of the goal we conceded and the defeat. So we had to do a lot of work making sure all of the noise around us didn’t affect us.</p> \n<p>“We’ve made a step in the right direction. It’s in our hands. I think the momentum starts to swing with us a little bit now and that’s very important in football.”</p> \n<p>Portugal’s goalless draw with Italy means the situation in Group B is a complex one. England do not need to beat Italy but failure to do so will leave them reliant on the other result.</p> \n<p>They will have to improve for that fixture. Tactical tinkering and personnel changes for Sweden had been long-planned and the onus was on Will Hughes and Alex Pritchard, coming into the side in place of James Ward-Prowse and Lingard, to provide the attacking impetus that flickered only sporadically against Portugal. Neither would be on the pitch after an hour, with Danny Ings introduced for Hughes at half-time and Pritchard hobbling off to be replaced by the eventual goalscorer.</p> \n<p>Perhaps more than anything the absence of Stones, who had been earmarked as the defensive launchpad for England’s passing game, has been felt most keenly in the two games to date. Concussion protocols allow him to return for the final game – a rather less understandable protocol, this time from Uefa, meant the squad had to travel the 100 yards or so from hotel to Andruv Stadium on the team coach.</p> \n<p>The Everton defender’s likely return against the Italians should add some much-needed drive. But the stodgy performance was not all England’s making – Sweden’s win over Italy in their opening game afforded Hakan Ericson’s side the luxury of conservatism. There was a very different shape to this game from that in the Portugal tie, with England dominating the ball – they enjoyed 62% of possession – and trying to conjure space between their opponents’ two banks of four.</p> \n<p>It was a struggle. Almost half an hour had passed before England truly threatened the Sweden goal. Nathan Redmond fed Carl Jenkinson on the right and his low cross was nodded just wide by a diving Harry Kane. That chance began England’s best period of the first 45 minutes, with Hughes denied brilliantly by Filip Helander’s goal-saving tackle after Pritchard’s clever delayed pull-back and Pritchard himself denied by sheer weight of numbers after a ferreting run into the box.</p> \n<p>Those chances, though, were islands of excitement in an ocean of frustration. Before half-time Jack Butland was only twice called into action, first to gather John Guidetti’s low shot, then to claim Isaac Kiese Thelin’s header, and neither save was taxing.</p> \n<p>Nor was Butland unduly taxed in the second half and, for far longer than would have been comfortable for Southgate, neither was Patrik Carlgren in the Sweden goal. A clear pattern was set – England dominated the ball but again struggled to make the best use of it. It was by no means abject but nor was there much food for thought for the watching Roy Hodgson as he ponders plans for the remainder of the Euro 2016 qualifying campaign. With five minutes go there was that creeping familiar sense that England and tournaments simply do not mix.</p> \n<p>Then Lingard, introduced early in the second half for the injured Pritchard – “It didn’t look very good,” was Southgate’s immediate prognosis and the midfielder left the stadium on crutches – produced a moment of brilliance. Carlgren flapped a Luke Garbutt corner to the edge of the box and the Manchester United midfielder chested it down before sending a fizzing volley back past the Sweden goalkeeper.</p> \n<p>“We had to show a lot of character and resilience because we knew how difficult it would be to break Sweden down,” said Southgate. “We felt we could wear them down the longer the game went on. We had to remain positive right to the end. We dominated possession.</p> \n<p>“I think our tempo at times could have been a bit quicker but maybe that was the burden of young players feeling the need to win the game.”</p> \n<p>That burden will still be there when the side face Italy in the same stadium on Wednesday but at least the dam has been broken.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434909137981/Sweden-0-1-England-Under--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jesse Lingard fires in the 85th-minute winner for England against Sweden in the European Under-21 Championship in Olomouc.

I think I have found what I needed to find last year in terms of in the races and that’s what is really working out for me this year.”</p> \n<p>A rather subdued Hamilton said: “I had a problem with the revs. I took my foot off the gas and the throttle was still on. It was not the best way to start the race but it is something we will work on to improve on my side of the garage.” Or Rosberg may just have caught him napping.</p> \n<p>Before the pair came in for their solitary pit stop there was a five-lap period when Rosberg increased his lead from two seconds to four. Hamilton managed to reduce his disadvantage to 2.2sec but then, when the drivers pitted, Rosberg emerged the stronger once again. His stop was marginally the quicker (2.7 against 3.1) and the German built up his lead over the subsequent laps. When it emerged that Hamilton had crossed the white line at the pit exit, incurring a five-second penalty, Rosberg had in effect doubled his lead, from about five seconds to 10. But Rosberg would have won anyway. His only worry after that was some tyre vibrations in the closing stages.</p> \n<p>The Mercedes motorsport chief, Toto Wolff, believes Rosberg exhibited the mental toughness in victory that will keep the championship race alive to the end. Asked how Rosberg manages to keep in touch with Hamilton, Wolff said: “I’ve been asked this before: ‘Is this the tipping point? Is he now going to be No2 [driver]?’ I kept repeating that he’s mentally very strong, and we’ve seen that today.</p> \n<p>“Both of them are under pressure because they’re pushing each other so much. Nico was faultless. We saw from today it’s going to go down to the wire. The races we have seen have been characterised by tiny mistakes by both of them, or the team, and today we have seen great race pace and faultless execution by Nico. It was a great performance.”</p> \n<p>Felipe Massa (Williams) and Sebastian Vettel (Ferrari) were next, followed by Valtteri Bottas (Williams) and Nico H&uuml;lkenberg (Force India).</p> \n<p>The race got off to a dramatic start when there was a heavy collision between Fernando Alonso and Kimi Raikkonen – drivers usually extremely adept at keeping out of trouble. It is no small irony that earlier in the weekend Raikkonen had said that F1 should become “a little more dangerous”.</p> \n<p>The Finn lost his rear end and Alonso, with nowhere to go, clattered into the back of him, putting both out of the race. They were also lucky to escape injury. It was an even more wretched weekend than usual for McLaren, with both of their cars out of the race by lap nine. Jenson Button, who like Alonso had been handed a 25-place grid penalty, was told to retire, and said: “When you have a 10sec stop-go penalty retiring on lap nine is never a bad thing. I chose to have the penalties this weekend rather than Silverstone. Hopefully we will have a clean weekend there.”</p> \n<p>McLaren said: “A brief and very disappointing Austrian GP for the team. Time to get our heads down for testing and Silverstone.” But to add to their long list of troubles this season the damage to Alonso’s car – which had the upgrades ahead of Button’s for the race – is likely to compromise the final in-season testing session this week.</p> \n<h2>Final positions after race (71 laps) </h2> \n<p><strong>1 Nico Rosberg</strong> (Ger) Mercedes 1hr 30min 16.930sec, <strong>2 Lewis Hamilton </strong>(GB) Mercedes 1:30:25.730, <strong>3 Felipe Massa </strong>(Br) Williams 1:30:34.503, <strong>4 Sebastian Vettel </strong>(Ger) Ferrari 1:30:35.111, <strong>5 Valtteri Bottas </strong>(Fin) Williams 1:31:10.534, <strong>6 Nico H&uuml;lkenberg </strong>(Ger) Force India 1:31:21.005, <strong>7 Pastor Maldonado </strong>(Ven) Lotus at 1 Lap, <strong>8 Max Verstappen</strong> (Neth) Toro Rosso at 1 Lap, <strong>9 Sergio P&eacute;rez</strong> (Mex) Force India at 1 Lap, <strong>10 Daniel Ricciardo </strong>(Aus) Red Bull at 1 Lap, <strong>11 Felipe Nasr </strong>(Br) Sauber at 1 Lap, <strong>12 Daniil Kvyat </strong>(Rus) Red Bull at 1 Lap, <strong>13 Marcus Ericsson </strong>(Swe) Sauber at 2 Laps, <strong>14 Roberto Merhi </strong>(Sp) Manor at 3 Laps</p> \n<p>Not Classified: <strong>15 Romain Grosjean </strong>(Fr) Lotus 37 Laps completed, <strong>16 Carlos Sainz </strong>(Sp) Toro Rosso 36 Laps completed, <strong>17 Jenson Button </strong>(GB) McLaren 8 Laps completed, <strong>18 Will Stevens </strong>(GB) Manor Marussia 1 Lap completed, <strong>19 Kimi Raikkonen </strong>(Fin) Ferrari 0 Laps completed, <strong>20 Fernando Alonso </strong>(Sp) McLaren 0 Laps completed</p> \n<h2>Drivers’ championship standings</h2> \n<p><strong>1 Lewis Hamilton</strong> (GB) Mercedes 169pts, <strong>2 Nico Rosberg</strong> (Ger) Mercedes 159, <strong>3 Sebastian Vettel </strong>(Ger) Ferrari 120, <strong>4 Kimi Raikkonen</strong> (Fin) Ferrari 72, <strong>5 Valtteri Bottas </strong>(Fin) Williams 67, <strong>6 Felipe Massa </strong>(Br)Williams 62, <strong>7 Daniel Ricciardo </strong>(Aus) Red Bull 36, <strong>8 Daniil Kvyat</strong> (Rus) Red Bull 19, <strong>9 Nico H&uuml;lkenberg </strong>(Ger) Force India 18, <strong>10 Romain Grosjean</strong> (Fr) Lotus 17, <strong>11 Felipe Nasr </strong>(Br) Sauber 16, <strong>12 Sergio P&eacute;rez (Mex) </strong>Force India 13, <strong>13 Pastor Maldonado </strong>(Ven) Lotus 12, <strong>14 Max Verstappen </strong>(Neth) Toro Rosso 10, <strong>15 Carlos Sainz </strong>(Sp) Toro Rosso 9, <strong>16 Marcus Ericsson </strong>(Swe) Sauber 5, <strong>17 Jenson Button </strong>(GB) McLaren 4, <strong>18 Fernando Alonso </strong>(Sp) McLaren 0, <strong>19 Roberto Merhi (Sp) </strong>Manor Marussia 0, <strong>20 Will Stevens </strong>(GB) Manor Marussia 0, <strong>21 Kevin Magnussen </strong>(Den) McLaren 0</p> \n<h2>Manufacturers’ championship standings</h2> \n<p><strong>1 Mercedes</strong> 328pts,<strong> 2 Ferrari</strong> 192, <strong>3 Williams</strong> 129, <strong>4 Red Bull</strong> 55, <strong>5 Force India</strong> 31, <strong>6 Lotus</strong> 29, <strong>7 Sauber</strong> 21, <strong>8 Toro Rosso</strong> 19, <strong>9 McLaren </strong>4, <strong>10 Manor</strong> 0</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434893550070/F1-Grand-Prix-of-Austria-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nico Rosberg, No6, beats Lewis Hamilton into the first corner of the F1 Austrian Grand Prix, with Sebastian Vettel in third.

Kyah Simon’s 80th-minute goal was enough for Australia to cause the tournament’s biggest shock on Sunday in Moncton.<br /> </p> \n<p>After an afternoon labouring in cold and damp conditions, two substitutes began and finished the decisive goal. Katrina Gorry’s fine pass released captain Lisa De Vanna on the right, whose shot was fumbled by Brazilian keeper Luciana into the path of Simon. Running with intent to the back post, Simon sidefooted the ball into the open net to give Australia their first tournament win over Brazil.<br /> </p> \n<p>The win returns the Matildas to the last eight of the World Cup for the third straight time, but is the first knockout win for any Australian senior team after the expansion of the Women’s World Cup this year.<br /> </p> \n<p>Australia will return to Edmonton for a quarter-final, which could be a rematch of the past two Asian Cup finals. Japan face the Netherlands for the right to play Australia, as the Matildas bid to reach the semi-finals for the first time.<br /> </p> \n<p>A tactical first half in Moncton was devoid of clear chances. Sam Kerr’s sweet volley from Emily van Egmond’s corner on 10 minutes rippled the side-netting.<br /> </p> \n<p>Full-backs Caitlin Foord and Steph Catley were lively attacking options, although the Matildas had their fair share of ragged moments. With the half-hour mark looming, Formiga dispossessed Van Egmond, and forced Matildas goalkeeper Lydia Williams to make a superb save from her swirling long-range strike.<br /> </p> \n<p>After the half-time break, the rain came down and the match opened up. The Matildas had a major scare on 63 minutes when the unmarked Formiga headed into the post with the rain teeming down. De Vanna scurried the ball down the other end, teeing up van Egmond, who shot wide.<br /> </p> \n<p>Brazil’s long-range strikes looked increasingly likely to beat Williams but the keeper held strong. By 72 minutes, both Gorry and Simon were on the field and, less than 10 minutes later, they made their impact.<br /> </p> \n<p>After holding out a largely flat Brazilian attack, the Matildas had their slice of history and celebrated wildly on the final whistle.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434913733136/562c9234-94bb-4951-81b9-b3d52b9477c2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Elsa/Getty Images","altText":"Sam Kerr","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Elsa/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T19:14:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-21T22:32:48Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":166,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women's World Cup 2015","Matildas","Football","Sport","Women's football","Australia sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/matildas","webTitle":"Matildas"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"sport/australia-sport","webTitle":"Australia sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/australia-stun-brazil-at-womens-world-cup-to-make-quarter-finals","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a25x","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/21/australia-stun-brazil-at-womens-world-cup-to-make-quarter-finals","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/21/australia-stun-brazil-at-womens-world-cup-to-make-quarter-finals"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerEmbed":"<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b2HeFiVsdk\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9b2HeFiVsdk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Highlights of the clash between Australia and Brazil.

Last week the former Australia pace bowler Jason Gillespie, an Ashes winner himself and now coach of Yorkshire, labelled the visitors’ squad a “dad’s army”, containing as it does two 37-year-olds in Brad Haddin and Chris Rogers, a 35-year-old bowler in Ryan Harris, and Clarke himself, who is 34 and has <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/dec/13/australia-captain-michael-clarke-leaves-field-with-suspected-hamstring-injury\" title=\"\">a long history of back trouble</a>.</p> \n<p>But at his first press conference of the tour, following team training at Merchant Taylors’ school near Watford, Clarke hit back at his former international colleague who at one time had been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/22/jason-gillespie-ecb-england-dream-coach\" title=\"\">tipped to become head coach of England</a>, a job that has gone instead to the captain’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/trevor-bayliss-england-cricket-head-coach\" title=\"\">former coach at New South Wales, Trevor Bayliss</a>. “Jason’s entitled to his opinion,” Clarke said. “Join the queue. I’ve copped criticism my whole career. There’s a long list of people who’ve criticised this team. We might just add ‘Dizzy’ to that list of people we continue to prove wrong.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/australia-steve-smith-ashes-england-no1-test-batsman\">Australia’s Steve Smith stands on top of the world as the Ashes approach</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Clarke also played down the idea that the appointment of Bayliss, whom he knows well, gives England an extra advantage in the forthcoming series which starts in Cardiff on 8 July. “I don’t think so,” he said. “Not these days. Maybe when I first started my career, but not now with all the information and technology you can get on every player. If you’re smart you know every player’s strengths and weaknesses that you play against. And if you’re smart you know your own as well.</p> \n<p>“I think Trevor is a lovely guy and I wish him all the best. I think he’ll be great for England and for any team he coaches. He’s coached me a long time for New South Wales. I think he’ll bring the best out of the England players. It doesn’t matter [to us] that he is an Australian coach. You see so many players playing with and against each other with the different formats around the world these days, and the same with coaches.</p> \n<p>“Trevor coached Sri Lanka for a few years and had success there. He came back to New South Wales and now he has an opportunity with England, so I think it is great for the game and it shows a lot of respect for him that England have opened their arms and welcomed him in. He deserves that because his results certainly show how good a coach he is.”</p> \n<p>Paul Farbrace, the interim England head coach, meanwhile, sees no reason why Eoin Morgan cannot make a return to Test cricket after rediscovering his best form in the thrilling one-day series win against New Zealand.</p> \n<p>Morgan, who has been a limited-overs specialist since winning the last of his 16 Test caps in 2012, endured a poor World Cup as a captain and batsman, but led with distinction in the 3-2 victory over Brendon McCullum’s tourists.</p> \n<p>Asked whether the 28-year-old could be considered for a recall in whites following Saturday’s three-wicket win that sealed the series, Farbrace replied: “Absolutely. It’s a way of getting into the Test side by playing international cricket.</p> \n<p>“The reason we’ve played Ben Stokes in this one-day side is because the more he plays international cricket, the better for him – and that applies to everybody. They should all want to play Test cricket, and if they keep putting in performances they’ll be getting very close to it. There’s absolutely no reason why Morgan can’t play Test cricket.”</p> \n<p>New Zealand’s tour-ending Twenty20 international at Old Trafford on Tuesday will be Farbrace’s final match in charge before he returns to the role of assistant under the incoming Bayliss. The team’s first interaction with their Australian head coach will come on a four-day camp in Spain, starting on Saturday, in readiness for their final preparations for Cardiff from 8 July.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/21/1434892588451/Michael-Clarke--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Michael Clarke cut a relaxed figure in his first press conference before the Ashes in England and said Jason Gillepsie would join a long list of people who had criticised Australia.
