That, however, is not part of the make-up of this Premier League. There was no holding back during a game that rose extravagantly to the boil and it was a wonder it finished goalless. There were chances at both ends, particularly during a gripping second-half, many of them of crystal clarity.</p> \n<p>Yet the point apiece served everyone well, especially Sunderland, who could celebrate the retention of their top-flight status ahead of their final fixture at Chelsea on Sunday. The emotions ran wild at full time, with the travelling supporters cavorting in delight and Dick Advocaat breaking down in tears for what he would later say was the first time in his long career.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/20/arsenal-sunderland-premier-league-relegation-battle\">Emotions snowball for Dick Advocaat after Sunderland clinch safety | Amy Lawrence</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Advocaat has achieved the ends of his short-term managerial brief and he said that he and his players had defied the odds and the naysayers. When he took over in mid-March, the club sat 17th in the table, one point above the drop zone. His record reads impressively – W3 D3 L2 – and there have been calls for him to extend his stay in the north-east by another season before he retires. Advocaat has said that this will be his last managerial job. He will decide on his future next week.</p> \n<p>Advocaat and several of his players made the point that Sunderland could not keep on living like this, dicing with their Premier League status so routinely. With the facilities and the talent at the club, they had to be better. But this was an occasion to exhale or, to paraphrase Advocaat, let it all hang out.</p> \n<p>“My emotions came out when my friend [and assistant] Bert van Lingen came over, we have been 25 years together, and he started crying,” Advocaat said. “He said: ‘Let it go,’ so I said: ‘Why not?’ I didn’t need so much encouragement. Nobody expected this. We had nine games when we took over, and five away from home, including Arsenal and Chelsea. But we did it, with everybody together. To do it here, on our own, against a great team, gives me a special feeling.”</p> \n<p>For Arsenal, the point has all but ensured a top-three finish – only a radical last-day swing of seven goals would usher Manchester United back into contention – and, for only the third time in 10 seasons, they will avoid a Champions League play-off. Ars&egrave;ne Wenger stands to be able to sell this season as a success, particularly if his team go on to beat Aston Villa on Saturday week to retain the FA Cup.</p> \n<p>Wenger, though, lamented a lack of sharpness from his players, a legacy, he said, of the exertions from Sunday’s 1-1 draw at United – a result that has come to look more important. Arsenal have failed to score in their last three home games. “We didn’t look like scoring, honestly,” Wenger said. “Even if we had 28 shots on goal. There was always something missing.” There are worries, Wenger admitted, ahead of the Cup final.</p> \n<p>Advocaat was indebted to Costel Pantilimon, the goalkeeper, who made a string of fine saves but he could also point to the four clear chances that his team created and passed up in the second half. Steven Fletcher, on for the ineffective Danny Graham at half-time, spurned three of them, although his general play was worthy of praise.</p> \n<p>From Adam Johnson’s pass, Fletcher was confronted by David Ospina only for the goalkeeper to block. On the hour, following a quick and direct break, the striker was again one-on-one with Ospina but fluffed the dinked finish. Fletcher will also wonder how he did not convert from close range after Patrick van Aanholt had flashed a shot across goal, while the Dutch full-back had earlier shot tamely at Ospina from Jermain Defoe’s pass.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e9f6ad99b9d9fb1303fc70608bc63a6df8066a74\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432161548281/ff2902f8-6fa0-49a9-922d-b39b0dfa242b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunderland\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Costel Pantilimon and John O’Shea embrace to celebrate Sunderland’s survival.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Arsenal called the tune in the first half, pushing Sunderland back with trademark interchanges. The visitors struggled to escape their half. Jack Wilshere, who made his first start since 22 November, was thwarted at close quarters by Pantilimon and blazed another chance over from Aaron Ramsey’s ball.</p> \n<p>Santi Cazorla worked Pantilimon; Mesut &Ouml;zil lashed over from Wilshere’s cute dink and Olivier Giroud scooped wide after a similar tee-up from Wilshere. It was all very pretty but lacking in punch.</p> \n<p>Sunderland measured their success in tackles won, closing down and blocks. John O’Shea and Sebasti&aacute;n Coates were excellent in central defence while Lee Cattermole snapped, snarled and generally irritated &Ouml;zil.</p> \n<p>Sunderland came out as an attacking force after the interval but Arsenal remained threatening. Hector Beller&iacute;n made inroads up the right and from his crosses, Giroud and Kieran Gibbs drew eye-catching saves out of Pantilimon. Alexis S&aacute;nchez had a shot blocked by Coates.</p> \n<p>The visitors drank in a moment of good fortune when Ramsey’s cross hit Billy Jones and cannoned off the post while the Arsenal substitute Theo Walcott went close before forcing the save of the evening from Pantilimon.

I can deny that,” Cook said at Lord’s on Wednesday. “It was a decision taken by Straussy and Tom Harrison. We weren’t consulted.”</p> \n<p>When asked if he backed Strauss, his former opening partner and Test captain, in ending Pietersen’s stated dream of playing for England again, Cook added: “I do agree with the decision, yes. I’ve watched Straussy from the other end and I’ve worked underneath him as a vice-captain – he was a great leader of men.</p> \n<p>“I know he thinks about decisions a hell of a lot and this wasn’t just an off-the-cuff decision. It’s one he gave a hell of a lot of thought to and I trust him to make the right decision over what he thinks is best for English cricket. That’s what’s happened in this situation. I’ve got to go out there and do what I’ve been trying to do: win games of cricket for England.”</p> \n<p>More pressing for England – aside from this two-Test series against an aggressive New Zealand side that would lead to them dropping from fifth to seventh in the world rankings if defeated – is the appointment of a new head coach before the Ashes series in July. Gillespie is now understood to have spoken to Strauss over the telephone, with further talks imminent, although he has previously said he would need “serious persuasion” to leave Yorkshire, amid concerns over time commitments and the power he would wield.</p> \n<p>The county champions insist the ECB has not officially approached them yet, although a club insider admitted private contact was likely to have already been made and that events were expected to gather pace over the next 24 hours.</p> \n<p>Paul Farbrace, who previously worked with the former Australia fast bowler at Headingley and won the 2014 World Twenty20 when in charge of Sri Lanka, is currently in place as caretaker coach after the sacking of Peter Moores and while he would be interested in taking over full time, the former wicketkeeper would be equally happy to slot back into the coaching staff.</p> \n<p>“I just want to be involved in working with the team and helping the team and its players to get better,” said Farbrace. “I have enjoyed being No2, I enjoy working with players and I enjoy being in the nets and practising. Whatever job I end up in, so be it.”</p> \n<p>Cook, who has worked with permanent three head coaches in Andy Flower, Ashley Giles and Moores during his two-and-a-half years as England captain, believes making the correct appointment is of greater relevance than the speed by which it is made. “The most important thing is we get the right man for the job,” Cook said. “We’ve got Farby, who is a very fine man and has won at international level. In an ideal world we would all agree you want them in before the Ashes. But if that isn’t the case, we can’t do anything about it.”Such upheaval in English cricket has left many tipping New Zealand for the series. And while the rock-and-roll World Cup campaign in which they finished as runners-up to Australia may have come with the white ball, their belligerent approach to batting and the new-ball threat of Tim Southee and Trent Boult makes such predictions understandable.</p> \n<p>Their captain, Brendon McCullum, is wary of the home threat, however, in this 100th Test between the two sides. “England are obviously going through some challenges, we’ve been there and understand what every team has to go through,” he said.</p> \n<p>“But they are still stacked full of world-class players and in their own conditions will be a tough proposition. We are by no means thinking we have got them and know we’ll have to play extremely good cricket.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-c5f74902-b4cf-495f-89c5-b0ece5c0e3af\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432139680308/1bd6d0b9-d657-4514-af0c-9048226248c0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alastair cook\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The England captain Alastair Cook had plenty to ponder in the nets at Lord’s.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432128511205/Alastair-cook-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The England captain Alastair Cook had plenty to ponder in the nets at Lord's.

Some of these occasions can be a case of much ado about nothing but Wednesday’s extended World Cup squad – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/20/sam-burgess-england-world-cup-steffon-armitage\" title=\"\">a list so long it threatened to spill off the bottom of the page</a> – offers no end of dramatic possibilities in the next three months.</p> \n<p>No one is in much doubt that management already know the core of their final 31-man squad, but there remains sufficient intrigue around the edges to make the coming weeks extremely interesting. Stuart Lancaster is not yet entirely sure of his best options at wing, centre, hooker, prop, lock and back-row and is now challenging every fringe candidate to help him make up his mind.</p> \n<p>In no particular order these include David Strettle and Chris Ashton on the wings, both of whom have already nipped in ahead of Wasps’ Christian Wade, and Sam Burgess, who is being considered at both six and 12, placing pressure on the incumbents in both positions. Then there is Luke Cowan-Dickie, pushing Bath’s Rob Webber hard for the spare hooker role, and Maro Itoje, the 20-year-old Saracen who can be deployed at either lock or flanker. Alongside the reinstatement of Leicester’s fit-again Ed Slater, Itoje’s rise will be making Dave Attwood and George Kruis feel distinctly queasy.</p> \n<p>Five of the 50-man squad will not even make it to July’s training camp in Denver, with another 10 to be jettisoned prior to England’s first warm-up game against France at Twickenham. A further handful will then endure the cruellest cut of all before the final squad is announced at the end of August, leaving 31 survivors to shoot a documentary with Bear Grylls – sorry, contest the World Cup. Even the currently injured trio of Joe Simpson, Tom Croft and Ben Foden could yet re-enter the equation, with Lancaster suggesting Croft could travel to Colorado despite his non-inclusion in the original 50.</p> \n<p>If Ben Morgan’s recovery from a broken leg is in any way delayed, furthermore, Exeter’s Thomas Waldrom can also expect a call, although Lancaster has stressed only five back-rowers will make his final squad.</p> \n<p>“Training will be very competitive … the intensity of the camp will give us all the answers we need,” he suggested. “In an ideal world we would probably pick 60 because there are that many players we think are good enough.”</p> \n<p>Too many cooks? Lancaster prefers to regard the huge cast as a positive, repeatedly emphasising his desire “not to close doors too early”. His plan is to give many of the fringe candidates a run against France on 15 August before having “the most difficult conversations of all” with those not selected for every sportsperson’s ultimate dream: a playing role at a home World Cup.</p> \n<p>Burgess has already had that pleasure in rugby league, which would make it even more of an achievement if he makes the final 31 for the 2015 union version. It is further complicated by the fact Bath have increasingly been playing him at blindside flanker whereas England would ideally prefer him at inside-centre. Andy Farrell, who knows a bit about cross-code journeys, confirmed he would be running in both positions once the first stage of the training camp commences in Bagshot on 22 June. “How he plays won’t change as a 12 or as a six,” insisted Farrell. “We’ve seen the same running lines, the same big hits and the same ferocity in his collisions in both positions. But what we have seen is that, having started off at 12, he has developed as a rugby union player.”</p> \n<p>Lancaster also suggested that soft winter pitches and the unavailability of some of Bath’s key forwards had not helped the former South Sydney Rabbitoh to display his true worth earlier this year, emphasising that Burgess could further advance his cause with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/17/bath-leicester-premiership-semifinal-rabo12\" title=\"\">a good performance against Leicester in Saturday’s Premiership semi-final</a>. The same applies to Strettle and Ashton for Saracens against Northampton, with the management looking for experienced campaigners to combat the big wings likely to be fielded by both Wales and Australia.</p> \n<p>It is for reasons of defensive solidity that Wade, for now, has been overlooked, although he is set to feature alongside Danny Cipriani, Henry Slade, Elliot Daly, Joe Launchbury and Marland Yarde for an England XV against the Barbarians on Sunday week.</p> \n<p>There will also be a consolatory berth in that fixture for Exeter’s Dave Ewers, the versatility of Itoje and Slater having squeezed the big Chief out of the World Cup running. With Steffon Armitage and Manu Tuilagi not involved either, England will have to look elsewhere for powerhouse ball-carriers capable of making anyone think twice. With each passing day, the odds on Burgess making the final 31 appear to be shortening.</p> \n<h2><strong>The gatecrashers: </strong>five names to watch</h2> \n<p><strong>Sam Burgess </strong>Bath</p> \n<p>His late-season impact at blindside flanker for Bath has not gone unnoticed by England. They plan to involve him both in the back row and at centre during training next month and a good display in Saturday’s Aviva Premiership semi-final against Leicester will further boost his chances</p> \n<p><strong>Luke Cowan-Dickie </strong>Exeter</p> \n<p>Still young but the Cornishman’s feisty enthusiasm is precisely what England’s forwards coach Graham Rowntree wants to see his pack displaying. He is right on the heels of the Bath hooker Rob Webber who badly needs a strong end to his domestic campaign</p> \n<p><strong>David Strettle </strong>Saracens</p> \n<p>The winger’s inclusion after such a long absence is recognition of his consistent form and the fact that Stuart Lancaster has not quite settled on his best wingers. His experience will count in his favour, although a World Cup berth remains a long shot</p> \n<p><strong>Chris Ashton </strong>Saracens</p> \n<p>Scoring regularly for Saracens, as with Strettle, has earned him another chance when all seemed lost World Cup-wise. Still needs to get ahead of Jonny May and Marland Yarde in the race for the third specialist wing slot behind Jack Nowell and Anthony Watson</p> \n<p><strong>Elliot Daly </strong>Wasps</p> \n<p>Owes his inclusion to Manu Tuilagi’s brain fade but he has the talent, pace and footwork to embarrass the best defenders. If he carves up the Barbarians he could book himself a seat to Colorado, at which point he and Henry Slade would be vying for a utility back role </p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432143319131/Sam-Burgess-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sam Burgess has been chosen in England's 50-man training squad and is being considered at both centre and flanker by Stuart Lancaster.

The player suffered a concussion in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/09/crystal-palace-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">2-1 win at Crystal Palace</a> on 9 May which caused him to miss <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/17/manchester-united-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Sunday’s 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford</a>. England Under-21s’ next match is the warm-up with Belarus on 11 June, a month after that head injury, and the tournament starts a week later in the Czech Republic. The expectation would be that Shaw should have recovered from a concussion by then, which suggests he has another, more serious injury.</p> \n<p>Yet asked about this, Southgate indicated United had told him not to expand. He said: “A couple of squads ago we had a couple of injuries where we talked about detail and clubs are preferring us not to go too far.”</p> \n<p>Southgate could offer no explanation when it was put to him that Shaw should be able to recover in time from a concussion for the Euros. “I cannot answer that. These young players are not ours, we don’t own them,” he said, before claiming Louis van Gaal, the United manager, wanted Shaw to participate. “Louis has again been very supportive of him coming.”</p> \n<p>Last Friday, though, Van Gaal was vocal in stating Shaw should not be included on the basis the 19-year-old could suffer burnout. “I can’t comment, don’t need to and don’t want to comment on that,” Southgate said. “It is not a case of a rest, it is a case of him not going to be fit for us. We have 27 players [on the long list] who if we were giving the clubs the option of resting them they would take it.”</p> \n<p>The coach was clear that if a concussion were revealed by him the player concerned could be vulnerable. “We had a couple with injuries in the last camp and we started to go into detail of ‘It’s head’, et cetera and clubs aren’t very keen on that,” Southgate said. “They could go into fixtures the following week and someone could target that. I know historically we have always said: ‘He has a groin, he has a hamstring, he has a …’ Are those days over? Possibly. From our perspective, with younger players we probably have a duty not to go down that route,” he said.</p> \n<p>Southgate seemed unclear if the policy would extend to the senior team and that if, say, Wayne Rooney had to withdraw from a major tournament with an injury the FA could not identify it. “You would hope to get a timescale and an idea,” he said. “We know the timescale with this one: he is not going to be fit for the tournament.”</p> \n<p>Tottenham did not want Kane selected, either. But Southgate believes the striker is a different case “because Harry is fit, he is not injured”. He added: “Of course, we are mindful in selecting Harry that he has had a long season, many of the players here have.”</p> \n<p>Southgate agrees that Kane, who will be given a week off before joining up with the squad because of Spurs’ post-season trip to Malaysia and Australia, will be the player identified by the opposition as the team’s “Wayne Rooney”, despite other talented players, including Saido Berahino.</p> \n<p>“I wouldn’t suggest you have that conversation with Saido – but his [Kane’s] world’s changed enormously,” said Southgate. “He’s the pin-up boy and it’s a wonderful story and we hope this is the next part of it.”</p> \n<p>Southgate is clear Kane can handle the pressure. “He’s got a really strong mentality, he’s very focused in his practi</p> \n<p>ce, he’s very focused in his belief in himself,” the coach said.</p> \n<p>England’s opening group game is against Portugal on 18 June. They face Sweden three days later and Italy in the final match of the phase on 24 June.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432147744491/Crystal-Palace-v-Manchest-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Luke Shaw suffered a concussion in Manchester United's win at Crystal Palace on 9 May but would have been expected to recover in time for the European Under-21 Championships.

As has become customary, the European Tour’s annual gala dinner in London on Tuesday night gave a nod to Ryder Cup success. In this case, relating to last September’s demolition of the USA at Gleneagles.</p> \n<p>There was a break from custom, though. McGinley, the widely lauded winning captain, presented limited-edition imagery to his team members, their caddies, the vice-captains and Ferguson. The legendary Manchester United manager took to the stage, where he recalled being “right into this” from the occasion of a lunchtime meeting with McGinley in Alderley Edge which revealed the detail of the Irishman’s preparation.</p> \n<p>“I think great leaders plan better than anyone,” Ferguson said. “For the players, if they take it in, it’s a great route to success.”</p> \n<p>Ferguson revelled in his Ryder Cup role, which involved the delivering of a key team talk in Perthshire. Thereafter, he remained as part of the European inner sanctum. “It was my greatest experience outside of cup finals,” added the Scot. “It was simply fantastic.”</p> \n<p>The enjoyment was mutual and mutually beneficial. “I think it was very fitting,” said McIlroy of the extension of a gift to Ferguson. “I think I got more out of that talk on that Ryder Cup Tuesday night than some of the other players did because I had met Alex a few times and I knew him a little bit.</p> \n<p>“To be sitting there having a team talk from him, being such a huge United fan and a huge fan of his over the years, it was a special way to start the week.</p> \n<p>“It was nice that Alex came up on stage and got properly recognised. And as Paul said, he leaned on him quite a bit during a 12- to 18-month period. I’m sure that Paul learnt a lot from him. But I think at the same time, Alex was very impressed with what Paul had to say and what his ideas were. I think they worked very well together.”</p> \n<p>Individual rather than team matters will occupy McIlroy’s thoughts over the coming days as he attempts to successfully defend <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/may/25/rory-mcilroy-wins-bmw-pga-championship\" title=\"\">the BMW PGA Championship he concedes was won in “slightly weird” circumstances last May</a>. The immediate precursor to that single-shot victory was McIlroy’s calling off of his engagement to Caroline Wozniacki.</p> \n<p>Whether directly linked or otherwise, the Northern Irishman has been in routinely inspired on-course form ever since. His personal life barely merits a mention, partly on account of obvious contentment. “This is what kick-started everything, really,” McIlroy admitted. “This win, it gave me a lot of confidence to go on into the summer and do what I did. It was a real catalyst.</p> \n<p>“I felt like I was playing well before that, but I wasn’t able to turn good finishes into wins. I was finishing in the top 10 or top five but I wasn’t really contending too much in tournaments. So, for it to be the first tournament of the year where I got myself sort of into contention and to play a back nine on Sunday like I did last year, it did a lot for my confidence.</p> \n<p>“Who knows, if I hadn’t of had this tournament things might have been a little bit different. It definitely was the start of a great 12 months.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/18/rory-mcilroy-wells-fargo-bmw-pga-championship-wentworth-masters\" title=\"\">McIlroy’s victory at Quail Hollow on Sunday, his second in three starts</a>, strengthened his position at the summit of the world rankings. For now, the 26-year-old is untouchable. It is in the present McIlroy wishes to remain.</p> \n<p>“I don’t feel I’m unbeatable, that’s for sure,” he said. “Golf is a very fickle game and it can humble you quite quickly. So I definitely don’t think I’m unbeatable. Do I feel like I intimidate others? I feel like my name now carries a certain weight on the leaderboard. I don’t know if you call that intimidation but I feel that if players see my name on the leaderboard now, it might mean a little bit more than it used to.”</p> \n<p>His issue this time around may be fatigue. McIlroy’s hectic schedule of competitive events added to sponsorship and media commitments looked to have taken a toll on him by Wednesday afternoon. Unusually, the 26-year-old was a tad weary having just completed pro-am business in the company of Phil Neville, Paul Scholes and the One Direction singer Niall Horan. “There wasn’t much adrenaline in the body today,” McIlroy said. “Once I step on the tee tomorrow with a card in my hand, that will be different.”</p> \n<p>If not, maybe he could call upon Ferguson for another motivational message.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432137168695/Rory-McIlroy-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy begins the BMW PGA Championship on the back of two tournament victories in his last three starts.

Now he can also be counted as the best paid British sportsman in the world, ahead of the plutocrats of football, such as Wayne Rooney and Gareth Bale. He is also now the best paid driver in Formula One, ahead of Sebastian Vettel and Fernando Alonso.</p> \n<p>Hamilton’s new three-year contract – his current three-year deal expires at the end of the season – comes six months after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/23/lewis-hamilton-wins-f1-title-nico-rosberg\" title=\"\">he won his second world title, and his first with Mercedes, in Abu Dhabi in November</a>, following his success with McLaren in 2008. The deal means he will be almost 34 by the time his new agreement comes to an end. It is an age when drivers, even those as good as Hamilton, are forced to consider how long they have left in the sport.</p> \n<p>Talks between Hamilton and Mercedes have been in progress, loosely, since last year, but have been intense since January. The situation has been further complicated by Hamilton’s desire to negotiate on his own behalf, although he has received advice from a number of quarters, particularly from the London-based lawyer Sue Thackeray.</p> \n<p>Although both Mercedes and their star driver denied that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/11/lewis-hamilton-mercedes-three-year-contract-f1-130m\" title=\"\">the protracted negotiations</a> were a distraction, they were precisely that, with both parties repeatedly asked to field questions about the future of the relationship beyond the current season. And he was frequently linked with Ferrari, where Kimi Raikkonen’s future is uncertain.</p> \n<p>So was Hamilton relieved now it was all over? “No,” he replied. “I don’t feel any different to the last race.” But then he added: “But I guess sitting here, waking up this morning knowing that contracts will be announced today, thinking another four years here – I’m excited. It’s an exciting feeling. A real positive feeling. Solidified. I don’t have to worry about it, don’t have to give it a second thought, it is how it is and now I can go away and work towards my goal.”</p> \n<p>Any other decision on his part would have been foolish, of course – though most people said the same thing when he walked out on McLaren at the end of 2012. Mercedes enjoy an advantage over the rest of the field that is unlikely to be reined in – even by Ferrari – before the end of the year. Unlike football, which celebrates such occasions in the proper manner, there was a minimum of fuss about the confirmation of Hamilton’s new deal with Mercedes. Why can’t F1 handle these things in a better way?</p> \n<p>“I wasn’t even there [at the factory] when I signed. I printed off the documents and signed them on my own, and then the documents were released,” revealed Hamilton. “You don’t send it in the post. Someone else sends it for you.</p> \n<p>“I remember my first contract that I signed in 1997-98 and I remember sitting in the room with Ron [Dennis] and Martin [Whitmarsh] at the old McLaren factory. I think we just signed there in front of them and then we shook each other’s hands and went away excited.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton said he was always going to re-sign for Mercedes. “There was never any doubt, honestly. I was led to believe that the team wanted to continue with me and naturally with the success we’ve had and the relationship we have, it felt certain.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/10/nico-rosberg-wins-spanish-f1-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton\" title=\"\">Meanwhile, Hamilton’s team-mate Nico Rosberg</a> looked decidedly downbeat over a deal that could condemn him to be a world championship also-ran for the rest of his career. “I congratulated Lewis because it is great for him to sign a new contract,” he said, with an impassive shrug. “We have a neutral relationship and it is working.”</p> \n<p>The German, who extended his own deal with Mercedes last year, added: “It is a complicated battle because it is internal. We have to think about the team as well as thinking about each other. Both of us want to win and there are ups and downs and there will be another down but everything is OK right now.”</p> \n<p>And everything is OK right now, but it was at this street circuit one year ago that there was a famous coming together of the two, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/may/24/nico-rosberg-monaco-grand-prix-lewis-hamilton-f1\" title=\"\">when Rosberg was accused of ruining Hamilton’s bid for pole position</a>.</p> \n<p>There have been plenty of incidents since and now that both drivers are going nowhere, one of the most edgily competitive of team rivalries is scheduled to continue until 2018.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432143967631/Lewis-Hamilton-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lewis Hamilton says 'I don’t feel any different to the last race' after announcing his new £100m deal with Mercedes.
