And that might just be where we’re both going wrong. Because suspicions have been aroused this morning that there is more to the Argentinian’s inkwork than meets the eye, which is just as well because all that meets the eye is a collection of stars, numbers and smudges that look awfully like nearly everyone else’s tattoos. But here’s the thing: when Di Mar&iacute;a is placed under a special infra-red light, his body art actually contains coded clues to the location of an unimaginably vast treasure stash that hunters have been seeking for centuries.</p> \n<p>That, at any rate, is what the Mill has deduced from reports that <strong>Bayern Munich</strong> have grown so desperate to get their clutches on Di Mar&iacute;a that, in return, they are willing to offer Manchester United a large sum of cash, <strong>Arjen Robben</strong> and <strong>Thomas M&uuml;ller</strong>! And some reports go so far as to claim that the German club may even throw <strong>Bastian Schweinsteiger</strong> into the deal, too! Heck, if United stand their ground they may even be able to get Bayern to add Manuel Neuer, Pep Guardiola, a fleet of BMWs and the Hofbr&auml;uhaus.</p> \n<p><strong>Manchester City</strong>, meanwhile, are going to have to fork out a small treasure stash of their own if they are to land <strong>Kevin De Bruyne</strong>, especially now that Paris Saint-Germain have made the Belgian their No1 target. PSG are also complicating City’s quiet pursuit of <strong>Hachim Mastour</strong>, with the French club now the favourite to prise the 17-year-old Moroccan from Milan. But City aren’t going to dwell on that disappointment, instead they’re going to engage in more retail therapy and return to Anfield to give Liverpool the &pound;50m they want for Raheem Sterling. Better batten down the hatches, Southampton.</p> \n<p>Chelsea, Arsenal and Real Madrid are all linked with the Napoli left-back <strong>Faouzi Ghoulam</strong>, who has shown the skills he learned at the ever popular Footballer Media Training course by giving a textbook recital of the “flattered to hear about it, but just concentrating on my job” response to such speculation.</p> \n<p>Question: if Ryan Mason is as good as some fans claim, how come <strong>Spurs </strong>are plotting a bid of &pound;20m plus Aaron Lennon for <strong>Everton’s James McCarthy</strong>? And here’s another question: is the Mill right to be utterly bemused by reports that at least five clubs are preparing bids of up to &pound;15m for <strong>Andros Townsend</strong>? Explanations have yet to be provided by West Ham, Aston Villa, Swansea, Newcastle or Sunderland. One report this morning has gone so far as to claim that Spurs are unwilling to let the winger go for so little. The Mill has obviously drunk too much. Or not enough.</p> \n<p>Everton, meanwhile, fancy the Juventus midfielder <strong>Angelo Ogbonna</strong>, but will have to do battle with West Ham to get him.</p> \n<p>That David De Gea-Hugo Lloris chain reaction might be about to kick in, as <strong>Iker Casillas</strong> is poised to leave Real Madrid for Porto.</p> \n<p>Lyon are lining up another offer for the Marseille centre-back<strong> Nicolas N’koulou</strong>.</p> \n<p><strong>Stewart Downing</strong> is heading northwards, either to Sunderland or Middlesbrough.</p> \n<p><strong>Esteban Cambiasso</strong>, who has yet to sign a new deal with Leicester, could soon be part of Mark Hughes’s Stoke revamp. And so could Ali Al-Habsi, who will be drafted in as Jack Butland’s deputy if Asmir Begovic gets his dream move to become Thibaut Courtois’ deputy.</p> \n<p>Finally, goodbye.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/7/1436254461008/Angel-Di-Mar-a-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ángel Di María launches his come-and-get-my-tattoos plea.

It was getting irritating. Jason Holder and Denesh Ramdin had been batting for the past 32 overs, adding 105 for the seventh wicket to frustrate England. The pitch was slow, offering little, and the second new ball already more than 30 overs old.</p> \n<p>Before the over started Anderson, wearying, had walked back to his mark and engaged in conversation with Stuart Broad, standing at mid-off. “Try some leg cutters,” said Broad, “hold the seam straight down rather than across, fingers alongside and just rip it.” So Anderson gave it a go. The first one, to Ramdin, failed to grip on the pitch and held its line, and the batsman, a half century to his name already, defended it easily enough on off-stump. Anderson tried again. This time the seam caught the ground, the ball deviated away from Ramdin’s defensive prod, took the outside edge, and Alastair Cook made a tumbling catch at first slip. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/18/west-indies-england-first-test-match-report\" title=\"\">Anderson wheeled across to the legside in triumph</a>.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, Anderson acknowledged the part that his bowling partner had played in creating the record-breaking delivery. Bowling can be a solitary occupation, but within that it can also be collaborative. Broad’s habitual position at mid-off or mid-on when Anderson is bowling, and that of Anderson in the same positions when Broad is operating, are significant, at odds with the customary pace-bowlers post-over stroll to fine leg to graze and catch breath. The pair are in constant communication, and, as with the leg-cutter, bounce ideas from one to the other, communicating them through to Cook in his executive role.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/06/2005-alternative-history-greatest-ashes\">2005 and all that: an alternative history of the greatest Ashes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That fast bowlers hunt in pairs (leaving aside the exception of the West Indies side of the decade from mid-70s to 80s, who operated as an interchangeable pack) is one of the cliches of cricket. Some have become such that one bowler tends not be mentioned without the other: Fred Trueman forever allied with Brian Statham; Ray Lindwall with Keith Miller; Larwood and Voce; Hall and Griffith, Lillee and Thomson; Botham and Willis; Donald and Pollock; McGrath and Gillespie; and so on. Some are simply identified by first names, or even abbreviations, alone: Waz ’n’ Waqar; Curtly and Courtney.</p> \n<p>It will never be Jimmy and Stuart, but Broad and Anderson (somehow it trips off the tongue better that way round) should be included in the list. When they do so in Cardiff, no pair of England bowlers will have taken the field with more wickets between them than their 676, already 56 more than the total Botham and Willis had accrued by the end of the latter’s final Test in 1984. In matches they have played together, Anderson and Broad have taken 569 wickets – 296 to Anderson, 273 to Broad – which means a further 11 will see them overtake the Botham-Willis alliance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/06/ashes-2015-a-to-z\">Ashes 2015: the A to Z of Ashes history</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Partnerships such as this work in separate but distinct ways. The collaborative element, the sharing of information and ideas, is an important one but so too is the competition that such a relationship can create. A personal illustration might be the couple of years at Middlesex when I opened the bowling with Allan Jones. We were friends, travelled to matches together, shared a beer together. But he knew, because I told him, that although I enjoyed his own success and the contribution it made to the team effort, part of me still begrudged him every wicket he got because it was one fewer for me to try and take.</p> \n<p>It would be unusual if Broad and Anderson did not harbour similarly sentiments. Indeed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/englands-stuart-broad-puts-up-his-dukes-as-he-relishes-villainous-role\" title=\"\">Broad himself might be entitled to feel more than a little miffed</a> at the perception of the relative values of the two when it comes to the England team. In the lead-up to this Ashes series much has been made of the importance of Anderson, and his use of the new ball, to any possible England success. For some years, it is Anderson whose brilliance is seen as being absolutely integral to England, and there is no question that he has earned his place in the pantheon of great England cricketers. Broad on the other hand, is viewed as mercurial, inconsistent, off-the-pace all too often, and not infrequently the source of public opprobrium. Where Anderson’s place is inviolate, Broad’s often appears to be hanging by a thread.</p> \n<p>Look at the records of the two bowlers over the past two and a half years. Between them, they have taken fractionally more than half of England’s 459 wickets in that time. But which of them has taken most and at what cost? The answer to the first part is neither: since new year 2013 Anderson and Broad have both taken 115 Test wickets. They have done so at an average, for Anderson, of 27.00, and for Broad, of 26.53. Anderson has taken five wickets in an innings on five occasions and had a single 10-wicket match, the Trent Bridge Test at the start of the last Ashes series here. Broad though has seven five-wicket hauls in that same period and a 10-wicket match at Chester-le-Street in that same Ashes series. Anderson’s Nottingham haul, and that of Broad in the north east, were huge contributing factors in the two victories that secured that series. It may not be how the general cricket public perceives it but the Broad and Anderson partnership is of equals.</p> \n<h2>How the Ashes pace attacks compare </h2> \n<p><strong>England </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Jimmy Anderson </strong>England’s highest wicket taker and part of a formidable duo with Stuart Broad. When the ball swings and he can pursue a full length, there is no finer bowler in the world, his command of the ball mesmerising. Also dangerous when reversing the old ball. Has to work a lot harder for wickets when there is no lateral movement. Unusually, his default to left handers is to swing the ball away from them rather than challenge the pads.</p> \n<p><strong>Stuart Broad</strong> A counterpoint to Anderson. Broad can have quiet periods and then suddenly will get on a roll when wickets seem an inevitability. He has been successful when bowling a fuller length but it does not naturally suit the arc of his swing and can tend to float. When under pressure, he tends to drop his length back. Not a huge swinger of the ball, but height lends him bounce and he has an excellent bouncer.</p> \n<p><strong>Mark Wood</strong> Can be rapid and a relative lack of height means he is a skiddy bowler. Short run and explosive action, he tries to bowl a full length from which he can swing it, similar to Simon Jones. He is an excellent exponent of reverse swing which will be important if the weather stays dry. He has played few first class matches and, coupled with injury, there is a question mark over his stamina: after an excellent debut Test at Lord’s he was off the pace at Headingley. Will need careful management.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74fe817faa504b8f1534077970285d3bed4de3db\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436203821333/d1dd35f0-940b-41d0-ae35-81a5e24534a3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Wood's reverse swing could be crucial.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Wood’s reverse swing could be crucial.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Steve Finn</strong> Starting to get some confidence back after a trying two years. He is still not back to the sort of devastating pace he showed in India and New Zealand three years ago. There are kinks in his action that persist but he is still pacy enough to cause problems. He retains the capacity to take wickets and may well be used during the series.</p> \n<p><strong>Liam Plunkett</strong> Tall, willing, fast at times, and extremely fit. He too can exploit a fullish length, targeting the top of off-stump, but in the past has been used to rough up the opposition as well. Like Finn, he could well be used on a rotational basis, if not during this series then in the next six months.</p> \n<p><strong>Australia</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Johnson</strong> Nothing more than a simple change to the angle of his approach transformed him from a figure of fun to a world class bowler to be feared. Probably the fastest bowler in the world now, he will play a huge part in targeting England’s lower order. Can have his confidence dented though and has an unhappy experience of bowling in England. Rarely swings the ball into the right-hander intentionally but occasionally it clicks into place. His low delivery arm means his bouncer skids nastily.</p> \n<p><strong>Mitchell Starc</strong> Has the potential to be the bowler of the series now that Ryan Harris has been ruled out. A tall, pacy left-armer who swings the ball into the right hander and will have noted the success of Trent Boult earlier in the summer. He will enjoy bowling to England’s plethora of left handed batsmen.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dfd4d50ec6d1ff239e5a5ac793f6ad7e258917ab\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436203934782/a45700a1-a356-47fa-a4cc-6045de7315a2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mitchell Starc could be bowler of the series.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mitchell Starc could be bowler of the series.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Josh Hazlewood</strong> Tall, accurate and quick enough, he might take time to adjust his length to the demands of bowling over here. Once he has done so, he could well complete a formidable pace trio with Johnson and Starc. Comparisons are inevitable: for Hazlewood it is with Glenn McGrath.</p> \n<p><strong>Peter Siddle</strong> An absolutely indefatigable right-armer who for the cause will bowl until he drops, pick himself up and go some more. If Hazlewood cannot yet be trusted to do the stock job, then there is no one better than Siddle.

He has been in two of them, first wrestling with the bitterness of defeat by Roger Federer in 2012, then savouring the sweet triumph over Novak Djokovic the following year, as if the experience were a trial of his resolve.</p> \n<p>On a deceptively mild Monday afternoon, then, with a capricious breeze to sooth his reddening brow, he endured another hazardous part of the journey leading towards the ultimate test of his character, when he laboured for just over three hours to beat the Croatian mountain masquerading as a tennis player, Ivo Karlovic.</p> \n<p>Karlovic is a remarkable athlete. The physical advantage of a lithe, taut frame that stands 6ft 11in when stationary and extends perhaps another couple of feet towards the clouds when animated, is also the very vehicle of his demise. While he can routinely belt a tennis ball across the net at up around 135mph – as he did here many times in adding 29 aces to the 136 he had accrued in the first week – his crane-like legs do not always serve him well on the turn.</p> \n<p>And, in fashioning an artful, occasionally magnificent exhibition of defensive tennis to win 7-6, 6-4, 5-7, 6-4 and secure a place in the quarter-finals for the eighth year in a row, Murray turned the big man as if he were calling Dick Whittington’s cat. If winning grand slam titles was easy, Murray would be in the wrong job.</p> \n<p>Only Federer of this generation brings ease of execution to a sport riddled with difficulties for even the very best. So there was inevitability about a win that began in struggle, moved smoothly through dominance, back to anxiety and finished in tightly orchestrated drama. He had to resist four of those booming aces in the first 20 minutes and time and again was frustrated as Karlovic got out of trouble with his serve.</p> \n<p>But the 36-year-old Croatian, the oldest player left in the draw after three rounds, also showed several delightful bits of touch, none sweeter than a back-hand half-volley struck behind his spindly legs in the closing moments that delivered Murray one final sliver of angst.</p> \n<p>In the beginning it was all high-energy blasting. It is difficult to recall a rally that lasted longer than five shots in the first quarter of an hour.</p> \n<p>And the Croatian’s fifth ace, 134mph down the middle, banged the woman calling the lines on her head and set up his 40-love hold to level in the eighth game after half an hour.</p> \n<p>Subtlety arrived in the 12th game, when Murray twice lobbed his towering obstacle, then forced an error from him with a third effort, en route to a tie-break where the serve, surely, was favoured to prevail.</p> \n<p>It was the 563rd of Karlovic’s career, almost twice as many as Murray’s, and his 36th of the year (to Murray’s 15). This was Ivoland. But Murray forced an overcooked forehand to take the shootout.</p> \n<p>The second set was far more straightforward, Murray striking his fourth ace on his way to going 2-0 after an hour and a half.</p> \n<p>When they last met here, in the second round in 2012, Karlovic was positively red-lining with anger after being foot-faulted 11 times on his way to defeat.</p> \n<p>On Monday, it happened again – thankfully just once, and he aced to stay in touch in the third set. Maybe that was the spur he needed. By the end of the frame, he was on fire, and they went to a fourth.</p> \n<p>In the home stretch, which lasted 42 minutes, Karlovic still gave Murray occasional fits and it was not until near the end where the world No3 dipped further into his bag of class to make his obdurate opponent err for the 32nd and final time, hitting tired and long.</p> \n<p>“I came up with some good lobs, passing shots, able to use the angles a bit more, trying to keep him from coming to the net so much,” Murray said courtside.</p> \n<p>“Physically it is quite quick but mentally it is very tiring. It wasn’t going to be the best tennis, but I felt like I passed well. When he missed his first serve, I got the return on his second serve to his feet.</p> \n<p>Murray at least has what should be a less physically demanding assignment in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, against Vasek Pospisil, who has not taken a set off him in their three matches.</p> \n<p>The young Canadian earlier endured his third consecutive five-setter to beat Viktor Troicki 4-6, 6-7, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 over two hours and 39 minutes on Court 12.</p> \n<p>Murray said: “Pospisil is a tough match. He had a very close match with James Ward, came back from two sets to love today. He might be a little tired but confident for coming back. He has a game that suits grass, likes to come to the net, big serve.”</p> \n<p>If the 25-year-old Pospisil is leg weary on Wednesday, he will have good reason. After beating Troicki, he returned to Court 12 to partner the American Jack Sock in a third-round doubles match against Murray’s brother, Jamie, and the Australian John Peers. They kept Pospisil out there for almost three and a half hours, winning 8-6 in the fifth set – that’s brotherly love for you.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436202405390/Andy-Murray-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray is in the quarter-finals of Wimbledon for the eighth year in a row after his defeat of Ivo Karlovic.

Anderson had his day of days, routinely firing down pinpoint serves of 130mph and sending Djokovic scurrying in the relative few rallies.</p> \n<p>The agony went on for two hours, until Djokovic, two down and staring into the abyss, galvanised himself. Simultaneously Anderson seemed to lose an inkling of energy and a modicum of belief. By the time bad light stopped play at 9pm, Djokovic had secured two quick sets and had his rescue mission on track. But he will have seen enough to have no certainty about what happens when the two men settle the matter on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>A pattern established itself early; Djokovic no match for Anderson’s ferocity; was forced to rely on instinct, agility and clever placement; grace under cannon fire. Anderson could just swing away. He hit more than 30 aces. Everything was going in.</p> \n<p>Anderson started the tie-break the stronger, secured the mini break from the first exchange but Djokovic levelled, leaping improbably to his left to parry a backhand for a winner. With a deft lob that brushed the back of the line Djokovic went 2-1 up. Anderson broke back and the two men swapped blows until 6-6 when a hesitant Djokovic, long in his preparation, double faulted. Anderson launched another Scud to take the tie-break 8-6 and with it, after an hour, the set.</p> \n<p>Anderson began the second in the same belligerent mood with deliveries Djokovic could only flail at. In the fourth game, attrition told and Anderson got the break to go 3-1 up. Djokovic, grimly focused, increased his intensity, diving, stretching, lunging. He pulled it back to make it 3-2, and energised by the chink of light, held his own serve to draw level at 3-3.</p> \n<p>But still the Anderson artillery rained down. Djokovic went 4-1 up in the tie-break but Anderson kept pressuring. Soon it was 5-5. Then 6-6. After two mighty forehands and a deft drop volley it was 8-6, and Anderson two sets to the good.</p> \n<p>The champion – desperate for a boost – got one at the start of the third set with a break of Anderson’s serve to go 3-0 up. Even now Anderson was hitting powerfully but less reliably. With another break for 5-1 the champion took the third set 6-1 in just 24 minutes.</p> \n<p>Galvanised now by the sight of Anderson tiring and perhaps fallible, Djokovic also started the fourth set brightly. It took him three games to break serve. Suddenly Djokovic was imposing his game on the South African, driving him into corners and cutting off any responses at the net. At just after 8pm, in dwindling light, Djokovic whipped an angled forehand across the court, raised his arms. Finally, after three gruelling hours, he gained parity.</p> \n<p>It was the last act of an intriguing As the two men sat down, play was halted. drama. The winner will meet Marin Cilic and it is to Anderson’s credit that Cilic still cannot know who that will be.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436215893254/Novak-Djokovic-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Play was suspended due to bad light with the score between Novak Djokovic and Kevin Anderson poised at two sets all, 6-7, 6-7, 6-1, 6-4.

The Australian, who has divided opinion with his on court antics but often delighted crowds during the first week, was warned by umpire James Keothavong for an “audible obscenity” early in the second set.</p> \n<p>In the following game, which Gasquet won to take a 3-0 lead, Kyrgios appeared entirely uninterested, tapping his returns back into the net while pointing at the umpire.</p> \n<p>He denied he had stopped trying during the game in question, deflecting the question, but pointed instead to his subsequent resurgence to claw his way back into the match.</p> \n<p>“I mean, today, there was a lot of ups and downs. Obviously, you know, it was a tough, tough time, especially when he’s not missing any balls,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I’m getting frustrated myself. I feel as if I’m not playing not how I should be playing. I’m angry at myself.”</p> \n<p>International Tennis Federation rules state: “A player shall use his best efforts to win a match when competing in a grand slam tournament. Violation of this section shall subject a player to a fine up to $20,000 [&pound;12,860] for each violation.”</p> \n<p>An ITF spokeswoman confirmed that even though Kyrgios, who lost to Gasquet in four sets, was not warned by the umpire for lack of effort action could still be taken against him retrospectively once the video had been reviewed.</p> \n<p>“I don’t think I was treated unfairly,” said Kyrgios, who split with his coach Todd Larkham the week before the Championships. “If they decide to fine me they can fine me.”</p> \n<p>Even in defeat, the 20-year-old was the talk of the All England Club during a match in which he also complained about “external bullshit” and got into a lengthy exchange about the amount of time it took to change his socks after the umpire urged him to hurry up at a change of ends.</p> \n<p>“You know, I’m not perfect out there. I’m going to have ups and downs,” he said. “It’s the way you respond from that. I think it takes some serious balls to respond the way I did.”</p> \n<p>At other points, he loudly admonished himself for his serving or kept up a running dialogue with the crowd and his entourage.</p> \n<p>He refused to elaborate on his external issues, saying they were personal. “There’s a lot of things going on at the moment that aren’t focusing on actual tennis. There’s just a lot of stuff going on,” he said.</p> \n<p>Of an episode where he hugged a ballboy, he joked: “I just felt like a hug, I guess. Everyone now and then wants a hug.”</p> \n<p>Gasquet, who exorcised the demons of last year when he lost to Kyrgios in five sets and forfeited nine match points, said his opponent was “a very nice guy” but “was a little bit angry, a little bit frustrated” during the contentious episode in the second set.</p> \n<p>The French player went on to win the set 6-1 as Kyrgios threatened to fold completely. But he rallied in the following set only to lose the fourth on a tie-break.</p> \n<p>The Australian’s on court demeanor has attracted praise and opprobrium in equal measure, split between those who think the game needs more characters and those who find his behaviour unbecoming.</p> \n<p>During his first round match he received a code violation after refusing to play on following a disputed line call and was also picked up by a microphone muttering “dirty scum” - a comment he insisted was aimed at himself and not the umpire.</p> \n<p>During his second round victory over seventh seed Milos Raonic he was warned for bouncing his racket into the ground and failing to control it as it flew into the stands.</p> \n<p>“It is true, he likes the show, of course. Everybody can see that. But I still think it’s good to have some players like that on the circuit,” said Gasquet afterwards.</p> \n<p>“Sometimes people are talking because the players are boring or something. Now we have someone who is doing different things.”</p> \n<p>Following his defeat, a smiling Kyrgios later headed out to play mixed doubles with his partner Madison Keys as though he hadn’t a care in the world. They eventually lost in three sets, with far less controversy, to Lukasz Kubot and Andrea Hlavackova.</p> \n<p>Kyrgios said it was the best part of his day.

That was one of his most emphatic victories.</p> \n<p>Another win on 26 July would see him move from strength to stranglehold in this year’s championship after winning the British Grand Prix and extending his lead over his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to 17 points.</p> \n<p>“It has been a great track for me in my career, and I’m excited about that, and then we have the break,” Hamilton said. “I will be training like crazy over the break to make sure I am strong for the next part of the season. Generally in my career the second part of the season has been the stronger part for me.”</p> \n<p>It has not been lost on Hamilton that when he previously won at Silverstone, in 2008 and 2014, he went on to take the title.</p> \n<p>“That’s the plan,” he said. “That is what I am working towards. It is five out of nine now and I have had eight out of nine poles. I am told it’s been as strong a year performance-wise from me personally. Last year was exceptional for me and to think that I am doing it just as much as that but a little bit better this year, I didn’t think I could do that.</p> \n<p>“So I am overall really happy with that and now as I go to Hungary. I am happy, it has come together since last year but I am definitely enjoying it more now. I am enjoying life and racing more than ever.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton will go there given further confidence after his brilliant call to come in for fresh rubber on the 43rd lap at Silverstone just as rain and Rosberg closed in on him. He is an outstanding natural driver, but not necessarily renowned for the quality of his calls to the pitwall.</p> \n<p>“I never felt that was a strength of mine in Formula One, making those calls,” Hamilton added. ”Generally because the driver only has one view of everything and the guys outside have a better view, and so generally I would rely on the team. And definitely in the past there were times when they got it right and some times when they got it wrong.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton said the only other time he made a call at Silverstone was in 2008, and even though he was right he was overruled by his McLaren team. “That was the only other time I got the decision right apart from today. I don’t know how the future is going to go with that but I am glad I have ticked that one off.</p> \n<p>“I trust my judgment and I trust myself and all the decisions that I am making inside and outside of the racing world. There are opinions for and against those things but I am still driving the way I am driving, I am enjoying the racing and you can see it is all paying off.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton went to Silverstone knowing that Rosberg had won three of the previous four races, but he said: “The last race [in Austria] was the first time I felt he was particularly quick in the race.” Rosberg’s win in Monaco followed a mistake by the team on a weekend in which Hamilton had been totally dominant.</p> \n<p>The world champion added: “I knew how many people were going to be [at Silverstone], I knew the pressure, I’d been here before, I knew how important it was for me to really deliver.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436220980438/Lewis-Hamilton-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lewis Hamilton knocks back the bubbly after winning at Silverstone.

He would say he was the key figure, because that was the kind of guy he was,” said Craig Barrette, spokesman for USA BMX. “He was involved in every aspect of BMX.” </p> \n<p>The sport, which later took on some of the same high-flying freestyle features as skateboarding, now draws crowds of thousands and is an Olympic competition. </p> \n<p> Among its biggest current stars is Jamie Bestwick, a 13-time X Games BMX gold medalist, who was part of a social media outpouring in the action sports world for Breithaupt. </p> \n<p>“Sad to read about the passing of one of the all-time greats,” Bestwick said on his Twitter and Facebook pages. “Scot Breithaupt thank you for your amazing contributions and dedication to BMX.” </p> \n<p>Another BMX rider, Mike King, tweeted that it’s a “very sad day in the BMX world.” </p> \n<p>Breithaupt’s death was unexpected, and the circumstances are murky. </p> \n<p>Police responding to reports of a body near a shopping centre in the southern Californian city of Indio found him dead in a tent at a vacant lot, sergeant Dan Marshall said. </p> \n<p>Breithaupt, who was 57 and lived in neighbouring La Quinta, had been dead for an unknown time, and there were no obvious signs of foul play, Marshall said. A cause of death had not been determined on Monday. </p> \n<p>Breithaupt was a teenager and a competitive motocross rider when one day he saw a group of kids riding their bicycles in a dirt lot near his home in Long Beach, California. He was inspired to organize bicycle races on a dirt track similar to those used by motocross riders. </p> \n<p>Breithaupt became a BMX rider, winning several championships. He also became an early voice for the sport, introducing it to the nation in the early 1980s when it was televised on ESPN at a time when the network itself was new and specialised in novelties. </p> \n<p> Later, he started manufacturing bikes, founding the company SE Racing and creating several innovative frame designs, Barrette said. </p> \n<p>After retiring from active racing, he sold SE and started LM Productions, producing BMX and extreme-sport shows for ESPN and Fox. <br /></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/5/6/1399384449385/BMX-012.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Koen Van Weel/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"BMX","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Koen Van Weel/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T00:31:53Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T01:09:10Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Cycling","US news","California","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/california","webTitle":"California"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/scot-breithaupt-pioneer-who-helped-turn-bmx-into-olympic-sport-dies-at-57","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aex8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/07/scot-breithaupt-pioneer-who-helped-turn-bmx-into-olympic-sport-dies-at-57","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/07/scot-breithaupt-pioneer-who-helped-turn-bmx-into-olympic-sport-dies-at-57"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0df6832c7aeecd5bd699bf0289176c33178ab41c/0_59_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Scot Breithaupt leads the pack in a race in Las Vegas in 1976.
