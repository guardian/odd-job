I was actually thinking to myself, you know, what if they stayed hung up and I never boxed again?

There were questions about our team and not so much about Australia.</p> \n<p>“But that is credit to how our players have played and it’s nice to get that win when everyone contributes. It was not just two people carrying the team home but everyone can walk away from that game feeling like they have contributed.”</p> \n<p>He added: “Because first Tests of a series – especially an Ashes series – are nervy affairs, so no one wants to walk away with no wickets or no runs, feeling like you are trying to find your feet in the series. It is important that not everyone gets too carried away with one Test match.”</p> \n<p>Broad has warned England that, at 1-0 down in the series, Australia will be doubly motivated to correct their performance in that opener and the best way to damage them further will be to win the early exchanges. Either way, the 29-year-old expects another result “It all starts again on Thursday, so we need to get into the game and start well,” he said. “We know Australia have a lot of experience and will come back strongly. Having been in a team who have lost the first Test and are all up for winning the next one, if a team comes out and just hits you straight away with skill it can be quite deflating. So we need to start well. We are also well aware we had a bit of the rub of the green in the last Test. We won the toss, Joe Root got dropped [second ball before scoring a century]and a few decisions went our way. That happens in cricket and it might not be the same this week, so we’re going to have to work hard to get a win. We won’t change the way we play. We want to play attacking and aggressive.”</p> \n<p>With the turnaround between Test matches extended by a day by virtue of the quick result in Cardiff, Broad is happy that England needed only 70 overs to skittle the tourists for 242 on Saturday and are able to head into Lord’s with energy reserves intact.</p> \n<p>“When you are playing good cricket you want to keep playing,” said Broad, speaking at an event for the sponsors Hardys. “We have had back-to-back Tests in the past where there have been 200 overs in the field and you are knackered. But what did we field on Saturday? 60, 70 overs? It’s not taken too much out of the bodies. We are fresh and ready to go. So back-to-back Tests will suit us I’m sure. It’s a pretty good wicket to bat on but there have been a lot of results here. I expect it to be 1-1 or 2-0 at the end of the week.”</p> \n<p>While the two sides did not share a beer after the Cardiff Test, the England team did find a friend to celebrate with in Sir Ian Botham. The former all-rounder spent the Sunday before the series opener speaking to the team as part of a move by the director of England cricket, Andrew Strauss, to tap the knowledge of the greats.</p> \n<p>“We’re trying to get this relationship between ex-players and current players closer because ex-players offer us so much as a team and have so much useful information,” said Broad. “Beefy was a prime example of that, offering us advice and spurring us on each day. So we had a drink with him after the game.</p> \n<p>“When you hear someone like Beefy saying what it meant for him to play in an Ashes series and how proud he was of his playing career, it does spur you on. He gave us a congratulations chat after the Cardiff Test and the whole changing room was in awe of him. Those things are inspiring.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/13/1436814670302/Stuart-Broad-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stuart Broad said that every member of the England team contributed to the defeat of Australia in the first Ashes Test in Cardiff.

This is why he handles things so well.</p> \n<p>“It’s amazing, when you’re that young, you’d say one good night’s sleep to get over jet lag and he’ll probably be fine tomorrow morning, and especially coming off a win and shooting scores like that.</p> \n<p>“If he believes that’s the way to do it, then that’s the way to do it. That’s the way Jordan Spieth wants to do it. Guess what, it’s right.”</p> \n<p>Spieth has already won four tournaments this season and, though he has played only one round at St Andrews and was one of the later arrivals on the Fife coast, Faldo reckons that the Texan has a gift for learning new layouts in a short space of time.</p> \n<p>“Jordan has got this great ability – many people play practice rounds with him, one round, and the next day he’ll be talking about the golf course and they’ll have missed everything he’s talking about, all the little subtle slopes. So he’s obviously got a very high golfing IQ and he takes a lot on board.</p> \n<p>“Obviously that’s how he works with his caddie, Mike. They’ve got their own little formula and great belief in what they’re doing. And he’s confident. And he keeps churning out good shots. When you’re doing that, you just jump back on the saddle and ride again. That’s what he’s doing.”</p> \n<p>The only downside for Faldo is that the tournament is missing out on a showdown between Spieth and the injured world No1, Rory McIlroy, though he expects the in-form Rickie Fowler, who won the Scottish Open on Sunday, to contend.</p> \n<p>“Obviously Rory had a serious opportunity,” Faldo said, “so he must be kicking himself – as long as he doesn’t injure it. Hey, boys will be boys. They want to go and play and he had a weird and wonderful accident. I hope he gets himself fully fit and strong. It’s unfortunate with an injury like that, he’s got to get himself 100% fit before he can start the comeback. I feel for Rory.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436812071611/Jordan-Spieth-falls-over--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jordan Spieth of the United States falls over laughing in reaction to a putt during a practice round at St Andrews.
