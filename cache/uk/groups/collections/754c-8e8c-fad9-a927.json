The 29-year-old is one shy of Sir Bobby Charlton’s record, with San Marino awaiting in September when qualification can effectively be secured. His eight goals in 10 internationals have contributed heavily to the side’s unbeaten record this season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/slovenia-england-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report\">Slovenia 2-3 England | Euro 2016 qualifier match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Manchester United striker had missed a flurry of opportunities earlier in a frantic contest illuminated by Jack Wilshere’s first goals for the national side. “Wayne Rooney’s performance says a lot of things about him as a man,” said Hodgson. “Just before he took that chance he had taken a nasty blow from an elbow, which could have decked many a player and led to him losing his discipline. But it didn’t and he simply got up and played on.</p> \n<p>“The fact one or two chances had gone begging earlier also didn’t worry him because, when the ball fell to him four minutes from the end, he still stuck it away with aplomb. We can rely on that man. I’d have liked him to get a hat-trick today so all the talk of the record would have been finished, but he has plenty of time on his side to achieve that still.”</p> \n<p>Lineker was quick to congratulate Rooney, who now boasts 28 goals in qualification games for the World Cup or European Championships, on his achievement. “I’m pleased to be joined by Wayne Rooney on 48 goals,” he said. “It seemed, during a five-minute spell in the second half, it might not happen when he struck two over the bar, but Wayne’s been a consistently excellent player over the years.</p> \n<p>“I’m sure he will go on and surpass the great Sir Bobby Charlton. He’s still only 29 and he’s a formidable talent and he has a fabulous goalscoring record, especially in qualifiers.”</p> \n<p>Cesar was not cautioned for the elbow flung at the striker as the captains clashed inside the penalty area just after Slovenia’s equaliser, which had tied the game at 2-2. The pair had tangled once before, in a friendly at Wembley in 2009 when the England striker had won a penalty despite appearing to connect heavily with Cesar’s ankle. The Slovenian was booked and had subsequently spent a lengthy spell on the sidelines, describing the tackle as “stupid, stupid foul” at the time.“We thought it could have been a penalty,” said Hodgson of the incident in Ljubljana. “But the referee handled the game well. Slovenia are a strong, physical, aggressive team: Fabian Delph took an elbow to his jaw and Raheem Sterling a nasty kick at the end of the game as well. But the players showed their resilience. The team spirit is getting better all the time. They didn’t leave much on the field in terms of effort and determination.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-61235140-b8cb-4b8f-9c15-35aa07287ebb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434356506177/359706f9-fa9d-425d-a8da-2075daca0015-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jack Wilshere lets fly to score his second goal.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Wilshere lets fly to score his second goal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stu Forster/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While there was frustration at the nature of the first-half goal which meant England trailed at the break, stemming as it did from a Phil Jones throw-in deep in Slovenia’s half, Hodgson was hugely encouraged by the recovery mounted courtesy of Wilshere’s eye-catching brace. “His whole performance was quality,” said the manager. “I’m very happy with the goals he’s scored but, in the second half in particular, he controlled that midfield. If we can keep him fit and he can get plenty of PL [Premier League] matches and international matches, at his young age we think we’ve got a good player going forward. “We know we have excellent technicians in midfield in Wilshere, Jordan Henderson and Delph, James Milner and Adam Lallana, and that they’ve all got goals in them. Now they have to prove it. We’ll need their goals. We can’t just rely on our front players.”</p> \n<p>The win means England have now gone 11 games unbeaten since their elimination from the World Cup in Brazil last June, with this their first season without defeat since 1990-91.</p> \n<p>“The team has made progress,” added Hodgson. “It’s a good achievement, completing a season of 10 games with eight wins and two draws.

After that narrow, exasperating defeat at the Oval England were soundly beaten on the south coast by New Zealand by three wickets on another batsman’s paradise.</p> \n<p>Kane Williamson, magnificently measured, hit an effortless century; Ross Taylor, whose rehabilitation into the Kiwi side after the shenanigans of two years ago has been a beacon of dignified common sense, also reached three figures in the manner of an elder statesman. Thus the tourists were able to overhaul their target without too much bother. New Zealand were assisted by a fallible performance in the field from England. Four chances of varying difficulty went to ground and in this series, in particular, the bowlers need all they help they can muster.</p> \n<p>In another age England’s total would have been deemed formidable. In the twentieth century 302 won nine times out of ten but there has been rampant inflation, triggered by the advent of T20 cricket, flatter pitches, fresh fielding regulations, bats with a sweet spot as large as a football and faster, smaller outfields. Pity the poor bowlers. In golf the players now hit the ball further so what did they do? Lengthen the courses. In cricket batsmen hit the ball further so what is the response? Make the boundaries shorter.</p> \n<p>The defeat is a setback to the brave new world of England’s ODI cricket but it need not be a major one. England stuck to their determination to play carefree, fearless cricket. Indeed the phrase “We must bat the overs” must now be as outmoded in cricket dressing rooms as “Get me a couple of pints of bitter so I can wind down after the game”.</p> \n<p>England’s total might once have guaranteed victory but it now constitutes no more than a par score in 50-over cricket. There were more moments when onlookers were aghast at the audacity of the strokeplay, especially when Ben Stokes and Sam Billings combined in a pulsating sixth-wicket 61-run partnership in 34 balls. Stokes, as ruddy as a blacksmith, bludgeoned while Billings deflected impishly.</p> \n<p>Yet England will surely take note that they lost five wickets for 14 runs in 20 balls at the end of their innings. From 288 for five in the 42nd over they would have expected more. They certainly needed more. However, the captain, Eoin Morgan, was unrepentant about the batting. “We lost it with the ball”, he said afterwards. “Kane and Ross hurt us. If we had got one of those two early there was a chance.” He insisted that 302 “wasn’t bad” and that he was not disappointed that England failed to bat their 50 overs.</p> \n<p>Morgan is adamant that England should retain their aggressive outlook. “We are trying to change the process and the mindset with the bat and that may take time. I don’t want the team hesitating and questioning how they go about it. The guys are really enjoying the way they are playing.” Currently the mood beyond the dressing room is forgiving.</p> \n<p>After such a constipated World Cup there is relief that England are playing with fresh faces and freedom. The team is undergoing a rite of passage. The old ways had to be banished, therefore no backward step is permitted. It is a severe culture change, assisted by the presence here of New Zealand, whom England are minded to imitate.</p> \n<p>Hence the players must be given leeway. It will not do to be too grumpy at losing five for 14, especially when the final total is in excess of 300 for the third game in a row. But if this endearing new side is going to win their fair share of matches as well as friends, they will need to be smarter and to avoid squandering such positions. For the moment they are experimenting with having fun.</p> \n<p>The middle order fired again without producing the major innings. Joe Root purred along until he became tangled up against the unprepossessing spin of Mitchell Santner. Morgan, after a relatively watchful 71 from 82 balls, heaved and missed against Williamson, while Stokes smashed 68 from 47 balls.</p> \n<p>However, a callow tail betrayed their inexperience from the 42nd over onwards and the late-order collapse sealed England’s fate. For the Kiwis Ben Wheeler, on his debut, impressed – yes, it’s possible to impress with figures of three for 63 in this era.</p> \n<p>New Zealand stuttered at the start. Martin Guptill and Brendon McCullum were lbw to David Willey and Mark Wood respectively. But Williamson and Taylor could not be parted for 32 overs, during which they compiled 206 runs. For Williamson especially, batting seemed an effortless occupation.</p> \n<p>He played Adil Rashid, who did not bowl too badly, superbly. A combination of nimble footwork and deft timing sent the ball wherever the fielders weren’t. He took 18 from a blameless Rashid over, toying with boundary fielders and bowler alike: a masterclass of gentle demolition. And he also played the quicker bowlers pretty well.</p> \n<p>Taylor was not quite so fluent and was eventually out to an ugly heave against Willey. Thereafter the Kiwi tail, almost as careless as England’s, contrived to lose wickets needlessly, as if eager to be in unison with their opponents in this “friendly” series. England’s profligacy with the bat at the end of their innings had cost them dearly, whatever Morgan’s interpretation. But despite the defeat, no one is complaining much that they are going to stick to their new gung-ho style.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434304574860/Ross-Taylor-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ross

another physical contest that bore only occasional resemblance to the one-sided affair many had predicted at the outset.</p> \n<p>For the second straight game, Golden State pulled away in the final quarter, but got all they could handle from the midwest upstarts for 40 minutes. </p> \n<p>Cleveland tied the game at 75-75 with a little over eight minutes to go, before Steph Curry dispassionately narrowed his sights like an American Sniper. Curry sparked a 25-14 run with 13 points including three from the arc, two of them well-contested. He wouldn’t be denied and finished with seven threes and 37 total points. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/14/nba-finals-2015-cleveland-cavaliers-v-golden-state-warriors-live\">NBA finals 2015: Cleveland Cavaliers 91-104 Golden State Warriors – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Just as in Game 4, the Warriors found another gear near the end to leave LeBron James and company choking on their dust. It offset another extraordinary game by James. The man with CHOSEN1 tattooed across his back did everything but hold mass on his way to 40 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists.</p> \n<p>“He has the ball in his hands a lot. Stick with the program. Don’t get discouraged if he makes shots. He’s going to,” Curry said when asked about how to deal with James. “Over the course of 48 minutes, we hope we wear him down to make it very tough on him.”</p> \n<p>Yet James had to do too much of the work on his own. After losing All-Star team-mates Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love, the Cavaliers have been making do with role players asked to shoulder an increased role. While those players’ defense has been up to the challenge, they’ve had trouble filling the scoring hole left by their injured colleagues.</p> \n<p>James was a one-man wrecking crew as he reprised Thursday’s penetration-focused attack, taking the ball to the rim against pretty much every Warrior who tried to defend him. He hit 15-34 and generally got the type of shots he wanted, but the Warriors continued to keep his team-mates in check. The other Cavaliers went a collective 17-47 and only two players besides James shot any free throws. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Curry could lean on his running mate Klay Thompson. All season the Warriors, led by the prolific scoring duo, ran roughshod over Western Conference rivals like Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Like their Hollywood counterparts, the Warriors seem blessed. Their two stars inherited NBA DNA from their fathers, and were fitted into a “sexy, cute” Hollywood-ready style that’s a successor to Showtime, and the very apogee of fast-paced West Coast basketball. </p> \n<p>The sun-kissed Golden State duo hadn’t suffered much adversity on their way to 67 wins during the regular season, and rolled through the playoffs with very little resistance. But the Cavaliers made up for it over the first four games, slowing the Warriors pace with grind-it-out offense and skintight defense.</p> \n<p>Returning home the Warriors bounded out to an early 13-7 lead after getting four straight transition buckets. They’d get only 10 more points that way for the rest of the game as the Cavaliers caulked their transition D, and tied the scores up at the end of the first quarter behind eight points from James and JR Smith. The Warriors shut down Smith from then on, holding him to six points the rest of the way.</p> \n<p>Cavs coach David Blatt answered the Warriors small lineup by sitting center Timofey Mozgov after the first quarter and playing him but nine minutes all night, one game after the Russian scored a career-high 28 points. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile the Warriors beat the Cavaliers on the boards 43-37 and even grabbed 11 offensive rebounds, one more than Cleveland. The Warriors won the points in the paint too, 38-34.It raised further questions about Blatt’s decision to keep Mozgov on the bench, costing them their big inside advantage. </p> \n<p>“When you’re coaching a game you’ve got to make decisions,” said Blatt, defending the move. “I felt that gave us the best chance for us to stay in the game.”<br /></p> \n<p>After entering half-time with a one-point lead, the Warriors tightened around James, who couldn’t get anything to fall, shooting 1-6 in a quarter where only three players scored. Tristan Thompson scored 10 on his way 19 in the game. </p> \n<p>Golden State had nobody with more than two baskets in the third and shot 7-21 overall, but had assists on six of them, and that ball movement carried over to the fourth, as they went 9-17 led by Curry, who was 5-7 and had 17 for the quarter.</p> \n<p>Though it was rough-riding when they went down 2-1, Golden State have smoothed out the journey the last two games and shown the kind of resilience some felt they lacked. In the process, Curry and Thompson have been able to write the script and are moving quickly towards their Hollywood ending.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434335984941/acc8ca99-7b81-466a-91d5-5ba9ec54981e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ezra Shaw/Getty Images","altText":"Steph Curry","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T02:55:54Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T08:48:47Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":23,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["NBA finals","Cleveland Cavaliers","Golden State Warriors","Basketball","NBA","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/nba-finals","webTitle":"NBA finals"},{"id":"sport/cleveland-cavaliers","webTitle":"Cleveland Cavaliers"},{"id":"sport/golden-state-warriors","webTitle":"Golden State Warriors"},{"id":"sport/basketball","webTitle":"Basketball"},{"id":"sport/nba","webTitle":"NBA"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/nba-finals-golden-state-warriors-one-game-from-title-after-beating-cleveland-cavaliers","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49nt3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/14/nba-finals-golden-state-warriors-one-game-from-title-after-beating-cleveland-cavaliers","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/14/nba-finals-golden-state-warriors-one-game-from-title-after-beating-cleveland-cavaliers"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434335984941/acc8ca99-7b81-466a-91d5-5ba9ec54981e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Steph Curry came up with some huge points in the last moment of the game to help seal victory for his team.

The legs were tired after yesterday and the whole team suffered because of what they did. They all lifted themselves. Ian Stannard rode on the front behind the break for 100 kilometres, I don’t know how he did it.”</p> \n<p>The final stage resulted in a British one-two, with the 22-year-old Simon Yates showing he too is ready for the Tour by outsprinting Van Garderen and the 2013 world road race champion, Rui Costa, for second place, and clinching fifth overall, plus the best young rider’s white jersey.</p> \n<p>Another Briton, the former team pursuiter Steve Cummings, staked his place at the Tour for the MTN-Qhubeka squad, by figuring in the day’s main breakaway and leading the race over the penultimate climb until the race favourites made their moves in the final kilometres.</p> \n<p>Froome started the final stage 18 seconds behind Van Garderen, who had taken the race leader’s yellow jersey from the 2014 Tour winner, Vincenzo Nibali, when the Italian cracked on a short, steep climb close to the end of the stage. That thin advantage, and the 10 seconds bonus on offer for winning the stage, meant that Sky had to ensure their leader was in a position to dislodge the American on the ascent to the finish and, if possible, take the stage victory.</p> \n<p>On the steepest section of the climb, with 2.5km remaining, Froome made a typical attack to swoop past Cummings and open a few metres gap on Van Garderen. In a carbon copy of the previous day’s final phase, Van Garderen slipped gradually backwards as Froome pulled away in his ungainly but efficient climbing style, like a praying mantis in its death throes, arms akimbo, legs spinning wildly and his head constantly flicking up and down.</p> \n<p>Van Garderen has twice finished fifth in the Tour and looks set to be another major actor in July, but he seemed to have gone too deep in his initial response to Froome’s attack. He slowed definitively with a kilometre and a half to go, allowing Yates and Costa to close on him, with Yates taking the six second time bonus for second place. The upshot was Team Sky’s fourth Dauphin&eacute; title in five years, making up for Froome’s mixed fortunes in the 2014 event when he lost the overall lead after a heavy crash.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/chrisfroome/statuses/610100702447304704\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Done! <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dauphine?src=hash\">#Dauphine</a> 👍😊 <a href=\"http://t.co/KvUBpC5dC7\">pic.twitter.com/KvUBpC5dC7</a></p>— Chris Froome (@chrisfroome) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisfroome/status/610100702447304704\">June 14, 2015</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>If Froome emerged from the Dauphin&eacute; as the favourite for the Tour de France, Nibali did enough to suggest he too will be at his best when the Tour starts in Utrecht on 4 July, and as in 2012 and 2014 in the Dauphin&eacute; he looked to be carefully selecting the moments in the race when he wanted to test himself.</p> \n<p>He went missing in the first major sort-out, stage five to Pra-Loup, and did so again on Saturday, but figured in a day-long escape on Friday’s rain-hit stage through the Vercors and shredded the field with a lengthy effort at the foot of the climb to Modane.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434298309945/Chris-Froome-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Froome also won the Criterium du Dauphine in 2013 on his way to victory in the Tour de France.
