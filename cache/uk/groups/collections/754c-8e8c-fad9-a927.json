New Zealand made progress with the bat at a decent lick until two wickets fell in the space of three balls mid-afternoon to upset momentum but well as Martin Guptill and Tom Latham played, it somehow seemed less urgent than it had when it was Ben Stokes and Joe Root turning round the England innings.</p> \n<p>The pitch had flattened out too, as it usually does after a flirty first morning, and there was no significant swing despite a blanket of light cloud and the occasional stirring of a breeze. In the stands , the wine still flowed and the champagne popped (only at Lord’s could there be a steward whose role seemed to include collecting errant corks from the outfield). The sun came out later though, and with it Kane Williamson (92 not out), who survived a stumping chance in the penultimate over of the day, and Ross Taylor (47 not out) calmly fashioned an accomplished unbroken third-wicket partnership of 155.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2015/may/22/england-new-zealand-first-test-day-two-in-pictures\">England v New Zealand: first Test, day two – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The pair placed New Zealand in a position, 303 for two, a deficit of 86 from which, if the weather holds on the third day, they will be confident of a substantial first-innings lead and the opportunity to place England under real pressure second time around. England need success with the second new ball.</p> \n<p>Guptill and Latham were able to add what is only the second century opening partnership for New Zealand at Lord’s. For Guptill, it represents a return to Test cricket after an absence of two years and a modest record before that which has brought him two centuries only, one each against Zimbabwe and Bangladesh. He has become a mighty one-day player, who made an ODI hundred here two years ago so it is not alien territory.</p> \n<p>Guptill is an uncomplicated player, tall with front foot dominating as a consequence, a powerful driver of the ball who hit eight boundaries and a six cudgelled off Moeen Ali into the Tavern stand with a slog-sweep swing of the bat. Latham is less obtrusive, a left-hander, who like most of his ilk, enjoys the freedom of the extra width allowed him when the ball comes across him: prolific square of the wicket, in other words, and accumulative off his legs.</p> \n<p>Both though were given reprieves that cost England while the ball was relatively new. Guptill had made only 24 when he appeared to have become a first Test match wicket for a triumphant Mark Wood during an impressively rapid first spell, in which, from a short run and explosive action, he touched the mid-90s. It was challenging stuff and sure enough Guptill edged fast to Alastair Cook at first slip who held the ball well. Yet even as Wood celebrated, he had been asked to wait, for Sundaram Ravi, the Indian umpire, suspected a front-foot transgression which, after prolonged close scrutiny by the third umpire, was ultimately confirmed so that Guptill survived.</p> \n<p>These things have proved costly in the past, most recently in Antigua when Ben Stokes, not for the first time in his career, took a wicket, that of Jermaine Blackwood on that occasion, who, 21 at the time, went on to make an unbeaten 112. There has been a thought in the past that the umpires themselves were doing little to help bowlers who push the line, by keeping quiet so they may not be aware how close they are. This turns out not to be the case and rather there is, from most anyway, a constant dialogue between officials and players, which makes any no balling just unprofessional.</p> \n<p>Latham was given a reprieve in a more orthodox fashion, for having made 21 he edged Stokes, in the middle of a really good spell from the Nursery end, low to second slip where Ian Bell failed to cling on.</p> \n<p>The pair went on to add 148 before a sudden hiatus interrupted the flow of the batting. First Latham, on the back foot, attempted to work Moeen, around the wicket, to square leg, missed and was unquestionably lbw for 59. Three balls later, Guptill, to his evident chagrin, drilled Stuart Broad low and crisply to extra cover where Gary Ballance took a tricky chance well.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/22/new-zealand-martin-guptill-tom-latham-opening-partnership-test-cricket-one-day-link-england-lords\">Martin Guptill brings back Lord’s memories of Trevor Franklin, sort of | Vic Marks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It meant two new batsmen together at the crease and immediately Taylor, who tends to go a long way across his stumps was subjected to a vehement appeal for lbw to his first ball from Broad the ball hitting him fractionally outside the line of off stump and a shade too high. He was then all but run out as Williamson attempted a drop-and-run quick single that Broad, adrenaline pumping, followed up well to retrieve with Taylor having given up the ghost. Broad dived and flicked at the stumps but was well wide of the mark so that Taylor survived.</p> \n<p>England, 354 for seven overnight, had been bowled out in the first hour for 389, with Moeen making 58 before becoming one of two more victims for Trent Boult, who finished with four in all. It meant the innings – 30 for 4 at the start, and the last three wickets for 35 – was something like a sandwich of Wagyu beef placed between two slices of Mothers Pride.</p> \n<p>Just as in Barbados, when Alastair Cook, already with a century, was out to the last ball of the day, leaving one end open , so this time with the departure of Jos Buttler to Boult. It meant Moeen would have to marshall the tail which, having reached his half century, he was unable to do, surprised by Boult’s extra bounce and edging behind.</p> \n<p>Broad can barely bat his eyelids these days, and although Jimmy Anderson and Wood added 21 for the last wicket, what had the potential to be 450 runs or more, finished disappointingly with a job well done by New Zealand, and Boult, with the second new ball, in particular.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432318876296/Kane-Williamson--006.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kane Williamson’s unbeaten 92 gave New Zealand the edge at the end of day two at Lord’s as the tourists reached 303 for two in reply to England’s total of 398.

Can anything be done ahead of Sunday’s race?</p>","byline":"Tom Bowles","body":"<p>The Indianapolis 500, America’s premier open-wheel race, has always been known for raw speed. Drivers circle around the track using a daredevil mix of drafting, handling and strategy to wind up in victory lane. But in 2015, the month of May at Indianapolis has revolved around a different type of buzzword.<br /></p> \n<p>Survival.</p> \n<p>No less than four drivers have lost control and seen their IndyCars flip over this month, causing the type of carnage the track is no longer used to. The latest victim, Canadian James Hinchcliffe, escaped near-death when a major artery was punctured by debris once his No5 Honda skidded into the wall, then turned over as the car made its entrance into turn three. Thankfully, he’s expected to make a full recovery although it’ll be months before he drives a race car again. Helio Castroneves, Ed Carpenter and Josef Newgarden have escaped similar flips uninjured while Great Britain’s Pippa Mann endured a hard wreck of her own.</p> \n<p>IndyCar has deemed the situation so serious they shut down practice after Hinchcliffe’s wreck, an unprecedented three-hour step as they launched a full-scale investigation into what’s happening. Track officials were alarmed recent moves to cut speed, reducing the ‘turbo boost’ each car had at their disposal (costing them about 40 horsepower) hadn’t changed the ability for cars to lift. Monday’s crash still occurred as teams transitioned to race setups, a switch to more downforce and stability while they work on surviving a full 500-mile race instead of a few short qualifying laps. In theory, a full fuel load should keep cars grounded but instead a simple suspension failure left Hinchcliffe’s life in the balance.</p> \n<p>Some drivers, anxious over a pattern that won’t go away have blamed the flips on rising speeds. Laps this year were cracking the 230mph barrier in practice as the sport’s new aerodynamic package looked to challenge old records that haven’t been touched in nearly two decades. The four-lap average of Arie Luyendyk, who paced the track at 236.986mph was what drivers were shooting for, a mark set in 1996 when the sport was near the height of its popularity. It’s also the last year a driver died in Indy 500 practice, when pole sitter Scott Brayton crashed hard into the outside wall in a move that led the series to back off that type of chassis. The ‘230’ magic number is seen as a ceiling for open-wheel cars the same way Nascar views 200mph as a danger zone at their biggest tracks, Daytona and Talladega. Stock car racing uses restrictor plates to strip horsepower at those places the way IndyCar was stripping engine boost in the wake of these wrecks.</p> \n<p>“We hope to go faster,” said Mark Miles, CEO of Indycar and Indianapolis Motor Speedway in announcing the changes Sunday. “But we’re going to do so being responsible. Safety is the first priority.”</p> \n<p>Sadly, those changes weren’t enough to stop Hinchcliffe from flipping; if not for an energy-absorbing Safer Barrier, his incident could have been far worse. Drivers like Carpenter have been outspoken about concerns flipping could weave its way into a crowded racetrack, 33 entrants fighting for space in the race and inevitably making contact over the course of 200 laps.</p> \n<p>The problem appears to revolve around design, new 2015 oval aero kits making their debut at the 2.5-mile oval. These kits are an engineer’s dream, over 100 pieces outfitted to speedway cars and designed for ingenuity and to reduce aerodynamic dependence. Chevrolet and Honda, the two competing manufacturers built different kits but they’re connected to the same Dallara DW12 chassis approved for all competitors. INDYCAR implemented the changes looking to build on its last three 500s, each of which have produced a record number of lead changes in the track’s long and storied history (Sunday’s running is the 99th edition of the race).</p> \n<p>However, adjustments in the rear of the car have changed the way air circles over the rear wheels, in particular where they’re supposed to be covered along with the rear wing. If a car gets sideways, the right mix of air begins to lift the car with no safety net (think NASCAR’s roof flaps) to keep it firmly planted on the ground.</p> \n<p>“Everyone has opinions,” said Carpenter Monday to the Associated Press. “Whether it’s the aero kit, an underwing issue or whatever it is, we need to find out.”</p> \n<p>Solutions have run the gambit, from installing a fully-concealed cockpit protecting drivers from any potential flips to a radical redesign of the car’s rear. Neither will likely happen by Sunday as the series relies on minor tweaks to slow speed and increase the likelihood cars stay on the ground. Carb Day, the final practice before the race produced no issues as the series moves full steam ahead toward Sunday’s race.</p> \n<p>For their part, the drivers are split on potential danger. Some, like France’s Sebastien Bourdais think the media has overblown the issue, sidestepping the truth that racing will always be inherently dangerous.</p> \n<p>“We’re going [240mph] in between walls,” he exclaimed Thursday. “Let’s put this in perspective. Did anyone really believe this was safe?”</p> \n<p>Come Sunday, millions of fans and a few dozen drivers will cross their fingers and hope that answer is still yes.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/07f75ba77afdd13324a79bd8597fe95c1757e373/0_0_2650_1589/2650.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1589,"width":2650,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jamie Gallagher/AP","altText":"Ed Carpenter","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jamie Gallagher/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-23T08:00:02Z","lastModified":"2015-05-23T08:00:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Indycar","Motor sport","Sport","US sports","Nascar"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/indycar","webTitle":"Indycar"},{"id":"sport/motorsports","webTitle":"Motor sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/nascar","webTitle":"Nascar"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/23/why-are-so-many-indycars-crashing","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/496mj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/may/23/why-are-so-many-indycars-crashing","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/23/why-are-so-many-indycars-crashing"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/07f75ba77afdd13324a79bd8597fe95c1757e373/0_0_2650_1589/2650.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1589,"width":2650,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ed Carpenter hit the wall in the second turn on Sunday during practice ahead of the Indianapolis 500.

In the following period he has been exceptional for me. He has had dips in form and performances but only because his standards are so high. He’s a young man who has obviously passed on his career to other people and, unfortunately, whether people perceive it as right or wrong, he is being led by the representative. But the young boy I see on a daily basis and who I work with is still the same boy who wants to learn and I think the supporters will just continue to show what they always do, which is wonderful support for every player in the Liverpool shirt.”</p> \n<p>Rodgers claimed a hostile reception for Sterling would not influence his selection at Stoke and that the winger had been unaffected by this week’s controversy, albeit with the caveat his plans could change late on. He said: “I think with Raheem his character is unquestioned. He is really strong mentally but he’s also a human being as well and a very young one at that. There’s no doubt these type of things can affect players but what I know of Raheem is that he’s a strong boy who is continuing to work hard. It hasn’t affected him in terms of trainingbut of course I will always gauge that up until the very last minute.”</p> \n<p>Arsenal and Manchester City are among the clubs monitoring developments. Ars&egrave;ne Wenger said on Friday he would not be put off pursuing a player by the issues surrounding Sterling. “I’m not sure it is the player who causes the problem,” Arsenal’s manager said. City’s Manuel Pellegrini described Sterling as “a very important player” who all elite clubs would want.</p> \n<p>Rodgers will be under scrutiny once the season is over with a review into what he described as a campaign “full of distractions” scheduled with FSG’s president, Mike Gordon. FSG wants a thorough investigation into where the season went wrong for Liverpool, including the poor return on last summer’s &pound;117m investment on new players, but Rodgers insists he and the owners remain in agreement over the long-term strategy for the club.</p> \n<p>“There has probably been a lot more made of the review than what it actually is,” he said. “I’m constantly reviewing with the owners. It is very clear in terms of how the model works here. That doesn’t change. Everyone here is aligned to that. For us it is really about analysing this year in terms of all the plans, all the changes that took place last year, review that, how can we be better equipped to move forward and challenge. That will be the review.”</p> \n<p>Asked if he felt assured by FSG that he would still be Liverpool manager next season, Rodgers replied: “Yes, 150%.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432313913590/Liverpool-Training-Sessio-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Raheem Sterling trains with his Liverpool team-mates ahead of Sunday's Premier League match at Stoke City.

And now Ecclestone has talked about his vision for 2017.</p> \n<p>“I’ve been pushing, pushing, pushing for single chassis, single engine, and run it exactly the same as now, but they [the teams] can’t muck around with the car,” he said.</p> \n<p>“So you do that with four or five teams and you leave the constructors alone. You let them do what they want to do. You would make all the chassis the same, and then we would do a deal with one of the engine suppliers. It should work.”</p> \n<p>This is exactly what the small, independent teams have been fearing, because they would lose their status as constructors. Customer cars would threaten the existence of teams such as Sauber (who have already said they would not compete), Force India and Lotus, who would be the also-rans in a two-tier system. Effectively, their chances of pulling off a shock win, one of the great attractions of F1, would diminish.</p> \n<p>Ecclestone argues it would bring an end to the pay driver, who brings sponsorship money to a team. “Instead of having to run around and find a driver who has money, they could look for a talented driver and put him in the car. You would then get a lot more new drivers with a lot more talent.”</p> \n<p>Those noisy neighbours Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg, who both live here, are preparing for what could prove to be a crucial meeting on Sunday.</p> \n<p>Rosberg will be attempting to become the fourth driver, after Graham Hill, Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna, to win a hat-trick of races at Monaco. But, more important than that, he will be attempting to maintain his momentum following his victory in the last race in Barcelona. Another win would bring the championship to life. Hamilton, who was fastest on Friday in second practice, leads his rival and team-mate by 20 points.</p> \n<p>Hamilton has denied suggestions his globetrotting lifestyle has led to a lack of focus. “I don’t need to think about that. I just do me, I don’t judge anyone. People have the right to have their own opinions. I have two world championships now. I know what I’m doing, if I’m burning myself out, or burning both ends of the candle. If I feel fit and I feel fresh and I feel good I’m going to do those trips. You have to do what makes you feel happy. There are a lot of bonuses and positives which come from doing things that you want to do.</p> \n<p>“But I want to win this weekend. There was one thing that happened in qualifying which offset us a little bit [in Barcelona].Ultimately, I wasn’t quick enough. But it wasn’t because I was travelling or anything like that.</p> \n<p>“Nico was just quick that weekend. I’ve been home these past two weeks. I feel solid, I feel fresh, I know the importance of being on the time zone here. People are going to have opinions about different things. But I just do me. Like it, love it or leave it.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton has also been enjoying life in his home town. “It can’t always be work, work, work, while everyone is partying in the clubs. So you want to enjoy it. It’s great to be here. The weather’s fantastic. Later on I might get in my car or on my motorbike or go on a cruise somewhere. Or go jet-skiing. Who knows? But I want to make sure I enjoy this weekend.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432315810306/Bernie-Ecclestone-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bernie Ecclestone and his wife, Fabiana Flosi, walk along the circuit in Monaco before Sunday's race.

James scored 11 points, the Hawks shot just 32% (seven of 22), and Cleveland led by as many as 20 before settling for an 84-66 lead heading to the final period.</p> \n<p>Irving was scratched before the game because of an ailing left knee. He wasn’t missed a bit.</p> \n<p>James assumed many of the ball-handling duties, taking advantage of DeMarre Carroll clearly not being at 100%after he went down with a knee injury late in Game 1. Carroll started after being carried off the court just two nights earlier but hardly looked at his best. <br /></p> \n<p>He wasn’t the only one struggling. The Hawks looked totally outclassed for one of the few times all season. The Cavaliers can wrap up the best-of-seven series simply by winning at home. The next two are in Cleveland, beginning with Game 3 on Sunday night.</p> \n<p>Tristan Thompson led another dominating performance for the Cavaliers on the boards. He had 16 rebounds and Cleveland finished with a 47-39 advantage.</p> \n<p>When Thompson dunked off a pass from James with just under five minutes remaining, the Cavaliers had a 93-74 lead and many Atlanta fans began heading for the exits, perhaps believing they had seen their team for the last time in this most unexpected season. Atlanta won a franchise-record 60 games to claim the top seed in the East, but the Hawks were picked apart by the best player in the world.</p> \n<p>The Cavaliers are two wins away from returning the NBA Finals and taking another crack at their first championship. This is why James returned to his de facto hometown after spending four years in Miami, leading the Heat to a pair of titles. The Cavaliers assembled a Miami-like trio with James, Irving and Kevin Love, but the King is doing just fine on his own with Irving hobbled and Love out with a season-ending injury.</p> \n<p>The Hawks had hoped that Carroll’s appearance would provide an emotional boost. An injury that looked much more serious when he helped off the court in Game 1 turned out to be only a sprain, and he drew a big cheer from the crowd when he did his customary sprint across the court during the opening introductions.</p> \n<p>But at less than full speed, Carroll had no chance trying to guard James, who made 10 of 22 shots including a pair of three-pointers. When the Hawks began collapsing toward the lane, trying to give Carroll help, James always seemed to fine the open man — often lurking behind the 3-point arc.</p> \n<p>James had 11 assists, and the Cavaliers finished 12 of 30 beyond the arc. The King just missed a triple-double, grabbing nine rebounds.</p> \n<p>Dennis Schroder led the Hawks with just 13 points. Carroll managed only six points in just under 34 minutes.</p> \n<p>Carroll wasn’t the only one hurting. Kyle Korver got his right ankle rolled going for a loose ball late in the third quarter and didn’t return. Al Horford banged his knee early in the fourth and hobbled to the bench, though he was able to finish out the game.</p> \n<p>It didn’t really matter. By the end, the Hawks had cleared their bench.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432350637986/e5b679c5-03ba-4851-8143-ae846c185003-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Brett Davis/USA Today Sports","altText":"LeBron James and Iman Shumpert ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Brett Davis/USA Today Sports"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-23T03:11:17Z","lastModified":"2015-05-23T03:15:57Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":7,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["NBA","Cleveland Cavaliers","Atlanta Hawks","LeBron James","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/nba","webTitle":"NBA"},{"id":"sport/cleveland-cavaliers","webTitle":"Cleveland Cavaliers"},{"id":"sport/atlanta-hawks","webTitle":"Atlanta Hawks"},{"id":"sport/lebron-james","webTitle":"LeBron James"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/22/eastern-conference-finals-lebron-james-drives-cavaliers-to-2-0-series-lead","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/496za","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/may/22/eastern-conference-finals-lebron-james-drives-cavaliers-to-2-0-series-lead","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/22/eastern-conference-finals-lebron-james-drives-cavaliers-to-2-0-series-lead"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432350637986/e5b679c5-03ba-4851-8143-ae846c185003-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"LeBron James and Iman Shumpert are part of a Cleveland team who look in complete control of the series.

Rory McIlroy’s missing of the cut at the BMW PGA Championship perhaps is not much of a shock, given the fatigue displayed by the world No1 all week. Still, any event is a poorer place minus McIlroy, something that will not be lost on the organisers of a tournament already lacking some big names. The 26-year-old has prided himself on consistency over the past year, a quality that eluded him .</p> \n<p>McIlroy signed for a second-round 78 and plus five aggregate that will afford him extra time to prepare for next week’s Irish Open at Royal County Down. Given the demands likely to be placed on McIlroy on home soil, there appears an element of cloud and silver lining there.</p> \n<p>This marked McIlroy’s highest 18-hole score since the second day of the Scottish Open last July, where he carded an identical number. A run of four dropped shots from the 10th did irreparable damage. “I am obviously disappointed but a weekend off is probably what I need,” he said. “This will allow me to go to Royal County Down over the next few days and maybe play a few holes with nobody around.”</p> \n<p>At 10 under par, Francesco Molinari remains the man to catch. He is seeking to become the second Italian in three years – Matteo Manassero won in 2013 – to triumph in the PGA Championship. “I know how hard I have been working over the last few months so it is nice to see that paying off on the course,” he said.</p> \n<p>Luke Donald’s second 70 was notable as the Englishman looks to pin down the top‑60 world ranking place needed to secure a US Open berth. As a two-times winner here, Donald may well be inspired by familiarity. Equally striking, though, was Donald’s criticism of the greens. He is not, it has to be remembered, an isolated voice on this topic.</p> \n<p>“They have gotten worse each year since they re-did them,” Donald said. “They don’t look very good on television, they putt OK, but there are a few putts out there that don’t stay on the line you hit them.</p> \n<p>“If there was one championship that the greens should be pristine then this is it because this is our biggest event, our flagship event and they don’t putt as good as they should. I think the only way to fix them is to redo them again.</p> \n<p>“I am not sure what the problem has been because there are other courses in this area with good greens. Maybe because it has so much traffic, I don’t know. I don’t want to criticise the greens staff as the rest of the course is pristine. I just think it’s a shame the greens aren’t quite as good as they should be for a tournament of this size.”</p> \n<p>Justin Rose seemed equally unimpressed after his second-round 72. “I had a four-foot putt at the last and it looked easy on the TV, but that was different from the running commentary in my head,” said the former US Open champion.</p> \n<p>“You don’t trust your read on these greens and it becomes mental. It is disappointing in the sense that the whole reason they changed the greens on this course was that if anyone had a six-foot putt on the last green on Sunday to win they would feel confident about holing it. You now can’t say for sure that will happen as they are not super true.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432317671676/BMW-PGA-Championship-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rory McIlroy looks for his ball in a bush at Wentworth's PGA Championship during his second-round 78, his worst 18-hole score in almost a year.

On Wednesday <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/21/bath-george-ford-premiership-player-of-the-season\" title=\"\">Mike and George Ford became the first father and son combo to be voted coach and player of the season</a>; Saturday is about confirming that accolade. Should Bath beat Leicester and make their first Premiership grand final since 2004, it will be a mightily significant moment for both clubs.</p> \n<p>It would certainly be a painful reminder for the Tigers of what they lost when Ford Jr left Welford Road two years ago to relocate to the West Country. Since doing so the player has established himself as England’s first-choice fly-half, the baton-whirling ringmaster in the country’s most dazzling backline. The last time Leicester played at the Recreation Ground, in September, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/20/bath-leicester-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">they lost 45-0</a> and, by common consent, were lucky to get nil.</p> \n<p>So what will Bath do? They can be absolutely certain the Tigers will still be sore and come hard at them up front. Do they dig in accordingly and settle for an arm-wrestle or do they stay true to their instincts <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jan/18/bath-toulouse-european-rugby-champions-cup\" title=\"\">as they did in their similarly must-win European pool game against Toulouse back in January</a>? Enter the Ford family, whose tactical instincts have been consistently impressive so far.</p> \n<p>It can be a fine balance but both men firmly believe their team have developed into Martini winners: any time, any place, anywhere. “People say we play this expansive wide game but it you look at it carefully it all comes off the back of the forwards being dominant,” says the younger Ford. “We want to be a team that can win in a variety of ways. I think we’ve played some great attacking rugby but we’ve also had games when we’ve had to grind results out. We’re more than capable of doing that.”</p> \n<p>His father is even more convinced. “If there was to be a dogfight – a mauling, brawling game – I do think we can win it. It’s staggering the potential this team has got.”</p> \n<p>At the back of everyone’s minds, though, will be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/04/leinster-bath-champions-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">their Champions Cup quarter-final against Leinster</a>, when a frustratingly error-strewn first half left them too much to do late on. The memory of England’s Six Nations near miss is another reason why the 22-year-old fly-half is determined to nail down a title this time because, above all else, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2011/oct/24/thierry-dusautoir-irb-player-year\" title=\"\">former IRB world junior player of the year</a> craves collective trophies rather than individual gongs.</p> \n<p>“It’s the next step for us as a team, to win something. In your career you want to win trophies and enjoy special memories with your team-mates. It will mean everything to us but at the moment we’re not looking beyond Leicester. Play-off football is much more of a pressure game and Leicester have always been brilliant at it,” says Ford Jr.</p> \n<p>With Ed Slater back in the visiting back row and the Youngs brothers, Ben and Tom, in excellent form, nothing is remotely guaranteed. What the Tigers traditionally do best is prey on mental weakness and force tiny mistakes, at which point it matters little how artistic Bath are behind the scrum.</p> \n<p>“To win championships and trophies is a difficult thing,” acknowledges Ford, stressing the need for accuracy in thought and deed. “Every play counts. As we saw in the Six Nations with England we were close on points difference but there were instances in every game when, if we’d done one or two things a little better, we’d have probably ended up winning the title. It’s the same with the Premiership.”</p> \n<p>He will be quietly encouraged by the stats that suggest it is better to finish second in the Premiership table rather than top the regular-season ladder. Of the last dozen champions, only four finished first after 22 games. In 21 previous semi-finals, furthermore, there have been only four away victories, underlining the scale of the challenge facing the orange-clad Tigers, who are without Geoff Parling and Logovi’i Mulipola.</p> \n<p>Perhaps even more pertinently, the harder, faster pitches at this stage of the year suit Ford and friends more obviously than Leicester, who have not broken any try-scoring records this season. Ford is respectful of Freddie Burns’ ability to break open a game but he also has Kyle Eastmond and Jonathan Joseph at his elbow. Not since the days of Simon Halliday and Jeremy Guscott have Bath purred forwards so smoothly and the younger Ford is suitably thankful. “With the backline we’re got, you’ve just got to give them the ball in space and let them do what they do. To be part of that is massively enjoyable.”</p> \n<p>There is a reason, though, why Ford was named Aviva’s player of the year above all the others. For such a young man he has a veteran’s rugby brain and the hunger for more game time, which precipitated his exit from Welford Road, has been increasingly satisfied. “Playing week in, week out, has been massive for me as a fly-half. You’re constantly making decisions and that sharpens your instincts. That experience of managing games has helped me the most.”</p> \n<p>It is easy to forget Ford has already played in two Premiership finals, winning and losing one in the colours of Leicester. Coming off the bench in 2013 to replace Toby Flood he scored 12 points in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/may/25/leicester-northampton-premiership-final-dylan-hartley\" title=\"\">the 37-17 win over Northampton</a> and his regard for the Tigers’ mental strength remains with him. “They’re a very proud club and last September’s result would have hurt them. They’ll want to come back and get some sort of revenge on us.”</p> \n<p>He sounds right up for the challenge – “If you’re not feeling good for these kind of games you’re probably in the wrong business” – even at the end of the most physically demanding year of his life. A Bath versus Saracens final would also pit him against his old schoolboy mate Owen Farrell; how the two young sparring partners – and their fathers – would relish that opportunity.</p> \n<p>Then again there is also a definite glint in the eyes of Francois Louw and Sam Burgess, proven big-match players desperate for some Twickenham action. The Tigers may have made the play-offs for 11 successive years but their domestic aura is not quite what it was. These days it is increasingly about trying to overtake Team Ford.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/22/1432310493892/George-Ford-and-Bath-have-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"George Ford and Bath have received plaudits but he says: 'The next step for us as a team is to win something'.
