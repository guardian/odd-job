No longer.</p> \n<p>When Novak Djokovic pounded a cross-court winner past Roger Federer on Sunday afternoon to seal his third Wimbledon championship and ninth grand slam title, the four-way hegemony that has long defined the tour never appeared more like a spot in the rear view mirror. There is the Big One, and there is everyone else.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/12/federer-praises-djokovic-after-final-defeat\">Roger Federer generous in defeat by Novak Djokovic in Wimbledon final</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Djokovic had entered the showdown between the top two seeds with an 8-8 record in grand slam finals, lending it a pivotal feel with respect to his legacy despite an extraordinary run of form this season that included a 47-3 match record and five titles. He would have been the world No1 by more than 3,000 rankings points even if he had lost Sunday’s final, but the questions over his mental fortitude that have persisted through the years – never more than after last month’s shock defeat by Stan Wawrinka in the French Open final – would have redoubled.</p> \n<p>Instead Djokovic proved that when he is at his best, there is simply no stopping him. He crunched 46 winners and committed just 16 unforced errors, pounding groundstrokes with metronomic efficiency that pinned Federer to the worn-out baselines through exhausting rallies, punctuating points with winners into the corners and grace notes of deft net play.</p> \n<p>Federer’s only choice was to counter Djokovic’s artillery – weapons-grade forehand, stout defence, superior endurance in the baseline rallies – with variety. The seven-times Wimbledon champion tried it all – varying topspin and slice within the points, blending serve-and-volley with traditional baseline exchanges – with the improvisational flair of a chess grandmaster.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457476148__\n</div> \n<p>The sentimental favourite was never in question despite conditions that fluctuated wildly. The crowd rallied behind the Swiss when he fell behind in his service games and buzzed in anticipation when he staked even the slightest foothold in Djokovic’s. The roar of 15,000 fans exploded when he saved seven set points in a second-set tiebreaker to avoid going two sets down. When he was broken at 2-2 in the fourth set – a sequence that ultimately decided that match – a subdued hush fell over Centre Court as ominous as the grey sky above. Djokovic does not want to be the cowboy in the black hat, but he showed that he will if he must.</p> \n<p>“I expected that coming into the match,” Djokovic said. “I think it’s normal because Roger is a champion on and off the court. He’s a very likeable guy. He’s somebody that’s played on this level for so many years. Not judging by the results, but his character, his personality. He’s done all the right things to get that support. More or less anywhere I play against Roger it’s the same. I have to accept it, and I have to work to earn that support. One day.”</p> \n<p>Whatever doubts lingered over Djokovic’s nerve, it was Federer who looked anxious during the decisive games of the fourth set with a series of uncharacteristic errors while the world No1 rolled through his service games, at one point winning 11 straight points on his serve after holding from 30-0 down in the opening game. When Federer led 30-0 with Djokovic serving at 4-3, the champion piped in a pair of 121mph aces, then closed out the game with a service winner – and one hand on the trophy.</p> \n<p>Posterity may read it as the scalp of a lion in winter, Djokovic bagging a second straight Wimbledon title at the expense of a 33-year-old father of four. But make no mistake, this was vintage-era Federer: the balletic footwork, liquid-whip forehand, effortless serve all working in concert.</p> \n<p>While his stamina has fallen off marginally from his stratospheric peak – as an average first-serve speed that faded over the course of the match would suggest – the legitimate world No2 showed well in his record 10th final at the All England Club. Just not well enough to defeat an opponent who at the moment holds the entire tour in his thrall.</p> \n<p>At 28, Djokovic’s move from the fringe toward the forefront of the debate over who is the greatest ever seems only a matter of time. Who on the horizon stands in his way? Andy Murray, two major titles in hand, is no doubt a worthy rival. But he has won just eight of their 27 meetings, including losing eight in a row since the Scot’s epochal win in the 2013 Wimbledon final.</p> \n<p>Djokovic has performed just as well or better against the next wave – Grigor Dimitrov (five wins, one loss), Kei Nishikori (5-2), Milos Raonic (5-0) – and has yet to lose to the surprise US Open champion Marin Cilic in 13 attempts. Should he remain injury-free, there is no reason he cannot make a serious run at catching up all before him on the all-time major leaderboard: Federer (17), Rafael Nadal (14), Pete Sampras (14), Roy Emerson (12), Rod Laver (11), Bjorn Borg (11) and Bill Tilden (10).</p> \n<p>“I’m 28,” he said. “I feel good.

The bowling was wayward, Brad Haddin was being forced to fling his ageing body this way and that, fielders were chugging after the ball and the captain started to look bereft of ideas. They looked diminished in stature, the mystique gone. In The Wizard of Oz, Dorothy discovers that the wizard is in fact nothing more than a middle-aged man. It might stand as a metaphor for these wizards in the first game.</p> \n<p>Whatever happens from here England – brain, heart and courage intact – know there is nothing to fear. Australia have won one match, at Headingley in 2009, and lost eight of their past 15 in England and Wales. Cricket Australia’s immediate response was to put its fingers in its ears, go ‘nah nah nah’ and announce the dates of this year’s Big Bash in time for its morning bulletins.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457473252__\n</div> \n<p>Australia were outplayed in every department of the game. They attempted to match the panache of Root, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali with the bat but foundered against skilled bowling that adhered rigidly to a game plan for each batsman – across the dangerous David Warner, fifth stump to Steve Smith and Michael Clarke, inevitably straight to Shane Watson, all to a length that encouraged the drive but made it a real risk-reward shot. Australia’s bowling was wholehearted but could not come to terms with the conditions or the Duke ball (which incidentally they had been using in the West Indies prior to coming to England).</p> \n<p>In the field England were athletic and sharp, the single chance missed that from Chris Rogers by Root on the final morning. There was a willingness to stand closer on a slower pitch, something that they had not done in West Indies or against New Zealand. During their pre-series Spanish get-together, the team had practised nothing but fielding, which has always been a focal point of the Trevor Bayliss creed, and it showed.</p> \n<p>Australia, too, held some excellent catches but they were also pedestrian at times, age showing its hand. Haddin’s dropping of Root before he had scored in the first innings will be right up there with Shane Warne missing Kevin Pietersen at The Oval in 2005, Michael Carberry dropping Haddin in Adelaide two winters ago and Ashley Giles dropping Ricky Ponting on the same ground in 2006-07 in the litany of expensive missed Ashes chances.</p> \n<p>Most telling of all was the manner in which Clarke was out-captained by Alastair Cook. It is, as Cook readily admits, pretty easy to captain a group of bowlers who know their roles to perfection and perform beautifully: they know what they want and the captain responds to that. But knowing when to ring the changes is something else altogether. Cook was proactive and obviously in charge, which has not always been the case. The decision to bowl Stuart Broad on the third morning, for example, despite the proximity of the second new ball would have been a combined management decision but not the instinct that gave Moeen the last over before lunch on the final day in which he claimed Warner’s wicket and kick-started the Australian slide to defeat. Clarke’s bowlers let him down but he appeared to do little to lift them and towards the end of the second England innings looked devoid of ideas, standing aloof, arms folded. With his form a worry along with his back he was exposed as much as anyone in this match.</p> \n<p>There is precious little time for Australia to regroup, with the second Test starting at Lord’s on Thursday, and they will find England no more accommodating than they were at Cardiff. The idea that visiting teams gain more inspiration from playing at the ground than England do is risible, a myth. Indeed England’s record there since Australia won the first Test of the 2005 series shows that of 19 matches they have lost only to South Africa and, last year, India with nine of the past 13 games won.</p> \n<p>Unsurprisingly England have named the same squad of 13 players and will no doubt play the same XI, the only debate being perhaps whether Ian Bell and Gary Ballance might swap places in the order if only to break up the sequence of left-handers.</p> \n<p>For Australia questions abound. Before the series started it looked, as with England in Australia last time, that they were trying to squeeze one last series out of a flagging unit. Already Ryan Harris has gone and there are concerns about Watson and Haddin. There also remains a question mark over the fitness of Mitchell Starc, although they seem confident enough that his ankle problem will improve sufficiently in time for the match. A guess would be that Mitchell Marsh will replace Watson, whose value as an all-rounder is diminished if he does not bowl more than a few overs, but that Haddin will retain his place for now. Yet making changes would be an early and uncharacteristic admission that they got things wrong.</p> \n<p>There is work to do for the Australian bowlers, however. Although rather too much is made of it, Lord’s is still a demanding place to bowl, with its vagaries of slope and consequent geometry. Some of the bowling angles will not come naturally to those who have not experienced it and for some reason left-armers appear to have more trouble than their counterparts although there is no obvious reason why this should be. None of Starc, Josh Hazlewood or the spinner Nathan Lyon has played at Lord’s. On the other hand Mitchell Johnson has and it has not been pretty, with four wickets in two Tests, against England in 2009 and Pakistan the following year, for an average of 76 and an economy rate of almost five runs per over. He has sharpened up his technique since those days but the thought will still linger, particularly after a modest first Test in Cardiff.

It was rounded up from 0.62sec, BMC’s actual margin of victory over the 28km course. Ouch.</p> \n<p>“Personally, it’s quite difficult for me,” said Roche. “This was a massive opportunity for me for a stage win. Over the last few Tours I’ve been riding as a <em>domestique </em>and winning a TTT is something very particular, something you work at. There’s no luck, it’s all about sticking together and being there. It’s something that I really dreamed of, so it’s a bit of a tough one. But looking at the bigger picture, Froomey is in top shape, we kept the jersey, we’re in contention and we’re really ready to be in the mountains now.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2015/jul/12/tour-de-france-stages-eight-and-nine-in-pictures\">Tour de France, stages eight and nine – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Having put down a significant marker in last month’s Crit&eacute;rium du Dauphin&eacute; the BMC team of Tejay van Garderen were again triumphant on a day when they had made no secret of their hopes of getting their leader into the <em>maillot jaune</em>. It was not to be: on the race’s first rest day Froome remains 12 seconds clear of the American. Crucially Froome also put further time into his fellow Fab Four members Vincenzo Nibali, Alberto Contador and Nairo Quintana.</p> \n<p>“Those guys have that tag, the Fab Four, which is getting a little irritating hearing that,” said Van Garderen, the disgruntled fifth Beatle.</p> \n<p>“I’m not offended not to be named in that. All those guys in the Fab Four have won Grand Tours. I’ve had a couple of good top fives in the Tour but I’m yet to finish on the podium or win one.”</p> \n<p>Team time trials are usually held on stage four or five of Grand Tours; UCI rules decree they “shall take place during the first third of the race” in order to give teams as fair a chance as possible of fielding a full-strength line-up in a discipline where the time of the fifth man to cross the finishing line is the one recorded.</p> \n<p>Including rest days this year’s Tour de France is already nine days into a total of 23, on the ninth stage of 21 in an event where 40% of the total distance has already been completed. No matter which way you look at it this was a clear case of world cycling’s governing body ignoring its own guidelines.</p> \n<p>Orica GreenEdge suffered most from the anomalous scheduling having lost Michael Albasini, Simon Gerrans and Daryl Impey to injury in the opening week while their Tour debutant, Michael Matthews, struggles on with damaged ribs that continue to restrict his ability to breathe. He was nursed through this stage by his remaining team-mates without having to do a tow in front.</p> \n<p>Truth be told, the Australian team had no complaints about misfortune for which little or no legislation could realistically have been made. They lost a third of their team to a crash that took place on stage three and treated a time trial they originally had high hopes of winning like a Sunday afternoon countryside spin, finishing just shy of five minutes behind the winners.</p> \n<p>Of the big-budget big-hitters Nibali’s Astana team were first out and set an early clubhouse lead of 32min 30sec that was quickly beaten by Quintana’s Movistar outfit, who finished 11 seconds faster. All eyes promptly turned to Tinkoff Saxo, BMC and Sky, the teams of Contador,&nbsp;Van Garderen and Froome respectively, who were last out on the road in that order.</p> \n<p>On a course that finished with a tough climb up the 1.7km C&ocirc;te de Cadoudal, Contador came off worst of the trio; his Tinkoff-Saxo team finished 28 seconds behind the eventual winners. BMC posted a time of 32min 15sec, which Sky only just failed to match.</p> \n<p>With Froome, Geraint Thomas, Leopold K&ouml;nig, Richie Porte, Wouter Poels and Roche tasked with closing out the stage after Peter Kennaugh, Ian Stannard and Luke Rowe had exhausted themselves on the flat, Poels hoisted the white flag at the bottom of the ascent and, of the remaining quintet, Roche was found ever so slightly wanting in the closing metres.</p> \n<p>“We really can’t be too disappointed with that,” said Froome. “For everyone’s morale it would’ve been fantastic to have been able to get the stage win today, but more importantly we’ve kept the yellow jersey, we’ve put time into most of our rivals. We’ve got to be happy with that.</p> \n<p>“It’s one thing not to lose any time to your rivals, but to actually gain quite substantial amounts on quite a lot of contenders – it’s put us in a fantastic position. Some other rivals – Nibali, Quintana – they’ve both lost quite a substantial amount of time already so the pressure’s definitely on them to attack once we go into the mountains,” said Froome. “It’s for the other guys to get the yellow jersey from me now.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/21114be05d50d2a25618e68b408069048bf63be4/0_0_2200_1320/2200.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1320,"width":2200,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Riders of the Great Britain's Sky cycling team, including Great Britain's Christopher Froome (L), wearing the overall leader's yellow jersey, compete in the 28 km team time-trial, the ninth stage of the 102nd edition of the Tour de France cycling race on July 12, 2015, between Vannes and Plumelec, western France.

Wolfsburg’s Kevin de Bruyne is apparently the club’s fallback option. “Yes, I like him [Di Mar&iacute;a] very much,” he said. “But at our level, trying to improve your team, you are competing for players who belong to big clubs. And, even if one club has more money, you are not competing alone in the market.</p> \n<p>“We have more freedom [in the market] but it remains a difficult one for us to do because we’re not alone in wanting him. The competition is very, very tough. Don’t forget Manchester United paid a fortune to sign him. The decision to relax FFP regulations was favourable to PSG but it happened late in the day. Now it has, new avenues are open to us for recruitment. We fell behind but we’ll catch up.”</p> \n<p>Contact is expected to be made with Jorge Mendes, the Argentina forward’s agent, and PSG had hoped to offer wages of nearer &pound;130,000 a week after tax. A compromise is likely to be attainable.</p> \n<p>Di Mar&iacute;a, who was injured early in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/chile-argentina-copa-america-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the final of the Copa Am&eacute;rica</a>, would follow Robin van Persie in leaving Old Trafford; the Dutch international is in Istanbul for a medical before the completion of a transfer to Fenerbahce. The 31-year-old has been offered a three-year contract worth around &pound;240,000 a week to end his three-season association with United following a &pound;24m switch from Arsenal in 2012.</p> \n<p>There is optimism at United that Schweinsteiger’s eye-catching arrival from Bayern Munich can still be followed by the signing of Morgan Schneiderlin of Southampton as Louis van Gaal continues to reshape his squad this summer. An initial bid of &pound;20m was rejected, falling at least &pound;7m short of the south-coast club’s valuation, but the Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, has admitted he is planning for life without the France international.</p> \n<p>Schweinsteiger flew to Manchester on Sunday to undertake a medical and sign a three-year contract after bidding farewell to Bayern’s fans in a statement and video posted on Twitter. “The decision was very hard to make because you and FCB have and always will be an extremely important part of my life,” said the 30-year-old, who won eight Bundesliga titles, seven German Cups and the Champions League in a 17-year career in Bavaria. “Nevertheless, I would like to again gain experience at a new club. My destination is Manchester United. I hope you understand my decision. No one can take away the incredible journey we had together.”</p> \n<p>The midfielder will cost in the region of &pound;15m following on from the arrival of Matteo Darmian from Torino and the &pound;21.5m addition of Depay from PSV Eindhoven earlier in the summer. Schweinsteiger is expected to play some part in United’s pre-season tour of the United States, on which they depart on Monday.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436729746227/-ngel-Di-Mar-a-Manchester-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ángel Di María suffered a difficult first season at Manchester United after his record move from Real Madrid.
