It’s a big night for boxing.</p> \n<p>It’s also a big night for HBO and Showtime, who are jointly producing the pay-per-view television event. At $89.95 (&pound;59) — and 10 dollars more for HD — the fight is the most expensive pay-per-view of all time, smashing the previous high of $74.95. Previous Mayweather and Pacquiao fights have generally been closer to $70.</p> \n<p>The two boxers are expected to divide around $300m. Lots of money will be made on Saturday night by the promoters, the ticket brokers, the Vegas hotels, the PPV operators, the cable companies etc. But another group will be making money on Saturday night, too – the pay-per-view cops.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/27/floyd-mayweather-manny-pacquiao\">Mayweather-Pacquiao: why I cannot bring myself to watch boxing’s fight of the century | Melissa Jacobs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>On the night of the big fight, the PPV cops – who are not real police, though one company says many former law-enforcement officers are in their ranks – will attempt to find bars showing the fight without having paid licensing fees. If they help promoters nail establishments that have not paid, the companies say they can make hundreds or even thousands of dollars.</p> \n<p>A bar cannot just order the $100 pay-per-view and show it on its televisions; it needs a licence to show the fight in public. G&amp;G Boxing — the company selling the rights to show Saturday’s fight — reports the cost of the event “is determined by the occupancy of your establishment among other factors”. ESPN’s Darren Rovell reported the cost for this bout is $25 times the fire code occupancy of the location.</p> \n<p>It varies. Bar owners and managers report numbers around that. A bar manager in Wilmington, Delaware, says his place was quoted $5,000 for a 257-seat occupancy (about $20 a head). Cardrooms in California have been quoted as high as $50 a head. A Buffalo Wild Wings in Henderson, Nevada, was quoted $4,500 to show the fight.</p> \n<p>You have to sell a lot of food and beer to cover such a high cost. It’s no wonder many bars are opting out of showing the fight, despite the amount of interest. KTNV-TV of Las Vegas talked to quite a few sports bars that have declined to show the fight; it simply wasn’t worth it to them.</p> \n<p>Bars, of course, have a murkier option: they can show the fight illegally. The owner of a bar in south-eastern Pennsylvania, who asked for “anonymity and vagueness of his location” so he could talk, says he is closing down the bar on Saturday night rather than spend the money to order the fight. Obviously that’s not his real plan: “We’re going to have our regulars in and we’re all going to watch the fight.” The owner had not even bothered to check with G&amp;G to see what it would cost, as “he knew he couldn’t afford it”. He says he wants to give his regular customers what they want, but he says he cannot do it above-board. He says he has done this before – but only for WWE wrestling.</p> \n<p>But our bar owner could be in trouble if he has more than just his regulars in. G&amp;G says it attempts to combat piracy – threatening those showing the fight without paying the licensing fee – with “civil liability for actual and statutory damages in excess of $100,000, injunctive relief, legal costs and attorneys’ fees, as well as other severe criminal and civil penalties as provided for by federal copyright and state and federal telecommunications laws”.</p> \n<p>Companies take this seriously. G&amp;G even has a bilingual line where interested parties can report PPV piracy. Sometimes bar owners make it easy by advertising the fight on social media or on fliers. But others go into deep cover to show big fights. That’s where the PPV cops come in.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-dda705f8-7cd2-4f59-bab9-13f973e0b3cf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430218685293/e1ea1ff6-0639-4f90-872e-7aade489d442-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"An billboard advertising Floyd Mayweather vs Manny Pacquiao is installed at the MGM Grand\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A large billboard advertising Saturday’s fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao is installed at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Locher/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The company Audit Masters did not respond to requests for comment. But it did advertise on Craigslist in February for auditors for the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. On Monday, Edlund Data Services — a company that specialises in recruiting mystery shoppers — posted an advert looking for PPV cops for Saturday’s event.</p> \n<p>People contracted by Audit Masters get a list of bars legally showing a PPV. During the four-hour telecast, PPV cops travel around to locations that are showing the fight but not on their list.</p> \n<p>“We do not tell you where to go,” Audit Masters says on its website. “That is up to you, we leave that up to your local expertise as to where you feel the most productive areas for piracy would be. We do ask that you average at least five stops per hour during the hours of the telecast.”</p> \n<p>The company – Audit Masters or another firm – then has its “police” give affidavits about what they saw. These can get incredibly detailed, as one lawsuit stemming from a 2009 Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) pay-per-view broadcast of a fight between Georges St-Pierre and BJ Penn showed. This suit was filed by Joe Hand Promotions, a Pennsylvania–based promoter. “Network showed replays of Pierre’s left jabs and spoke of how effective they were,” Jerauld Peacock said in the affidavit, after previously reporting he had entered a Virginia bar and ordered a drink. “Upon the decision, Pierre did his trademark back flip, over rotating, doing a backwards roll and springing to his feet.”</p> \n<p>Audit Masters’ testimonial page quotes a J Mallow from Miami Dade Law Enforcement: “The first time I went out, I caught seven pirates. When Dee calls with a gig I am always ready to go, I know two things are going to happen: 1. I am going to bust some bars engaged in illegal activity 2. I am going to make some decent money for the night … I also get personal satisfaction from the fact that some of these bars will be closing and when a bar that was a detriment to the community is closed, the community as a whole is better off, to me, as a law-enforcement officer, it is a win, win situation.”</p> \n<p>PPV cops are paid by the number of illegal locations they are able to find. The ad posted by Edlund offers $250 per location found.</p> \n<p>Part of this is bluster: companies want to scare bars into paying fees in advance. But if a bar is caught showing a fight without paying, there can be significant consequences. A bar in Lake Elsinore, California, shut down after paying a $23,000 fine for illegally showing a Mayweather fight. J&amp;J Sports Promotions, which licenses fights and has partnered with G&amp;G, has also filed more than 1,600 lawsuits against businesses illegally showing PPV events since 2010. In 2009 it won a $112,800 default judgment against a bar in Arkansas. It settled for $50,000 with a bar that showed the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJd_Fc_9m20\" title=\"\">Mayweather-Victor Ortiz fight in 2011</a>. “I’m not in business to sue people,” the J&amp;J president Joseph Gagliardi told the Los Angeles Times. “But I’ve got to do it for one reason: to protect the clientele who are doing it right.”</p> \n<p>It is not limited to boxing. The UFC has sued several bars that showed PPV events without paying. Four years ago the UFC sued one Nebraska bar for $260,000. Another lawsuit in 2010 asked for $640,000. Joe Hand, which has distributed the UFC since 2001, lists several victories against bars on its website. It has won between $6,325 and $80,000 after suing bars that illegally showed UFC cards. In the 2009 St Pierre-Penn fight, where the backflip was described in a court filing, Joe Hand settled for $2,400.</p> \n<p>Audit Masters says Saturday’s fight will be “the most pirated event ever … and without question this will be the absolute most worthwhile, beneficial lucrative, productive, successful, and profitable event ever worked by our auditors. It will be without a doubt the biggest moneymaker ever”. For bars caught showing the fight without paying, it will be anything but.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430215974255/An-billboard-advertising--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A large billboard advertising Saturday's fight between Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao is installed at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.

The <a href=\"http://www.thepfa.com/thepfa/pfaawards/championship-pfa-team-of-the-year-2015\">Championship Team of the Year</a> had one very notable omission in Patrick Bamford, who had been named the player of the season by the Football League just a week earlier. The Middlesbrough forward, on loan from Chelsea, was one of a number of young players who shone in the campaign. To give a greater idea of players who may interest Premier League clubs this summer we’ve avoided the two promoted sides as well as players, such as Bamford, who were on loan from top-flight clubs.</p> \n<h2>Lewis Dunk, 23, Brighton</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5c0e76c0cfc03e8ff0237c80f9576c7dff1d6540\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430229098857/291ad4d1-4df6-48c4-97d0-a3f579b64de2-460x322.jpeg\" alt=\"Lewis Dunk\" width=\"460\" height=\"322\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lewis Dunk holds off Mesut &Ouml;zil as Brighton play Arsenal.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The highest-rated player under the age of 24 <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Players/86441\">according to our ratings this season</a> (7.45), the Brighton centre-back has become an integral player to the Seagulls. He made just seven league appearances for the club last season and was on a one-month loan to Bristol City during the campaign, but has been a mainstay this season, starting 37 matches. </p> \n<p>The 23-year-old’s lofty frame means that he is commanding in the air, winning 139 of 212 aerial duels as well as mustering 29 headed attempts at goal. That aerial threat has heralded five goals from set pieces, with only two players managing more. Only Ipswich’s Cole Skuse has made more interceptions this season than Dunk’s 129. That only the current top six and Sheffield Wednesday have a better defensive record than Brighton (54 goals conceded) has been in no small part due to the youngster’s presence at the back.</p> \n<h2>James Tarkowski, 22, Brentford</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2eede6fa8b3de438cefe2b7a0f5e4c992d44a721\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430229475465/84550c42-3ae8-423f-9d99-9a62a9da1c6e-460x291.jpeg\" alt=\"James Tarkowski\" width=\"460\" height=\"291\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Tarkowski playing for Oldham in 2013.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Brentford’s James Tarkowski is another centre-back who has played with maturity beyond his years for much of the season. Him and his defensive partner, Harlee Dean, are highly thought of by the Bees. Tarkowski, at just 22 years of age, is generally considered to have the greater potential of the two, edging out his team-mate with <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Players/131464\">a rating of 7.43</a>. Tarkowski is the more cultured of the pair and in turn may well attract interest from the top-tier, with Brentford looking likely to miss out on a play-off place.</p> \n<p>Tarkowski has a solid pass accuracy as far as Championship defenders are concerned (79.7%) and combines his composure on the ball with impressive defensive figures including 2 tackles, 2.6 interceptions and 8.6 clearances per game. His average of 1.3 shot-blocks per game is bettered only by Wolves’ Richard Stearman. He could improve his concentration, with no outfielder committing more errors leading to a shot (six) this season.</p> \n<h2>Benik Afobe, 22, Wolverhampton Wanderers</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3e4e73ff8983d912ff54756bfbf425bd5a6ed24\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430230137507/6e148ccb-7bd0-4fd7-8b31-b1323a029eac-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Benik Afobe\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benik Afobe celebrates scoring their for Wolves against Wigan.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Sykes/Action Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Benik Afobe may have tempted a number of Premier League clubs in January before he eventually sealed a permanent move from Arsenal to Wolves. He’s a striker in self-proclaimed “unstoppable” form this season, notching 32 goals in all competitions, including a successful loan spell with MK Dons prior to his winter window switch.</p> \n<p>With 13 league goals and four assists in 20 Championship appearances, the 22-year-old has hit the ground running. His ability to make the transition from League One with ease will have impressed clubs further up the pecking order. The forward has picked up impressive averages of 2.2 shots – at a superb 29.5% conversion rate – and 1.6 dribbles per game to earn <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Players/93647\">a rating of 7.42</a>.<br /></p> \n<h2>Tyrone Mings, 22, Ipswich Town</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0002e05ee366589bab9337e859d76fe7f013e8c6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430230296337/b719c7e9-fdcd-4d4a-9056-8a6104fd33e5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tyrone Mings\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tyrone Mings playing for Ipswich Town against Norwich City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Mills/Action Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Having already been linked with a Premier League switch after impressive performances this season, Tyrone Mings will still be harbouring hopes of reaching the promised land with fifth-place Ipswich Town. If that doesn’t happen, he could still follow in the footsteps of Aaron Cresswell, who he replaced successfully at left-back at Portman Road. Impressive averages of 2.7 interceptions and 2.2 tackles per game are supplemented by a strong attacking output, including 1.4 key passes and 1.2 dribbles per game for <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Players/123167/Show/Tyrone-Mings\">a rating of 7.25</a>. <br /></p> \n<h2>Nathan Redmond, 21, Norwich City</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e3801189e056308073db22f9a73954652f93416d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430230460738/26391986-6180-40e4-a5b4-714d8b7a12bc-460x260.jpeg\" alt=\"Redmond\" width=\"460\" height=\"260\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nathan Redmond playing for Norwich City.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Cameron/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>His season is not over just yet, with Norwich assured of a play-off place, but if the Canaries fail at the first attempt of a return to the top-flight Nathan Redmond may be in high demand. Set to play a key role for England at the European U21 Championship this summer, the winger has added an end product to his game this season, having shown flashes of potential in the Premier League last season. Redmond has 10 assists and ranks highly for both chances created (102 – fourth) and dribbles completed (98 – third), contributing to <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Players/86425\">a rating of 7.22</a>.</p> \n<h2>Lasse Vigen Christensen, 20, Fulham</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3904e53f78e4fcd5e57a8b1b445cea0039712c32\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430231256670/7d82b0cd-9856-45bc-9282-c48c8d5ca11b-460x332.jpeg\" alt=\"Lasse Vigen Christensen\" width=\"460\" height=\"332\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lasse Vigen Christensen chases Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain during the U21 League Cup match between Fulham and Arsenal in 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Price/Arsenal FC via Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another player hoping to impress in the Czech Republic this summer, doing so with Denmark U21s, is Fulham’s Lasse Vigen Christensen, who has been the most impressive of the club’s renowned youth products this season. In what has been a pretty dismal campaign for Fulham, Christensen has been a bright spark, contributing five goals and seven assists in just 25 appearances for <a href=\"http://www.whoscored.com/Players/141004\">a rating of 7.20</a>.

This week marks the 20th showpiece final in European club rugby’s eventful history and, inevitably, there will be those pining for the good old days when Munster, Leinster, Wasps, Leicester or Toulouse were the continent’s undisputed kings. Even if Toulon become the first side to win three successive titles, not everyone will hail them as the best of all time.</p> \n<p>So, as a Twickenham aperitif, let’s try and broaden that argument by choosing the best XV to have graced the tournament in the past 20 seasons. The criteria are simple: an individual must have made a significant tournament impact and featured in at least one European Cup final. Already that excludes some fine Test Lions – Jason Robinson, Stephen Jones, Jamie Roberts, Alun Wyn Jones – but rules is rules.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/apr/27/brock-james-european-cup-french-dominate\">Brock James: French teams will not continue to dominate European Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Some positions are almost impossible to sift. How can you reject such distinguished modern fly-halves as Jones, Ronan O’Gara, Jonny Wilkinson, Felipe Contepomi, David Humphreys, Alex King and Diego Dom&iacute;nguez without feeling genuine pangs of guilt. At No8, too – before people storm the Guardian offices en masse – it is only fair to mention that Lawrence Dallaglio, Pat Lam, Jamie Heaslip, Imanol Harinordoquy and Shaun Sowerby, among others, were seriously unlucky.</p> \n<p>In the end, though, desperately hard decisions could be swerved no longer. Not only did Anthony Foley captain Munster to their famous first Heineken triumph in Cardiff but no forward in the history of the tournament has scored more than his 23 tries. Wilkinson may have featured in two winning European finals but Jonny Sexton managed three in four years with Leinster.</p> \n<p>Looking down the final list, the Irish provinces are decently represented, which is hardly a surprise given Munster and Leinster’s history in the old Heineken Cup. You could hardly leave out Brian O’Driscoll or Paul O’Connell, could you? At least O’Gara makes the bench, which is something. His tally of 1,365 points in the tournament is so far out in front it may never be beaten.</p> \n<p>The contentious calls? Given the quality of modern back-row forwards, never mind over the past two decades, not everyone will concur with the choices of Rocky Elsom and David Wallace on the flanks. The nay-sayers are forgetting how absurdly dominant Elsom was during Leinster’s title-winning campaign of 2008-09 and underestimate Wallace’s achievement, along with O’Gara and John Hayes, in playing in four Heineken finals. Even Neil Back, Thierry Dusautoir, Sean O’Brien, Steffon Armitage, Julien Bonnaire, Juan Smith and Brive’s fine Polish international Gregory Kacala cannot claim that.</p> \n<p>Not many, either, have won European Cups playing in two different positions for two different clubs, as Philippe Carbonneau did. As the scrum-half kingpin for the great Brive side who smashed Leicester in 1997 he was irresistible, having been picked at outside-centre for Toulouse the previous year. Austin Healey, who reserved some of his best rugby for Europe, deserves a mention in this category while Ulster’s high-class Ruan Pienaar is another Rolls-Royce utility player.</p> \n<p>It is even more awkward to survey a team-sheet lacking finishers of the calibre of Emile Ntamack, Ieuan Evans and C&eacute;dric Heymans (six times a finalist – a record), never mind Napolioni Nalaga, Tommy Bowe and the prolific Chris Ashton. In the end, though, there has to be a place on the left wing for Vincent Clerc, the tournament’s all-time highest try-scorer, and even Nalaga never created quite as much panic in opposition ranks as the former All Black Sitiveni Sivivatu during Clermont’s run to the 2013 final.</p> \n<p>For all the qualities of Cl&eacute;ment Poitrenaud, Isa Nacewa and Nicolas Brusque, too, Geordan Murphy’s all-round footballing skills just earn him a jersey, with the outstanding Matt Giteau completing the backline. Up front Trevor Leota may not have been the world’s slimmest hooker, but as a wrecking ball he was monumental. Put Joe Schmidt in charge of strategy and this bunch would take an awful lot of beating.</p> \n<p><strong>Ultimate Euro XV</strong> Geordan Murphy (Leicester); Sitiveni Sivivatu (Clermont Auvergne), Brian O’Driscoll (Leinster), Matt Giteau (Toulon), Vincent Clerc (Toulouse); Jonathan Sexton (Leinster/Racing M&eacute;tro), Philippe Carbonneau (Toulouse/Brive); Cian Healy (Leinster), Trevor Leota (Wasps), Carl Hayman (Toulon), Martin Johnson (Leicester), Paul O’Connell (Munster), Rocky Elsom (Leinster), David Wallace (Munster), Anthony Foley (Munster).</p> \n<p><strong>Replacements</strong> Rapha&euml;l Iba&ntilde;ez (Wasps), Graham Rowntree (Leicester), John Hayes (Munster), Simon Shaw (Wasps), Juan Martin Fern&aacute;ndez-Lobbe (Toulon), Ruan Pienaar (Ulster), Ronan O’Gara (Munster), Wesley Fofana (Clermont Auvergne).</p> \n<h2>Hand of fate</h2> \n<p>It is hard to remember a season in which rugby players have been cautioned so regularly for the most hairline of “offences”. There was another good example on Sunday when Thomas Waldrom was yellow-carded for a supposed deliberate slap-down of a Wasps pass as he went for an interception. Had he gathered the rebound – which he nearly did – he would have been fine; it has hard to spot any conclusive evidence he was not trying to gather the ball. Nevertheless the No8 spent 10 minutes in the sin-bin during which time Exeter conceded a crucial try which ultimately cost them the game. If it becomes a crime for a rugby player with good reflexes to try to catch a ball thrown by an opponent, the sport will be the poorer for it.</p> \n<h2>One to watch</h2> \n<p>Clermont Auvergne v Toulon. European titles do not always go to the most dazzling attacking teams. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/may/18/jonny-wilkinson-toulon-clermont-heineken-cup\" title=\"\">As Toulon proved two years ago</a>, it is more about keeping cool heads and hoping others lose theirs. If the champions are to become the first team to win three successive European crowns, however, they will require something out of the ordinary. Clermont are comfortably the best side never to have conquered Europe and should really have won in Dublin in 2013 before Jonny Wilkinson and Delon Armitage intervened. They did not much enjoy their last Twickenham visit a year ago, when Saracens took them apart, but it could be a different story this time.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430219541759/Martin-Johnson-celebrates-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Leicester's Martin Johnson is in the best XV, having been part of the Tigers' Heineken Cup winning sides of 2001 and 2002.

England, at the Bourda in Georgetown, 17 March 1994. West Indies were then still the No1 team in the world, and to stay so for another 12 months, till their watershed loss to Australia the following spring. Opening the batting, Desmond Haynes, playing in his 113th Test, and Richie Richardson, in his 74th. Opening the bowling, Curtly Ambrose and Courtney Walsh. Alongside the young Chanderpaul in the middle order, Brian Lara – soon to break Garry Sobers’ record Test score – and Jimmy Adams, early in the purple patch of form that saw him average 70 in his first 20 Tests. Another era altogether then, one when the West Indies, while waning, still played with some of the fire and brilliance that had made them one of the greatest teams in history.</p> \n<p>Chanderpaul was 19, and so slim that both his shirt and pads seemed several sizes too big for him. He was called in as a replacement for Phil Simmons, now West Indies’ head coach. Some said he was only there to please the Guyanese. “A politically shrewd selection,” wrote Derek Pringle in The Independent. Wisden, in one of those odd and endearing miscalculations it occasionally makes, reported that he was included “as much for his leg-breaks as his left-handed batting”. And he did bowl 16 overs, all wicketless, in the first innings. Things became clearer when, in at No6, he hit his first four, a glorious cut behind point off Alan Igglesden. That afternoon Chanderpaul battered England’s attack, and scored the first of his 66 Test 50s. There was a pitch invasion when he got there, and Adams had to drag away a couple of fans who wanted to grab the boy’s bat.</p> \n<p>After his last Test century – 101 against Bangladesh in St Lucia last September – Chanderpaul needed to score 228 runs to overtake Lara as the West Indies’ leading run-scorer in Test cricket. Now, he still needs another 71 to do it. His progress towards the record has been slow and faltering, 91 runs in six innings against South Africa, 67 in four so far against England. At his age, even a short run of low scores is enough to make people wonder whether his time is finally up. His next Test will be his 164th, and put him fifth on the all-time list alongside Rahul Dravid. Sachin Tendulkar is the only man who has made it beyond the 160s. For West Indies, Australia are next up. It seems like these could be some the final few scenes of Chanderpaul’s career.</p> \n<p>Chanderpaul is 40 now, and has spent the last two years playing alongside his own son, Tagenarine, for Guyana. <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/blogs/content/story/622036.html\">At the end of 2012 they put on 256 runs together</a> – 143 for the father, 112 for the son – in a club match against the Transport Sports Club. Delightfully amateur, that. Tagenarine is another left-hander and, like his old man, he often uses his bat to knock a bail into the ground to mark his guard. He too grew up playing on the hard earth of Unity Village, he too was coached by Khemraj Chanderpaul, Shiv’s father, Tagenarine’s grandfather. He did have the advantage, however, of being able to play on a relaid pitch, by a rebuilt pavilion. His father paid for the upgrades, a gift to his village. When Shiv was a boy, he played on a strip on the side of the village pitch so that he could practice without disturbing the senior players. Then, at night, he would bat against a ball tucked into a sock, hanging from a rope tied to the roof.</p> \n<p>With Shiv, the story has always been that he was shaped by those early years in Unity. A small kid with scrappy kit, playing on rough wickets against tough men. He evolved that home-spun style all of his own; the open, awkward stance, chest half-turned to the bowler, playing late often as not, looking to slide the ball behind square. The first time he did it in a Test, to take a four off Angus Fraser, Geoff Boycott was commentating. “That’s exactly why England should be bowling as much as possible at the youngster, Chanderpaul … he never really got forward, he fell into the shot.”</p> \n<p>Chanderpaul was shaped, too, by the circumstances of his career, which has exactly overlapped with the decline and fall of the team. Lara’s did too, of course, but he was so richly blessed that he always seemed almost to rise above his team-mates, a man apart. Whereas Shiv seems to have spent his talent propping them up. Lara went in 2006. Walsh in 2001, Ambrose in 2000, Richardson in 1995, Haynes in 1994. Shiv has played with almost 100 others since he made his debut. And even the best of them – Chris Gayle and Ramnaresh Sarwan – have now come and gone. Others were hardly there at all. A full 42 of them played in only five Tests or fewer.</p> \n<p>Back in 2003, in another home Test at the Bourda, against Australia this time, Chanderpaul played one of the great counterattacking innings. West Indies had won the toss, and chosen to bat. An hour before lunch, they were 53 for five. An hour after it, 184 for six. In between, Chanderpaul cut, pulled, and drove a hundred off 69 balls, then third-fastest century Test ever scored. A little glimpse of his latent attacking talent, a hint of the batsman he might have been if he had been playing in a different era, or for another team. His last hundred, the one against Bangladesh at the Beausejour, took 138 balls, and was the fastest he has scored since. In between the two, he turned himself into one of the most cussed batsmen ever to play the game, a man who measured his innings out in hours and days, rather than runs and balls.</p> \n<p>Chanderpaul turned himself into the great rearguard batsman, a man who never quits and never surrenders. Unsurprisingly, he has been not out more often than any other batsman in history. Some have said he is dull, others that he is selfish. But he has only been doing what he has to. He has, for instance, been involved in more run-outs than anyone in Test cricket, 25 altogether. And on 21 of those occasions, it’s been his partner who has had to walk off. No wonder. Chanderpaul has had to play that way, fuelled by the Boycott-like certainty that West Indies’ best chance is if he is at the wicket. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/apr/17/the-spin-west-indies-shivnarine-chanderpaul\">He has scored more runs in lost matches than any other batsman</a>.</p> \n<p>The final years of Chanderpaul’s career have too often been characterised by what Wisden called the “yawning gap between his skill, commitment and experience” and that of his team-mates. After Lara quit, Chanderpaul took on the load. He’s been carrying it ever since, always unbowed, often undefeated. If – or rather when – he gets those final few runs and overtakes his old team-mate, it will be odd to see him there, top of the record lists, above the likes of Lara, Viv Richards, and Garry Sobers. But after all he has done, no one would begrudge him his place. </p> \n<h2><p><strong><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> </em></strong><a href=\"https://id.theguardian.com/email/list\"><strong><em>This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian’s weekly cricket email.
