But in the end, it wasn’t so simple for James, and the Golden State Warriors won game six in Cleveland 105-97 to take their first NBA championship in 40 years.</p> \n<p>The key to the Warriors’ win was that they appeared not to have a “best” player. NBA regular-season MVP Stephen Curry had 25 points, but it was a balanced attack for Golden State that put the Cleveland on their heels most of the game, chasing after a team that could run the break, dunk, and hit threes when needed. Five of the Warriors scored in double figures.</p> \n<p>Klay Thompson knew who he thought was the best. “We’re the best team in the world with the best player in the world,” Thompson said in the post-game interview as he looked at Curry sitting next to him.</p> \n<p>Curry was modest. “It’s about winning. Stats don’t really matter. Little things make a championship possible,” he said.</p> \n<p>James – wearing shiny gold shoes – finished with 32 points (on 13 of 33 shooting), 18 rebounds and nine assists. But the key stat in the game was the turnovers. The Cavs turned the ball over an incredible 19 times (a team-leading six by James), and those turnovers led to 25 Warrior points. Golden State turned the ball over just nine times, and those led to just 13 Cavs points.<br /></p> \n<p>LeBron said afterwards: “We were under-manned. I don’t know any other team in the history of the NBA that got to the finals without two all-stars. We had our playmakers in suits. For a good playoff run, you have to be healthy and little bit lucky. We weren’t healthy and we weren’t lucky.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457183674__\n</div> \n<p>Cavs coach David Blatt admitted: “Their depth over time did have an impact.”</p> \n<p>Warriors forward Andre Iguodala was the difference maker in victory. He did a decent job defensively on James, ran the floor on the break, drove to the hoop and finished with 25 points, five rebounds and five assists. He was versatile and played with size and speed, and making Warriors coach Steve Kerr look like a genius for putting him in the starting lineup for games five and six.</p> \n<p>Iguodala was named NBA finals series MVP. Golden State coach Steve Kerr said: “It is fitting the [MVP] award went to Andre [Iguodala]. He sacrificed his starting role this year. He did that to make our bench better, to make our team better. He set the tone for everything we accomplished.”</p> \n<p>Thompson said of Iguodala: “He is the ultimate professional … he stepped up when we needed him both on offense and defense. He deserved the NBA finals MVP.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"445ec4eb19ebf77b4341b352cbb0f68520742f4c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/445ec4eb19ebf77b4341b352cbb0f68520742f4c/0_0_2316_1390/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andre Iguodala: MVP\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andre Iguodala: MVP</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Timofey Mozgov only played a total of 9:19 minutes and had no points in game five as the Cavaliers reacted to the Warriors going small in game four. But the Cavs switched gears in this one, playing Mozgov 10 minutes in the opening quarter and 32 minutes in the game. James drove and dished to Mosgov for an easy layup and the Cavs’ first bucket. Mosgov finished with a double-double: 17 points and 12 rebounds in 32 minutes.</p> \n<p> Cavs jumped to a 7-2 lead at the start of the game, but the Warriors outscored the Cavs over the final nine minutes of the first quarter by 26-8, to take a 28-15 lead. The Warriors – with a starting lineup that was basically four forwards and one guard – showed balance in their offense, with a combination of driving layups and long range shooting. Curry led the Warriors in the opening quarter with nine points.</p> \n<p>And the Warriors played big men Andrew Bogut and David Lee very little in this game (just one minute for Lee and a DNP for Bogut), preferring to let Tristan Thompson and Mozgov get points inside. Mozgov and Thompson scored 32 points between them, but the Cavs had little scoring other than those two and James. </p> \n<p>The Cavs hurt themselves with poor execution. Matthew Dellavedova seemed unable to keep pace with Curry, and the Aussie point guard had just one point and two assists in the game. A three point field goal by Iman Shumpert halfway through the second quarter was nullified by an offensive foul away from the ball by Tristan Thompson. James missed three of four free throws in the first half.</p> \n<p> But despite the poor play, Cleveland was behind by just 45-43 after an 8-2 run to close out the half. James has 15 points on six of 14 shooting in the first half. </p> \n<p>The Cavs took the lead early in the fourth quarter on a jump hook in the lane by Thompson (47-45), but the Warriors went on a 9-0 run with 8:13 left in the third quarter to lead 54-47. A fast break dunk by Iguodala with 5:12 left in the third extended the Warriors’ lead to 61-51. Golden State never looked back.</p> \n<p>James did make a steal and ran the floor for a dunk with 10:13 left in the game to cut the Warrior’s lead to seven, 75-68. But after a timeout, Curry hit a three and the lead was up to 10. The two teams traded baskets down the stretch, but it was obvious the Cavs looked tired, and the Warriors continued to move without the ball. It was that team effort that won the game; five in double figures for the Warriors and 28 assists for the NBA champions, compared to just 12 for the Cavaliers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"acb9953a064d95af44dda1c95e747c5a8be88976\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/acb9953a064d95af44dda1c95e747c5a8be88976/0_99_4134_2482/1000.jpg\" alt=\"LeBron James couldn’t propel his Cavs team to victory.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">LeBron James couldn’t propel his Cavs team to victory.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ezra Shaw/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>So the team that had versatile scoring, passed the ball well, and didn’t turn it over much, beat the team with the self-proclaimed “best player in the world.” During one of the official timeouts in the first quarter, the Cavs game presentation crew played Dream On by Aerosmith from 1973 and showed highlights from old Cavs teams – teams that also failed to win it all.</p> \n<p>For Cleveland fans, in a city which has not won a major sports championship since 1964, the mantra looks like it will be “Dream On” once again. But for Warriors fans, who have also been suffering for what seems like forever, the dream came true, because the team played unselfishly and with little ego.</p> \n<p>“The sacrifice this team made, different guys stepping in … just pride. This is an amazing group of guys,” Kerr said as his team celebrated. </p> \n<p>“There’s been all this talk about us only winning by shooting the three-point shot, but what was overlooked was our combination of great offense and great defense. It’s about the balance. It turned into special season as a result.”</p> \n<p>Iguodala said: “I was just happy winning the ring, I don’t care about the MVP stuff.</p> \n<p>“For me it was just playing my game … when I am scoring the ball or not, I try to be an effective force on the court in all the other aspects of the game.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/0a865a2c5da271b1e4057199c03ad11391f17da5/0_103_3155_1893/3155.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1893,"width":3155,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jason Miller/Getty Images","altText":"Golden State Warriors celebrate their victory.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jason Miller/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/445ec4eb19ebf77b4341b352cbb0f68520742f4c/0_0_2316_1390/2316.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1390,"width":2316,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andre Iguodala: MVP Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports","credit":"David Richard/USA Today Sports","altText":"Andre Iguodala: MVP","cleanCaption":"Andre Iguodala: MVP","cleanCredit":"Photograph: David Richard/USA Today Sports"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/acb9953a064d95af44dda1c95e747c5a8be88976/0_99_4134_2482/4134.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2482,"width":4134,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"LeBron James couldn’t propel his Cavs team to victory.

The 29-year-old striker managed just four goals in 29 appearances for Louis van Gaal’s side and a solitary shot on target in his final 12 Premier League games. United duly passed up the chance to make the deal permanent for &pound;43.2m.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/loi-remy-role-chelsea-radamel-falcao\">Lo&iuml;c R&eacute;my to seek assurances at Chelsea over arrival of Radamel Falcao</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Chelsea would have a similar option next summer, albeit for nearer &pound;35m, having agreed to pay a loan fee in the region of &pound;4m for the forward. Falcao earns &pound;265,000 a week under the terms of his contract at Stade Louis II, a figure United covered last term, though it is understood he will waive a proportion of that salary to move to the Premier League champions. Chelsea’s highest earner at present is Eden Hazard on around &pound;200,000 a week and the new arrival is unlikely to match that&nbsp;salary.</p> \n<p>Falcao’s time at Old Trafford was initially hampered by injury, though once available he rarely looked the same powerhouse who had so thrived at Porto and Atl&eacute;tico Madrid – not least at Chelsea’s expense in the 2012 Uefa Super Cup, when he scored a hat-trick – before suffering a serious cruciate knee ligament injury with Monaco which ruled him out of last summer’s World Cup finals. His four United goals came against Everton, Aston Villa, Stoke and Leicester, the last on 31 January, and his campaign rather petered out in frustration.</p> \n<p>Yet Jos&eacute; Mourinho, who shares the same agent as Falcao and has lost Didier Drogba this summer, impressed upon the Chelsea board his belief that he can coax the best from the forward. He went public in his admiration for the Colombian in an interview last week with DirecTV Sports. “I know him very well from when I was in Portugal and Spain,” he said. “For a player of his level and quality, it’s a real shame that people in England think Falcao is the player who was at Manchester United.</p> \n<p>“I don’t have a close relationship with him, but it hurts me because he’s a great player. If there’s any way for me to help the English people to get to know the real Falcao, that would give me pleasure. But I don’t do the negotiations. I just tell the board, my club, the players I’m interested in.”</p> \n<p>Talks between Mendes, Monaco and the Chelsea director Marina Granovskaia, who oversees their transfer and contract negotiations, are now understood to have led to an agreement in principle even if the player is likely to require extensive medical checks once Colombia’s participation in the Copa Am&eacute;rica in Chile is over. The Ligue 1 club could still seek to take players on loan from Chelsea as part of the arrangement having declared an interest in the teenage Belgium Under-21 international Charly Musonda and the Croatia midfielder Mario Pasalic.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/chelsea-homeless-two-seasons-stamford-bridge\">Chelsea may have to vacate Stamford Bridge for at least two seasons</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The completion of the deal for Falcao would leave R&eacute;my contemplating his future at Stamford Bridge, as the France striker had been seeking reassurances he would receive more playing time next year before Euro 2016.

The goal was Wambach’s 14th in a World Cup, making her tied for second highest all-time goals with Germany’s Birgit Prinz, and one behind Brazil legend Marta.</p> \n<p>Wambach’s role in the team <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/abby-wambach-usa-womens-world-cup-nigeria\">had become a topic of discussion</a>, but she returned to the starting line-up for the USA after not starting on Friday for the time in a World Cup match since 2003. Her impact was palpable, setting up defender Julie Johnston for a goal in the first few minutes – but it was chalked off because Johnston was a step offside.</p> \n<p>“We needed a goal, and the timing of it was perfect,” Wambach said. “The longer you stay in a third game in any tournament [without a goal], the more a team like Nigeria gets confidence. So, getting that goal right before half was big for us.”</p> \n<p>“It feels great to help my team win this game, to help my team advance to number one in the group.”</p> \n<p>Although USA were likely to advance to the knockout stage regardless of Tuesday’s result, the match still held major implications. If the Americans hadn’t won Group D and finished second, they would have had to travel five time zones away and 3,500 miles away to Moncton to face Brazil, who won Group E. With their win, the Americans head to the knockout round in Edmonton where they will face a team that finishes third in another group, to be determined after other groups finish play.</p> \n<p>The Nigerians hardly looked up to the task of winning, which they needed to do to book a spot in the knockout rounds. Although they used their speed well on the counter, they looked tentative in the attack, failing to get shots off quickly enough before the American defense swooped in repeatedly the rescue.</p> \n<p>The Americans doubled Nigeria’s shots, 14 to seven, with seven shots on goal to Nigeria’s two, but left the match with a low shot conversion rate and just one goal to show for all their chances. Even as the Nigerians went down to 10 players with 20 minutes left when Sarah Nnodim received a second booking, the Americans still struggled to capitalize.</p> \n<p>“We need a higher conversion rate,” USA coach Jill Ellis said. “It’s in our statistical review, in terms of what we’re trying to achieve in games. The players will be disappointed we didn’t convert, but obviously pleased we got the one.”</p> \n<p>Goalkeeper Precious Dede denied Alex Morgan on a breakaway at the start of the half, lunging to catch the chip attempt over her head. Morgan had a do-over chance 15 minutes later, set up by fullback Ali Krieger, but Dede slid out to smother the ball, denying Morgan again.</p> \n<p>Morgan started her first match since early April. She <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/make-up-shorts-improving-womens-game-brazil?CMP=twt_gu\">told the Guardian last week that she felt ready to start</a>, but only played 12 minutes against Sweden in a scoreless draw on Friday. She was replaced in the 66th minute with Vancouver native Sydney Leroux.</p> \n<p>“I really thought I was going to finish that one from the last couple minutes I was in, but the Nigerian keeper made a really good save, actually,” Morgan said. “I would like to score, but at the end of the day we won, and I felt like I got a really good 65 minutes.”</p> \n<p>Johnston and Becky Sauerbrunn both shone in the their center-back roles, each cutting out dangerous opportunities from Nigeria’s speedy attackers. Nigeria forward Asisat Oshoala had a breakaway in the 25th minute that Johnston tracked back to slide out of play.</p> \n<p>Defender Christie Rampone came on as a late sub and became the oldest player to appear in Women’s World Cup history.</p> \n<p>The USA will face their to-be-determined opponent in Edmonton on June 22. Their opponent will be a third-placed team from Group B, Group E or Group F.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f0a4a6f8348a5c67e0af99c281f6401cd270582d/0_130_4000_2401/4000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2401,"width":4000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Steven Limentani/ISI/Corbis","altText":"Abby Wambach steals in to put USA in front.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Steven Limentani/ISI/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T02:01:49Z","lastModified":"2015-06-17T04:31:26Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":19,"contributors":[{"name":"Caitlin Murray","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caitlin-murray"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women's World Cup 2015","USA women's football team","Football","Sport","Women's football","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/usa-womens-football-team","webTitle":"USA women's football team"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caitlin Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/caitlin-murray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/abby-wambach-usa-nigeria-womens-world-cup","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49pge","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/16/abby-wambach-usa-nigeria-womens-world-cup","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/16/abby-wambach-usa-nigeria-womens-world-cup"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f0a4a6f8348a5c67e0af99c281f6401cd270582d/0_130_4000_2401/4000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2401,"width":4000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Abby Wambach steals in to put USA in front.

He saw the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/16/rafael-nadal-beaten-alexandr-dolgopolov-queens\" title=\"\">first set of Rafael Nadal’s shock defeat by Alexandr Dolgopolov</a>, and reckoned it looked a tricky assignment for the Spaniard, before following him on to Centre Court to beat the Taiwanese qualifier Lu Yen-hsun 6-4, 7-5 in a fairly untroubled 79 minutes, although he dropped serve in each set.</p> \n<p>To compensate for those minor lapses he thrashed 12 aces, 10 of them in the second set, and generally looked comfortable switching from clay – where he has had his most successful season – to the more familiar charms of grass. As Wimbledon preparations go this was a nice way to start, in relatively new shoes too, which aided his balance and movement.</p> \n<p>“Miami in March was the first time I really tried them,” he said. “These ones are good. I moved well today which is pleasing. The first couple of days on the grass here [previously] I have slipped a lot and fell over a couple of times. But I felt like I moved and changed direction pretty well today.</p> \n<p>“It was nice to be back on grass, also [Centre Court] was full from the beginning, a nice atmosphere. I started off a little bit slow, didn’t serve so well, but started hitting better from the back of the court. It’s about getting the balance right, aggressive tennis – but when you play that style first back there’s more of a chance to lose.”</p> \n<p>He will find Fernando Verdasco a considerably more difficult opponent on Thursday and has not forgotten the Spaniard took the first two sets before he tamed him <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/03/andy-murray-wimbledon-fernando-verdasco\" title=\"\">in the quarter-finals on his way to winning Wimbledon</a> two years ago.</p> \n<p>“He’s very dangerous. When he is on his game he’s an extremely tough guy to beat. You can sometimes go a couple of games where you don’t get to see the ball because he’s serving big and hitting his forehand huge,” Murray said. “Then there can be periods in the match where he makes a few mistakes and it’s up to you to capitalise on them and also to try to play a very solid, stable match because he does tend to have ups and downs throughout.</p> \n<p>“If you can stay consistent and solid throughout you’ll get some opportunities. But it’s not an easy thing to do against him. He does hit the ball so hard and he’s flashy. He doesn’t give you much rhythm. It will be tough.”</p> \n<p>If players had to have an adjective as a middle name Murray’s would be Tough. it didn’t quite fit. On Thursday it could be an entirely different matter – and that is just the way he likes it.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434481865693/Andy-Murray-Queens-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray hits a backhand during his first-round 6-4, 7-5 defeat of Taiwan's Lu Yen-hsun at Queen's.
