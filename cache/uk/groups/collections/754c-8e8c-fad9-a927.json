Beneath the headline (“Out with a shout!”), Pep Guardiola could be seen in familiar professorial pose, gesturing urgently at some minor detail of the grand plan – who knows, perhaps even one of the great yawning Sunday league‑style gaps through the middle of his zanily configured defence.</p> \n<p>It is easy to win every game from the safety of the pundits’ sofa, in Jos&eacute; Mourinho’s formulation, just as few could hope to emerge unshaken from a meeting with Lionel Messi in full son‑of‑Zeus mode. But there will be a wider urge to talk Guardiola down a little now that his Bayern project can finally be cast as a narrow failure in its first two seasons.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/12/bayern-munich-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg\">Bayern Munich 3-2 Barcelona (agg 3-5) | Champions League semi-final second leg match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The cult of Pep has after all been a constant counterpoint to his many successes. Much has been made over the past five years of Guardiola’s shining principles, his self-flagellating meticulousness, with awed descriptions of details as minor as his habit of eating only a few small cubes of cheese on matchdays. Perhaps, with football’s spotlight now shifting elsewhere, we can look forward to equally gushing paeans to Luis Enrique’s toast soldiers, Carlo Ancelotti’s Bombay mix and Garry Monk’s Bounty bar.</p> \n<p>What is clear as Bayern prepare to reinforce an ageing team is that adversity can have a clarifying effect. In many ways Guardiola has become more rather than less fascinating with the revelation across successive semi‑final defeats (combined score: 10-3 to the other guys) that those zealously followed principles of possession‑based attacking football can leave his teams doubly vulnerable to more powerful opponents.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/apr/29/bayern-munich-real-madrid-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Real Madrid last year</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/12/bayern-munich-barcelona-champions-league-semi-final-second-leg\" title=\"\">Barcelona this</a> are perhaps the only occasions in his coaching career Guardiola has faced more technically gifted opposition. Both times his Bayern have looked unbalanced, whirling about in a state of some confusion, like all-conquering Dalek warriors confronted for the first time with a bump in the carpet.</p> \n<p>Guardiola was gracious in defeat in Munich. The most interesting part of his post-match press conference came when he took a breath and said of his own team, with some feeling: “We still don’t know … how good these players are.” It was a moment when the insistence that he will stay at Bayern this summer seemed particularly convincing. Guardiola is nothing if not a “process trainer”, a high-grade untangler of knots. What seems likely to keep him anywhere is the allure of solving a problem. And Bayern are now finally in the state they would ideally have reached already when he took over: a little frayed, a few moving parts exposed, as close as a modern-day uber‑club is likely to get to a state of disrepair.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a078bd1300b651da863073a6c64c1ce7d3a9d8c0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431524721440/2d4ba7a2-fa2f-4ac9-be7a-611d8ec74ce3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Pep Guardiola in playful mood with Neymar, Barcelona's destroyer of the Bayern dream.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pep Guardiola in playful mood with Neymar, Barcelona’s destroyer of the Bayern dream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: A. Beier/Getty Images for FC Bayern</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The liberating effect of defeat is that suddenly the manager has some space into which he can grow. Guardiola has often spoken of his admiration for Sir Alex Ferguson’s ability to keep renewing his team and this is what is required as a well-funded but still ticklishly poised process of rebuilding gets under way.</p> \n<p>Encouragingly, Guardiola has some form in this regard. At Barcelona he geared up for his best period by getting shot of Ronaldinho, Deco, Samuel Eto’o and Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Something similar may be required to refresh this ageing champion team. Xabi Alonso, aged 33 and with more than 500 games under his belt, simply cannot run as he did once. Franck Rib&eacute;ry is 32, Bastian Schweinsteiger a high-mileage 30. Philipp Lahm and Arjen Robben remain top-notch players but they are both 31. There is even a suggestion of a problem with Thomas M&uuml;ller, who has had a fine season and remains soldered to his boyhood club but who, with Robert Lewandowski also playing, offers a Guardiola a jarringly un-Pep combination of two large, angular attackers.</p> \n<p>There have already been some good signings, notably Thiago Alc&acirc;ntara and Juan Bernat, and Bayern have been linked with a busload more. Of those that chime with Guardiola’s methods, Antoine Griezmann from Atl&eacute;tico Madrid would offer the right level of speed and craft out wide, and his club-mate Koke some familiar Iberian pass-mastery. Sergio Ramos may be a more fanciful Madrid connection but he would be perfect as a mobile, ball‑playing centre-half to help that risk-and-reward defensive shape make sense. On a similarly hypothetical note – there is no suggestion of it happening – a player of Eden Hazard’s gifts and relative youth would also be a perfect Bayern signing, a wide attacker with the speed and intelligence to respond to Guardiola’s liberating influence.</p> \n<p>There are other options. Career Pep‑ists will also be keen to see him bring through some talent from the juniors. At which point the names of players such as Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, the Danish central midfield prodigy, or Mitchell Weiser, a skilful and adaptable full-back, are usually mentioned. From an emotional point of view there would be no better way for Guardiola to refresh his team and his own legend than with some successful internal promotion.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/13/bayern-munich-pep-guardiola-barcelona-lionel-messi-best-player-champions-league\">Lionel Messi is the best player of all time, says Bayern's Pep Guardiola</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Otherwise, it is in the basic shape and intent of his Bayern team that Guardiola may look to expand and improve. From the pat of the head offered to Messi at half-time at the Allianz Arena, it seems clear enough that Guardiola is still dazzled by, hugely proud of and basically a little goofy over the player he considers the best of all time. Understandably so. There is so much that is thrillingly good in that three‑man Barcelona frontline, which has a chance now to rank its achievements alongside the best of the modern age, from Ronaldinho, Eto’o and Messi, to Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Cristiano Ronaldo, to the gold standard of Rivaldo, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo.</p> \n<p>However, maybe you have to fear, or even resent Messi a little, to configure your defence and midfield in a way that bites sufficiently at his ankles. Certainly while Spain’s big two remain this strong, Guardiola will need either to ratchet his team up to a similar level or find an alternative gear, a way of playing that spoils rather than competes with an opponent’s strengths.</p> \n<p>Guardiola will have considered all this. In Munich he seemed energised not enervated by the prospect of getting to work on a team who are clearly in need of a little transitional working-over.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431524423778/Bayern-Munichs-Pep-Guardi-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bayern Munich's Pep Guardiola was gracious in defeat against Barcelona – now the rebuilding work begins.

Nor, amusingly, do they prevent Strauss offering Pietersen a role as an adviser on one-day cricket.</p> \n<p>One thing is clear: the concept “Kevin Pietersen” is the black hole of English cricket, from whose event horizon there is no escape. Indeed, it bends simplistic laws of time and space by swallowing even things that theoretically predate it. I am literally incapable of hearing the title of Lionel Shriver’s most famous novel – published a full two years before Pietersen had even made his international debut – without thinking of radio phone-ins about Kevin Pietersen.</p> \n<p>I used to think that had to change eventually. I used to think that at some point in the future, I would be able to catch sight of that book’s spine on my shelf and not reflexively hear two generic men shouting at each other. “He’s the best we have!” “He’s not worth it!” When oh when could I return to the halcyon days of innocence when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLRgAe2jLaw\" title=\"\">We Need to Talk About Kevin</a> just made me think of a teenage sociopath using a crossbow to commit mass murder?</p> \n<p>Without getting bogged down in relativity, I now realise that happy place is perpetually beyond my reach.

Megalomania has often given a fillip to science, and I am given to understand that cryonic advances today are basically being driven by the Kevin Pietersen Society’s desire to restore him to this rightful place in the England batting order. There is no point in criticising the brilliant minds now involved in the questionable technical enterprise. As the physicist and inventor Leo Szilard once remarked: “This is not the tragedy of the scientist; it is the tragedy of mankind.”</p> \n<p>Then again, perhaps the cosmic size of the Pietersen problem requires us to think cosmically about it. Only a few weeks ago, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2015/apr/27/stephen-hawking-tells-fans-zayn-malik-could-still-be-in-a-parallel-one-direction\" title=\"\">Stephen Hawking</a> was asked about the universe-shattering event that was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2015/apr/07/zayn-malik-muslim-pop-star\" title=\"\">Zayn Malik</a>’s departure from One Direction, and he answered the question with relish. “My advice to any heartbroken young girl is to pay close attention to the study of theoretical physics,” he said, “because one day there might be proof of multiple universes. It would not be beyond the realms of possibility that somewhere outside of our own universe lies a different universe – and in that universe, Zayn is still in One Direction.” Indeed, that notional heartbroken girl may care to know that in a further possible universe, “she and Zayn are happily married”.</p> \n<p>Is there not something there for bereft Pietersen fans – and indeed those who wish he had stayed South African? Many appear to have already relocated to the universe where his current Test average is something other than 47 – they must now be buoyed by the possibility that, somewhere, he is chalking up triple centuries every innings. Or, at the very least, in for all eternity at The Oval, having notched up 648 at time of going to press.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in this alternative universe, Strauss is now the MP for Kensington and Chelsea, having been elected with the traditional eye-watering majority last Friday. After all, it was only three months ago that Strauss – a Celebrity Conservative – was being linked with the seat, following the resignation of Malcolm Rifkind. (He’d also been touted when Corby became vacant back in 2012.) As Hawking says, you may care to pay close attention to the study of theoretical physics and accept that, somewhere, Strauss is on the fast track to being an inevitably inadequate minister of something or other by 2020, while Michael Vaughan’s first act as director of cricket has been to recall Pietersen.</p> \n<p>Not keen on that one? Then the universe – certainly one of the alternative universes – will provide. Inconceivable though it may seem, we must not discount the possibility of a universe where English cricket is not just going to be run a different shade of idiotically, as indicated by the apparent wild goose chase upon which Graves dispatched Pietersen as almost his first act within the job. And if even that doesn’t offer comfort, I can only leave you with my own preference: that the untried Malik is brought in at No4 for the Ashes, during which he averages 105.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431510357680/Andrew-Strauss-left-and-K-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"When there was trust: Kevin Pietersen, right, and his then England captain Andrew Strauss in happier Ashes-winning times.

He crumbled to the ground, needing treatment. Miraculously, the game started on time and Ongun officiated the match with five stitches in his head. It was as if the incident had never happened.</p> \n<p>Just a few months later another Turkish official, this time Kemal Yilmaz, stumbled to the ground after being hit by a stone during the Super League game between Diyarbakirspor and Bursaspor. Diyarbakirspor’s next match, at Belediyespor, was suspended after a pitch invasion as several supporters tried to hunt down and attack the referee. Huseyin Gocek and his assistants only just managed to avoid the approaching hate mob.</p> \n<p>That was 16 March, 2010, and, of course, it did not stop there.</p> \n<p>The list of awful moments to tarnish the Turkish game is long and, somewhere along the line, the severity of what was happening got worse. The violence grew even more horrific; the attacks even more gruesome.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae1add76e91b2e35cba2aa8a54cfe3cab1ddba44\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/7/1431001729310/1783d0a8-21ac-4840-9b1c-addf711fca83-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A Bursaspor player hides from the objects thrown by Diyarbakirspor fans, as an injured assistant referee lays on the pitch, during the Super League soccer match in Diyarbakir in March 2010.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Bursaspor player hides from the objects thrown by Diyarbakirspor fans, as an injured assistant referee lays on the pitch, during the Super League soccer match in Diyarbakir in March 2010.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ho New/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>During the 1. League game between Mersin Idmanyurdu and Samsunspor on 14 September 2010, the coach of Idmanyurdu, Yuksel Yesilova, was stabbed six times on the pitch. Somehow he survived. The next victim, however, was not as lucky. On 13 May 2013, Burak Yildirim, a 19-year-old student, was stabbed to death on the day of an Istanbul derby, just because he was wearing a Fenerbahce shirt.</p> \n<p>Seven months later and the former Everton player Manuel Fernandes was kicked to the ground by a pitch invader during the Besiktas-Kasimpasa game. Then Galatasaray’s forward Burak Yilmaz suffered a serious face injury when he was hit by a pocket knife thrown from the stands of Rize Sehir Stadium.</p> \n<p>In most other countries it would take just one or two of those incidents for the country’s football association to suspend play and start looking for ways of dealing with the problem. Not in Turkey. In Turkey it needed a gunman to attack the Fenerbahce team bus before anyone reacted.</p> \n<p>On 4 April 2015, in Trabzon, just a few hours after the win against Rizespor, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/apr/04/fenerbahce-team-bus-attacked\" title=\"\">the Fener bus was shot at</a>. Ufuk Kiran, the driver of the bus with 41 passengers on, suffered facial injuries. Drenched in blood, he somehow succeeded in keeping the bus, which was going at 100kmph, on the road. If Kiran had lost consciousness, the bus would have fallen off a cliff, and 42 people, including former Premier League players such as Dirk Kuyt and Emre Bel&ouml;zoğlu, would not be alive today.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8285532f9ee0100af10a1163d8d3af22ca942b18\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/7/1431001868851/edab0533-9157-4f77-bd92-12833f13765b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Galatasaray fans light flares to celebrate their goal against Fenerbahce during the game on 6 April 2014.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Galatasaray fans light flares to celebrate their goal against Fenerbahce during the game on 6 April 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After the shooting, a committee including the minister of sports, Cagatay Kilic, and the president of Turkish Football Federation, Yildirim Demiroren, met in Istanbul to discuss what action to take. In the end the TFF decided to suspend the Super League for one week, a decision that was insufficient from the beginning and made even more hollow by the fact that the game between Besiktas and Basaksehir was allowed to take place that same night and that the lower leagues were allowed to carry on playing.</p> \n<p>No one will be surprised to find out that the violence, together with the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2011/jul/07/turkey-match-fixing\" title=\"\">match-fixing scandal</a> in the summer of 2011, has led to attendances falling. Thousands of fans have turned their back on the game. During the 2008-09 season the average attendance was around 14,000 but that had fallen to 9,000 last season.</p> \n<p>The supporters, referees and even players feel unsafe in our stadiums. The Juventus manager, Massimiliano Allegri, said recently that only <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/apr/27/juventus-max-allegri-torino-crowd-trouble-serie-a-madman-kids-football-stadiums\" title=\"\">“a madman would take children to a football game in Italy”</a> and it is a similar situation in Turkey, only worse.</p> \n<p>So what can be done? What must be done?</p> \n<p>There are two things. First of all, there needs to be punishments that fit the crime. Any guesses what happened to Mustafa Ozel, the hooligan who ran on to the pitch and kicked Fernandes in 2013? Lifetime ban? Ten years? No, the court banned him for one year.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3123660d5031f8c6b00717295289674807f7dc0c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/7/1431002113447/90f2aeba-10a3-4ee7-84cd-0415e582f7f4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Players react after a supporter ran on to the pitch to kick Besiktas' Manuel Fernandes during the game against Kasimpasaspor.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Players react after a supporter ran on to the pitch to kick Besiktas’ Manuel Fernandes during the game against Kasimpasaspor.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anadolu Agency/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Today, two years from the attack, he is free to walk into any stadium and watch any game, all because of the insufficiencies of Law 6,222, that deals with prevention of violence in sport in Turkey.</p> \n<p>The second action that is required is for the TFF to update its disciplinary sanctions so that it can deal with provocative club presidents, who do nothing to deal with the problems surrounding their clubs.</p> \n<p>In fact, in some instances, they incite their fans. Last month, one club president, Aziz Yildirim, told the media: “If the referee Ozgur Yankaya officiates a game of our team one more time, he probably won’t get out of the stadium that easily.”</p> \n<p>Of course Yankaya has not officiated a match in Kadikoy again. And how did the TFF deal with the president? He was banned from watching his team live for 60 days. That is it. Sad, but true.</p> \n<p>So there is the potential for it to get worse before it gets better. Foreign stars such as Demba Ba and Moussa Sow may join the Feyenoord-bound Kuyt in leaving the league in the summer and who can blame them? In the meantime, we are left to pick up the pieces from an awful season. Chaos is bound to happen in places where law is not enforced.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b825cc4502471f74f4ea978d2711230403a77209\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431516473493/fe3d8df0-0d5c-4b89-bcf2-4f5a83b17b4d-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Turkish policemen protect Galatasaray's players after their victory over Fenerbahce at the end of their  match at Sukru Saracoglu Stadium in Istanbul in May 2012.\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Turkish policemen protect Galatasaray’s players after their victory over Fenerbahce at the end of their match at Sukru Saracoglu Stadium in Istanbul in May 2012.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bulent Kilic/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As long as a criminal is not sentenced properly, that person may well repeat the act.</p> \n<p>I do not know what the sports authorities are waiting for in order to take serious action against the violence.

We really do not have any idea.</p> \n<p>In the meantime we are left trying to carry on loving a game that can give us so much pleasure, but that is slowly dying while everyone just stands there watching.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ugurmeleke\" title=\"\"><em>Ugur Meleke</em></a><em> is a football columnist at </em><a href=\"http://www.milliyet.com.tr/\" title=\"\"><em>Milliyet</em></a><em>.

He’s been off the field since the start, which means he couldn’t come in until, we think, five Surrey wickets have fallen.

An excellent afternoon’s cricket but you have to feel for Will Smith, left unbeaten on 64.

If, as Surrey insist, he is returning, or indeed has already returned, after heading for an exploratory scan on a dodgy calf, he hasn’t joined his team-mates out on the field as they attempt to chisel out the remaining Leicestershire batsmen. </p> \n<p>Two have been despatched, Ben Raine, leg before on the back foot to Zafar Ansari, a ball that turned back in to the left-hander out of the footmarks, and Niall O’Brien, who had played with admirable restraint in going to 78 before unaccountably driving Tom Curran high to short extra cover. I say unaccountably because Gareth Batty had put two men there precisely for that reason, Jason Roy and Rory Burns, and Burns it was who delightedly put up two hands to take the catch. </p> \n<p>O’Brien’s dismissal made it 387-7, but Clint McKay has also, for the most part, reined in his attacking instincts, contenting himself with walloping Ansari over midwicket and mid-off a couple of times in going to 30, and with Rob Taylor, still in the process of playing himself in, no mean bat, Leicestershire certainly haven’t abandoned hope here - the more so because Surrey are not just without Pietersen, they’re also without the hamstrung Chris Tremlett, one third of their pace of their pace attack. </p> \n<p>Surrey should still win - it’s still a pretty flat track - but at 394-7, the Foxes lead by 129 runs, with two sessions remaining.</p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55533d39e4b0195e3f974b38","publishedDateTime":"2015-05-13T12:02:13Z","body":"<p><strong>Amy Lofthouse reports from Yorkshire v Hampshire</strong></p> \n<p>Lunch, and Yorkshire will be frustrated by this partnership. Will Smith looks in very good touch, unbeaten on 51, while Lewis McManus is solid on 26. They’ve dealt with everything Gale has thrown at them. Rashid has bowled unchanged from the Rugby Stand End; Brooks, Bresnan and Patterson have taken it in turns from the Kirkstall Lane End.</p> \n<p>Rashid and Brooks are both getting the odd ball to bounce, and Bresnan has angled a few across the batsmen, but Smith is very cautious. He isn’t playing at anything that can be left to harmlessly sail by. Gale has also set some aggressive fields to him - four men around the bat when he first came in. Hampshire have had some lovely batting conditions, although the clouds are just beginning to come over as lunchtime beckons.<br />Two wickets fell fairly early. James Tomlinson was bowled by Rashid as he pushed forward, the ball spinning past his bat to hit the top of off. Sean Ervine, who can be dangerous, also didn’t last long. He edged a Bresnan delivery through to Bairstow to leave Hampshire really struggling at 67-6. The Hampshire dressing room will be pleased with the efforts of the two in the middle, however, as they look steady now on 114-6.</p>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5553287fe4b03b3bccc7a57f","publishedDateTime":"2015-05-13T10:34:02Z","body":"<p><strong>Amy Lofthouse reports from a sunny Headingley</strong></p> \n<p>There was some slight drama this morning as Tim Bresnan, playing a game of warm-up football with the squad, recieved a boot to the face from Jonny Moxon.

Hampshire are basically looking to survive while Yorkshire are searching for their second win of the season. Nightwatchman James Tomlinson is tentative in defence and Rashid is starting to get some good turn. He’s bowled better as the match has gone on and he’s lucky to have a good captain in Gale. If he gets hit around a bit - which, particularly in the first innings he did - Gale keeps him on because he knows that Rashid can sometimes take a while to get into a rhythm and taking him straight out of the attack wouldn’t do his confidence any good.

It is a pertinent question too, as the teams prepare for a get-together on Thursday which will discuss F1’s future.</p> \n<p>The meeting of F1’s strategy group will include the six biggest teams, as well as the sport’s chief executive, Bernie Ecclestone, the governing body – the FIA – and possibly Donald Mackenzie, the co-chairman and co-founder of CVC Capital Partners, the biggest shareholders in the sport.</p> \n<p>Thursday’s meeting will take place against a background of mounting concern, with declining sponsorship and falling live and television audiences. Also, most of the teams are struggling to come to terms with the colossal cost of just taking part.</p> \n<p>But the crux of the debate, as the sport decides on what turn it will take in 2017, is its decline as a spectacle. Some of the racing in the past year has been memorable but there have also been too many drab events and two of the opening five races this season have been very disappointing.</p> \n<p>As well as being quieter, the cars are now, generally, a few seconds slower than they were a decade ago – and this in a sport that is meant to be at the cutting edge of new technology.</p> \n<p>David Coulthard, whose long F1 career ended in 2008, said on Tuesday: “There was a time not so very long ago when F1 was physically and mentally exhausting for the drivers. That is no longer the case.</p> \n<p>“For any normal human being, the cars would still be impossibly tough to drive. But F1 drivers are finely honed athletes of the highest calibre and the current cars simply do not stretch them.</p> \n<p>“When you look back and see the likes of Ayrton Senna and Nigel Mansell struggling to stand up after races, it’s not that they were not in good shape, the cars were simply very tough to drive and they were challenged the whole way.”</p> \n<p>There are a number of reasons for this. The sensitivity of the tyres means that the drivers must look after their rubber. The cars are also more sluggish these days – at least at the start of the race – because they are carrying a full fuel load following the cancellation of refuelling. They have also been slowed for safety reasons, and there is not enough overtaking, despite the artificial aid of DRS.</p> \n<p>But there appears little appetite for radical change within the sport and Ecclestone’s call for the return of the old V8s and for the introduction of 1,000hp power units that are “more difficult to drive” has had little response.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Neale, McLaren’s racing chief operations officer, said: “Personally, I think it would be foolish to mess around with the immense amount of good work that has been done on the power units.”</p> \n<p>Paddy Lowe, the Mercedes technical director, added: “I don’t think we need to run around thinking we have to do drastic things.” Meanwhile, the head of performance at Williams, Rob Smedley, said: “I think we should leave it alone.”</p> \n<p>So perhaps we should look on Pastor Maldonado in a fresh light and better appreciate the enthusiastic contribution he makes to the sport’s entertainment.</p> \n<p>Just don’t get in his way, that’s all.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431518956181/Pastor-Maldonado-in-his-L-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Pastor Maldonado in his Lotus during the Barcelona F1 Grand Prix weekend.
