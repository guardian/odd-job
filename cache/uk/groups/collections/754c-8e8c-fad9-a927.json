He won the equivalent of the Rising Star award for best young player, and was poached by Richmond the following year. He joined Brisbane in 1987, picking up the club’s best and fairest award.</p> \n<p>A handy wingman, it was as an old-school coach – “a hard man, a hard taskmaster,” Adelaide legend Graham Cornes said – that Walsh left his biggest imprint on the game.</p> \n<p>He became Geelong’s strength and conditioning coach in 1995, joined Port Adelaide as an assistant coach four years later and then West Coast in 2009. Last year he re-joined Port, before applying for the vacant spot at the Crows and winning it.</p> \n<p>“He bloomed, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for,” Cornes said on Friday.</p> \n<p>This obsessive focus on football left little room for anything else. Asked if he was a good father, he admitted “that’s a really hard question”.</p> \n<p>“The bonus of me taking the Crows job is my son is 26 and my daughter is 22, so the collateral damage isn’t so big. But have I been a good father? To my son, I had a disconnect because of footy,” he said.</p> \n<p>“In a selfish way, I taught my daughter to surf, and that’s my release, so when I go surfing, I take her. Now I’ve got my son into it as well and that’s what I should’ve done a long time ago.</p> \n<p>“A couple of months ago we all went surfing together at Middleton and it was almost the best day I’ve had ... ever,” he said.</p> \n<p>“We all got a wave, went to the bakery on the way home, we smiled, and laughed and there was none of this stuff, that I’ve got Melbourne, then the Bulldogs, then Port. Just none of that.”</p> \n<p>Single-mindedly was the way you played sport in Hamilton, a town set among sheep pastures in Victoria’s west. The grass never got a chance to grow at the Walsh house, trampled by his five hockey-playing sisters and his own backyard heroics.</p> \n<p>“Those days, you were either playing or training virtually every night of the week, except Sundays, even as kids,” a friend, Brian Guy, <a href=\"http://v\">told the Adelaide Advertiser</a>.</p> \n<p>His qualities as a leader were obvious. Walsh was elected school vice-captain at Monivae College, where he is still listed as a wingman in the school’s team of the century.</p> \n<p>“I’d say Walshy was limited skill-wise, but jeez, he was fit,” former Collingwood team-mate, Gavan Bell said. “That was his key. He was a good player, courageous, all that stuff. He was a hard working, defensive winger. That’s what he was about.”</p> \n<p>A near-death experience in Peru in late 2012 – he was hit by a bus and flown back to Australia for treatment – had broadened his horizons. “I saw the white light, had the drowning sensation,” Walsh said. “I thought I’d die.”</p> \n<p>He quit drinking, dedicated himself to mastering Japanese and kept an image of the Peruvian street as his screensaver. “That’s my wake up call every day, as soon as I turn my computer on,” <a href=\"http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/adelaide-coach-phil-walsh-invites-mark-robinson-into-the-inner-sanctum-of-the-crows-and-his-life/story-fnp04d70-1227308300112\">he told the Herald Sun</a>. “Don’t get too angry, Phil.”</p> \n<p>Walsh had yet to complete his first year as Adelaide’s coach when he died on Friday, aged 55. The level of esteem he had built over two decades in the coaches’ box was only beginning to be known.</p> \n<p>“He spoke at [former Melbourne coach] Dean Bailey’s funeral, and he spoke so beautifully and eloquently and without notes,” Cornes recalled on Friday. “You gained the sense immediately there there was a depth and a side to this man the rest of the world needed to see.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7563a63c6aaa3268f3a7256a7e3990a36a36b336/0_129_2500_1500/2500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1500,"width":2500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Michael

Cambers at Wimbledon","body":"<p>Rafael Nadal was knocked out of Wimbledon in the first week for the third time in four years, bamboozled by the wild but often brilliant game of the qualifier Dustin Brown, a man who spent three years living in a camper van as he travelled Europe trying to earn a living. The German hit numerous drop shots, some unbelievable returns and generally kept the 10th seed off balance and out of kilter, clinching a 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/rafael-nadal-bounce-back-wimbledon-defeat-dustin-brown\">Rafael Nadal vows to bounce back from Wimbledon defeat to Dustin Brown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Remarkably, it was Nadal’s fourth straight Wimbledon loss to an opponent ranked outside the top 100 and, after losing his hold on the French Open title last month, he must now find a way to pick himself up on the North American hard courts later this summer.</p> \n<p>“I’m happy I got to play him on that court win or lose,” said Brown. “All the kids that play tennis dream about being able to play on that Centre Court. Playing against him there is special. Also being able to put that performance together, it was definitely very difficult and I’m very happy that I held it together for the whole match.”</p> \n<p>It was not quite the shock it would have been a few years ago – Nadal lost in the second round in 2012 and the first round a year later, and also lost to Brown on grass in Halle last year. But it was still a surprise for the man who has won 14 grand slams and picked up the title here in 2008 and 2010 to lose to a someone ranked 102, who had lost in the first round in each of his past five grand slam events. But the 30-year-old Brown has a playing style all of his own and for once he put it together on the biggest stage to record the best win of his career, slamming 58 winners in the process.</p> \n<p>Born in Germany but raised in Jamaica before switching his nationality back to that of his native land in 2010, the dreadlocked, athletic Brown has the kind of unorthodox game that can infuriate many a better player, causing them to lose rhythm.</p> \n<p>Nadal wore a forlorn expression on his face for much of the match, never able to relax as Brown came forward at every opportunity. Slicing forehands and hitting drop shots at will, he looked to be enjoying the whole experience, which cannot be said for Nadal.</p> \n<p>Still, the Spaniard had his chances. An early break gave him a 2-1 lead in the first but some poor serving gave Brown the break back for 3-3. Nadal’s serve looked vulnerable and when he offered Brown a set point at 5-6, he was almost knocked over by a blistering backhand return and the set was gone. As in the first, Nadal broke for 2-1 in the second set and this time he held on, breaking for a second time to level the match.</p> \n<p>It seemed unlikely that Brown would be able to maintain his standard of play but that is what Nadal thought when Lukas Rosol beat him in round two in 2012. As then, so Brown continued to attack and after a double fault from the Spaniard, another brilliant drop volley gave Brown a 4-3 lead, which he maintained to take the third set.</p> \n<p>Nadal’s mental resilience has never been in doubt – after all, he had won the title in Stuttgart on grass the week after losing his French Open crown, having lost to Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals. But against such a big server and free hitter as Brown, he knew that one mistake could be fatal. It came in the opening game of the fourth set when, having saved one break point with a good serve, he missed two bread-and-butter forehands to hand Brown the break.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/roger-federer-sam-querrey-wimbledon-2015\">Roger Federer shows sublime touch to beat Sam Querrey at Wimbledon 2015</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nadal’s last hope was that Brown’s nerve would fail him but, though he blew a chance for a double break, missing a break point in the fifth game, he continued to press. The only time Brown’s nerve failed him was when, at 5-3 and 15-40 on the Nadal serve he held two match points, but let a pass go that he could have made, only to see it land smack on the baseline.</p> \n<p>Nadal then saved the second match point and held serve to force Brown to serve it out. Suddenly the comeback seemed a possibility but Brown served brilliantly, sealing it with an ace for a remarkable victory.</p> \n<p>His reward is a clash with Viktor Troicki of Serbia, a four-set winner over Britain’s Aljaz Bedene. Nadal had been a possible last-eight opponent for Andy Murray but if Brown continues to play like this, then it is not beyond the realms of possibility he could make it there himself.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435862732799/Dustin-Brown-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dustin Brown celebrates after winning the third set against Rafael Nadal in their second-round match at Wimbledon.

The Spaniard, who won the title in 2008 and 2010 but who has slipped down to No10 in the rankings after struggles with form and confidence, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\">was beaten 7-5, 3-6, 6-4, 6-4</a> in the second round by Dustin Brown, a German qualifier ranked 102.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\">Rafael Nadal crashes out of Wimbledon after bravura Dustin Brown display</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Looking more down than ever as he tried to sum up the effect of another early defeat – his fourth consecutive loss before the quarter-finals here – Nadal said the only thing he can do is keep trying to get back to the form that took him to 14 grand slam titles. “I lost,” he said. “Sad today for that, obviously. But end of the day, that’s sport. Good moments, bad moments. Obviously today is a bad moment for me.</p> \n<p>“I just need to accept these kind of things that can happen. I did all my career. Keep going. It’s not the end. It is a sad moment for me but life continues. My career, too. I have to keep going and working more than ever to try to change that dynamic.”</p> \n<p>When he lost in round two in 2012 and in the first round in 2013, Nadal had been struggling physically, with his knees a real problem. Last year, when he lost in round four to Australia’s Nick Kyrgios, he was blown off the court and on Thursday, Brown outgunned him with power and finesse.</p> \n<p>“It is obvious that 2012 and 2013 were not an issue,” he said. “I was not competitive. Too much problems on my knees. Last year and this year, no problems at all with my knees. I was ready to compete. I lost. I don’t know if I will be back to the level of 2008 or 2010 or 2007 or 2006 or ’11.</p> \n<p>“My motivation is try to be back to that level. I am going to keep working on that. But if I don’t make that happen, actually I played five times here the last day, had the trophy back home two times, so it is not bad. At the end of the day, today I lost. Don’t forget I played five finals here. I don’t know how many players did that.”</p> \n<p>Nadal, who lost his French Open title last month when he was beaten by Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals, rued a series of missed chances to beat Brown, who played well above his ranking and threw the Spaniard off his game with aggressive net play backed up by stunning shot-making and dozens of drop shots.</p> \n<p>The Spaniard admitted he had simply made too many mistakes and left himself too much to do. “On this court especially, you meet players that don’t want to play from the baseline sometimes,” he said. “You cannot have mistakes against a player like him with that big serve, nothing to lose, serving first and second almost the same speed. Without having rhythm at all. I didn’t hit three balls in a row the same way. Then when you need to hit that ball, extra ball, you don’t have the confidence to do it. That’s what happened.”</p> \n<p>Having gone two sets to one down, Nadal said the start of the fourth set had been the final straw. “First game of the fourth set was terrible for me,” he said. “A very disappointing moment. Two forehands that I should not make the mistake with. I did not play that forehand during the whole match. Arrive at that one, you lose confidence, you miss another.</p> \n<p>“Then I fought at the end, but no chance at all on the return. That’s it.”</p> \n<p>Nadal will return home to Mallorca, try to forget the experience and move on. “I had the right preparation, all the things I thought were going to be fine to play a good Wimbledon,” he said. “I am not a person that will be thinking about it for the next two weeks.

She’s inconsolable and we didn’t deserve that as a team. We deserved to go through. We were the better team. It’s crap, isn’t it!”</p> \n<p>A Japan side who had been a little condescending towards England ended up being really put through their paces and the winger Carney gave the impression she will not cheering them on in Sunday’s final <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/womens-world-cup-usa-into-final-after-carli-lloyd-tames-germany\" title=\"\">against the USA</a> in Vancouver.</p> \n<p>“Their karma, or whatever it is, will get them,” she said before turning her attention to the legacy the Lionesses trust will be created by their achievement in reaching a semi-final for the first time. “We believed we would come back with a gold medal, we believed we would win the trophy but we haven’t,” she said.</p> \n<p>“Hopefully, though, we’ve inspired a nation. Hopefully we’ve changed a lot of stereotypes and a lot of people’s perceptions about women’s football.”</p> \n<p>The sense that a watershed has been reached is acute. “Hopefully people now fully respect us,” Carney said. “Hopefully young girls, and young boys, now admire England, are backing our team and have rediscovered a love for the game.</p> \n<p>“I think we’ve got a lot of respect for the way we are as people. We’re just normal people who put on a jersey for our country and give everything. Television viewers would have seen that after the game, seen how heartbreaking it was for us.”</p> \n<p>And one player in particular. “We’re all looking after Laura, letting her know it wasn’t her fault,” said Carney. “We’re there for her; we’re a team through all the highs and lows. We have to stick together.</p> \n<p>“We just need to look after Laura now. We’re 100% going to give her all the love and support she needs. Losing wasn’t just about the own goal, it just wasn’t meant to be today.”</p> \n<p>As Bassett enjoyed the additional consolation offered by her boyfriend and her brother – who, without accreditation, performed the not insignificant task of persuading Fifa officials to permit him into the Lionesses’ dressing room to comfort his sister at the final whistle – Carney attempted to look forward to Saturday’s third place play-off against Germany. “We’ve got to get our jerseys back on,” she said. “We’ve got to try and get that third place.”</p> \n<p>It was a message reiterated by Steph Houghton. “Now we have Germany,” said Mark Sampson’s captain. “We’re desperate to finish third. Fingers crossed we can do that.</p> \n<p>“We’re devastated to have lost to Japan but they are world champions for a reason and we were immense. Hopefully we did the nation proud. Our aim was to try and inspire young girls in England – and we were that close to the final.

I couldn’t be prouder of everyone.”</p> \n<p>During the Lionesses’ long trek across Canada, all the way from the Atlantic coast to the Pacific, they have increasingly captured hearts and minds – and Houghton could not be more delighted.</p> \n<p>“We’re aware a little bit of how we’ve been received back home but when I talk to my family they tell me how much it has gripped the nation,” she said. “We wanted to do England proud and I think we have.</p> \n<p>“The amount of TV exposure we’ve had and the attention women’s football has got has been brilliant.

They warned that the momentum could soon be lost if it wasn’t translated into increased visibility for the domestic game. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We were immense and hopefully we did the nation proud.

That was the aim, to try and inspire young girls. We were that close – football really can be very cruel,” said Houghton. </p> \n<p>As her teammates and manager Mark Sampson rallied around Bassett, BBC presenter Jacqui Oatley said the defender’s misfortune would only endear her to the public. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/england-women-laura-bassett-mother-bounce-back\">Laura will bounce back after England own goal, insists Bassett’s mother</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Oatley, a player until injury prematurely ended her career, said the women’s game had made steady strides since the FA launched the Women’s Super League (WSL) two years ago, but that clubs and sponsors needed to seize the moment. </p> \n<p>The WSL, which has been on pause during the tournament, returns on 12 July. The women’s FA Cup final – in which Bassett’s Notts County Ladies will play Chelsea at Wembley – is on 1 August. </p> \n<p>“It can be a transformational moment, but whether it will be is the most important thing. It’s down to the marketeers, and they need to act quickly while people are still talking about women’s football,” Oatley said. </p> \n<p>“After 2012 there was a lot of buoyancy, but nothing was actually done. Something structurally needs to change in terms of the way the game is marketed.”</p> \n<p>England manager Mark Sampson, who praised the “superhuman” effort of his players, said: “I’m going to demand that everyone back home really ups their game and we commit everything we can to keep growing this sport in our country.”</p> \n<p>Holdaway said that the domestic game remained “underfunded and under-appreciated”. She added: “Hopefully sponsors will wake up to women’s football as a great opportunity to raise their profile and enhance their brand value by supporting and further developing the momentum behind women’s sport in the UK.”</p> \n<p>While there are plenty of parallels with the heartache of the men’s team down the years, there is no comparison when it comes to financial rewards. There are only 27 full-time professionals in the WSL and others, such Deutsche Bank analyst Claire Rafferty, have to balance playing with a full-time job. </p> \n<p>“It’s a two-pronged attack. On the one hand, you want to inspire people to buy tickets, get commercial sponsors more interested, get sports editors interested,” said Oatley, once the first female commentator on Match of the Day. </p> \n<p>“The second prong is to get young girls going out and kicking a ball with their brothers and sisters in the garden. The more young girls play and the better the standard of coaching is, the more talent will come through.” </p> \n<p>Participation in the women’s game is growing – in 1993 there were just 80 registered girls’ teams, today there are 5,143, with 1,437 registered adult sides. But there are still fears that negative stereotypes persist among some parents and teachers. </p> \n<p>For half a century, women were banned from even playing football in England, but the FA has thrown all its weight behind the Lionesses. As well as making household names of some of the players, it has launched a We Can Play campaign aimed at dispelling myths around women’s football and making it attractive to seven to11-year-old girls. </p> \n<p>The FA’s research showed that even among girls of that age who played football, four out of five didn’t feel confident doing so due to peer pressure and negative stereotyping. </p> \n<p>“The amount of TV exposure we have had and the attention women’s football has got has been brilliant. We want to be role models and hopefully girls are inspired to get to the World Cup and start playing at a younger age,” said Houghton after the Japan match. </p> \n<p>The research also showed that parents were far less likely to encourage daughters to play football than sons.</p> \n<p>“Women’s football has had an image problem in this country, something they don’t suffer from in the US or Scandinavia,” said Oatley, who will front BBC3’s coverage of England’s third-place play-off against Germany at 8.30pm on Saturday.</p> \n<p>“Hopefully, one of the positive things from this World Cup will be that mums and dads will look at what these England players have achieved and think about it as a desirable sport.”</p> \n<p>Amid the tributes flooding Twitter from current and former England players –including Lineker, Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney – winger Karen Carney wrote: “Our aim was 1) gold medal 2) inspire a nation!!

No boundary here is sacred now.</p> \n<p>Ward – who will keep his Davis Cup place ahead of Bedene after the ITF recently denied his right to represent his adopted country – next plays the accomplished young Canadian Vasek Pospisil, who beat the eccentric, dangerous Italian Fabio Fognini 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 in just over two hours on Court 12.</p> \n<p>Murray, however, remains the kingpin of the British game. After coming through a tougher examination in the first round against Mikhail Kukushkin, he hit another level against Haase, beating him 6-1, 6-1, 6-4 in under an hour and a half.</p> \n<p>His opponent on Saturday is the Italian Andreas Seppi, who finished impressively to see off the precocious challenge of the rising Croatian star Borna Coric 4-6, 6-4, 6-7 (3), 6-1, 6-1.</p> \n<p>Murray, who is enormously supportive of other British players, was particularly pleased for Ward, who bears the perennial mien of the put-upon underdog, although he was quick to put his achievement in perspective.</p> \n<p>“Obviously the draw opened up,” Murray said. “He was to play [David] Ferrer in the first round – an extremely difficult draw. Then playing a lucky loser [Luca Vanni] in the first round, he’s taken advantage of the opportunity that he’s had at a very important time for him, as well, because he hadn’t won so many matches lately.</p> \n<p>“After here, he has quite a lot of points to defend. It was very important for him to capitalise on that. He’s won a couple of good matches. Today I saw the last couple of games. Vesely is a tough opponent. It was a good win for James today. He has an opportunity again in the third round.”</p> \n<p>Ward was plainly thrilled about his progress, although typically downbeat in his response to even the slightest praise. “It’s great,” he said. “Obviously my ranking goes up, into third round of Wimbledon … I can’t ask for anything more at the moment.”</p> \n<p>Asked whether winning back-to-back matches at Wimbledon was comparable to Arsenal, his team, winning two FA Cups in a row, he said, “Winning third round would probably be like Arsenal winning the league next year, to be honest. After that, we start thinking about Champions League finals. Let’s think about Saturday first.”</p> \n<p>Ward and Murray have an interest in the north London club, Ward’s driven by birth – he is the son of a Euston cab driver – Murray’s by an admiration for their football. It is a bond that has contributed to the good feeling between them, either as Davis Cup team-mates or campaigning in a slam, which they are doing side by side now, rather than Ward going home early.</p> \n<p>“He’s just a good friend above all,” Ward said. “We get on really well. We have a lot of the same interests as well outside of tennis. He’s always there supporting, he’s always watching matches. A lot of people know that he follows live streams of challengers, is always there to send you a message when you’ve done well, or pick you up when you need a bit of support.</p> \n<p>“A lot of stuff that he does and says really doesn’t get reported that much. As I said for few of us, it’s nice to have that support from such a great player.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/02/wimbledon-2015-day-four-live\">Rafael Nadal knocked out of Wimbledon 2015 by Dustin Brown – day four as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murray added: “I’ve spent a lot of time with him over the last 12, 18 months.We’ve done a few training blocks together. He stayed with me in Miami a few times. I watch a lot of his matches online when he’s playing challengers and stuff.”</p> \n<p>As for their joint assault on the third round, Ward remains cool-headed rather than sentimental. “Everyone is concentrating on their own thing,” Ward said. “It’s great for British tennis and it’s great for everyone involved that more people are winning matches and doing well. But, as I say, I’ve got to worry about my match. Andy worries about his. Aljaz worries about his as well.”</p> \n<p>Murray is looking only towards his match against Seppi. “He has had such good results this year. He made the final a couple of weeks ago in Halle, plays well on the grass. He won against Roger [Federer] at the Australian Open this year. He’s capable of playing some top tennis.”</p> \n<p>Ultimately, they are all on their own here.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435871384916/487fd76a-a7fb-4c2e-9a9e-229b6e9f52c1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media/UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media","altText":"James Ward","cleanCredit":"Photograph: UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media/UPI /Landov / Barcroft Media"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T21:15:59Z","lastModified":"2015-07-02T23:55:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Kevin Mitchell","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741641/KevinMitchell.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kevinmitchell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Wimbledon 2015","Andy Murray","James Ward","Wimbledon","Tennis","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/wimbledon-2015","webTitle":"Wimbledon 2015"},{"id":"sport/andymurray","webTitle":"Andy Murray"},{"id":"sport/james-ward","webTitle":"James Ward"},{"id":"sport/wimbledon","webTitle":"Wimbledon"},{"id":"sport/tennis","webTitle":"Tennis"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kevin Mitchell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kevinmitchell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-james-ward-wimbledon","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abgv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-james-ward-wimbledon","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/02/andy-murray-james-ward-wimbledon"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435871384916/487fd76a-a7fb-4c2e-9a9e-229b6e9f52c1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Ward celebrates his four-set victory against Jiri Vesely at Wimbledon.

I have lost the last few matches against him but I have nothing to lose so I’m going to give it my best. But his game is for sure better than mine.”</p> \n<p>Perhaps the Italian is being overly harsh on himself. Seppi has enjoyed victory in 50 of his 83 matches on grass – a win percentage of more than 60%, better than his record on any other surface. His first ATP title also came on the grass of Eastbourne in 2011, and he also reached the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/21/roger-federer-wins-halle-open-eighth-time\">final of Halle last month</a>, losing to Roger Federer in two close sets.</p> \n<p>Seppi also holds the distinction of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2006/jun/22/tennis.andymurray\">beating Murray on grass </a>in Nottingham in 2006, but there is a major caveat. Since then he has become the Scot’s ‘bunny’ – not only losing all six of their subsequent encounters, but also without even taking a set off him. Still, he was pleased in the way he came back to defeat Coric. The Croatian is one of the most exciting talents in the game, having already beaten Murray and Rafael Nadal this year. And the 18-year-old looked to be adding Seppi to his list of scalps before he ran out of gas.</p> \n<p>Earlier there had been very little to separate the players in a first set full of baseline rallies, until a solitary break at 4-4 helped Coric win the set in 39 minutes.</p> \n<p>But, just as the momentum appeared to swing towards the Croatian, it juddered sharply the other way. Seppi broke immediately at the start of the second set and established a 3-0 lead. At this point Coric appeared to be losing his head – there were cries of frustration as lines were repeatedly cleared – but he broke back for 3-3 only for Seppi to win the second set 6-4.</p> \n<p>Seppi appeared to be pushing on, and was 3-0 up in the third when Coric needed extensive treatment on his left hamstring. Yet he recovered to take the third set on a tie break. However, with Coric’s energy levels emptying fast, Seppi raced through the final sets, losing just two games.</p> \n<p>While Seppi did many things well– notably getting 75% of returns in play and breaking his opponent 10 times – he did few things exceptionally. Despite his 6ft 3in height, there were just 15 aces in five sets. Too often he let his opponent dictate points, relying on the counter-punch or an error. Murray is unlikely to be so pliant. Yet the fact Seppi <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jan/23/australian-open-roger-federer-andreas-seppi-report\">beat Federer in the Australian Open</a> earlier this year suggests he will be dangerous, at least initially. But facing Murray on Centre Court will surely be an even tougher test.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435866087987/Italys-Andreas-Seppi-dive-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Italy's Andreas Seppi dives as he attempts to return to Croatia's Borna Coric during their men's singles second round match at Wimbledon.

I take a lot of motivation from this.”</p> \n<p>The winner of the 2007 and 2009 Tours added he would have preferred to be on the start line feeling as he did in 2014 before his race was curtailed after breaking his leg in a fall during the 10th stage. “It’s new to me, how my body will respond to the effort.”</p> \n<p>The Spaniard believes the 2015 race is “one of the most open in Tour history”: “In the first nine days there are six intense stages. It will be a Tour without respite.”</p> \n<p>He rates the 2014 Giro winner, Nairo Quintana of Movistar, as favourite in a Tour “for the climbers”. But he also sees his major challengers as last year’s winner, Vincenzo Nibali of Astana, citing the Italian’s consistency, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/video/2013/jul/23/chris-froome-tour-de-france-2013-video-highlights\" title=\"\">and the 2013 champion, Sky’s Chris Froome</a>. “On his day he has a change of rhythm that nobody can follow,” Contador admitted.</p> \n<p>While those four appear to be the main contenders to wear the yellow jersey into Paris, Trek Factory Racing’s Fabian Cancellara has his eyes firmly set on winning Saturday’s prologue in the Netherlands, in what may prove to be his final Tour. Nicknamed Spartacus for his aggressive riding style, the Swiss crashed badly in March and missed the Cobbled Classics. He battled back at the Tour de Suisse, narrowly losing the opening prologue to the Dutchman Tom Dumoulin of Giant-Alpecin, who will meanwhile carry local hopes at the Grand D&eacute;part in Utrecht.</p> \n<p>“I’m looking forward to this,” Cancellara said. “I have my goals and my ambitions but first I will try also to enjoy the race and all the experience I have to put it into the race because it is a special one, a tough one.”</p> \n<p>Among his challengers will be Tony Martin (Etixx-Quickstep), the three-time world time trial champion and Britain’s Alex Dowsett (Movistar) who held the Hour record until Sir Bradley Wiggins broke it in style in June.</p> \n<p>After his press conference, some Dutch journalists presented Contador with a canary – he bred them before turning professional – and the Spaniard named it Yellow. He will be hoping it isn’t the only yellow he takes home from the 2015 Tour.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435857786404/Tour-de-France-2015-press-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Contador receives a yellow canary from the hosts of Dutch TV programme Bureau Sport during a press conference in Utrecht.

I just really look forward to playing her. Draws are funny like that. Sometimes you can play the same person three weeks in a row, and then you might not play one person for maybe three years. She is a great champion and a legend in the game, so it will be a great experience for me – and where better for me to play her than here at Wimbledon?”</p> \n<p>Watson has gone this deep after a fighting come-from-behind win over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/heather-watson-caroline-garcia-wimbledon\">Caroline Garcia</a> – the French player identified a few years ago by Andy Murray as one to watch – and an even more impressive 6-4, 6-2 victory over the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/heather-watson-daniela-hantuchova-wimbledon-serena-williams\">Slovakian Daniela Hantuchova</a> on Wednesday. It has buoyed her occasionally flagging spirits. Serena, the world No1 and obvious favourite, gave up just five games to the Russian qualifier <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/29/serena-williams-margarita-gasparyan-wimbledon-2015-first-round\">Margarita Gasparyan</a> then beat the Hungarian <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/01/serena-williams-beats-timea-babos-wimbledon-2015-heather-watson\">Timea Babos</a> by the same margin. She has not been remotely stretched yet.</p> \n<p>Watson said she first became aware of the Williams sisters on her initial visit to Wimbledon as a child.</p> \n<p>“It was when I came to Wimbledon and I bought two posters. I was like seven or eight years old. One was Venus and Serena together and one was Roger Federer. Those were the three players that I liked. They went straight up on my wall.”</p> \n<p>She next saw Serena at Nick Bollettieri’s academy in Florida. “When I was 12 or 13 at school there it was a big thing for her to come and train, so all of our teachers let us out of school to go and watch her practise and play. We were just hundreds of us schoolkids there. I don’t know if she signed autographs there. And now I might get the opportunity to play her, and it’s really exciting. When people that don’t know much about tennis find out I play tennis, one of the first questions is: ‘Have you played Serena?’ And I’m like: ‘No – but I have played Venus.’”</p> \n<p>Watson says she does not know either of them socially, adding: “Yeah I would say hello – but I say hello to everybody!”</p> \n<p>As for Serena’s legendary regal presence in the locker room, Watson said: “I always find I don’t see her that much. I don’t know what time she practises. Some people you see all the time, but I hardly see her. But she does have a presence about her. She is a strong woman, and even if she wasn’t a tennis player she would have a presence.”</p> \n<p>All of that will count for nothing at all when they confront each other on Friday. Watson has had stretches of form this year that promised more than they delivered. Playing at Wimbledon might well provide a significant edge to her game but she will do well just to stay in the contest with one of the greatest players of all time.</p> \n<p>Serena is not just No1 of this and many other years, and of her era, but a contender for consideration at the very peak of her sport. Watson will hardly admit beforehand that the privilege of playing her would be enough for her, but, on balance, that is not a bad result.</p> \n<p>And she would likely prefer this match against a legend than a softer one in another part of the draw.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435855320362/Wimbledon-Championships-2-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Heather Watson has impressed at Wimbledon this year but now faces Serena Williams.

Petra Kvitova was not in the mood for fun and games.</p> \n<p>She started with an ace, banged down another and held to love to hammer home the size of the task facing Kurumi Nara, who was beginning to appreciate the feeling of resignation that so many of Kvitova’s victims on these lawns have experienced in the past.</p> \n<p>Kvitova led 2-0 five minutes later, breaking her Japanese opponent’s serve with one of her trademark forehand scythes, and even someone with entry-level powers of precognition would have known that the defending Wimbledon champion was heading for the third round and a meeting with Jelena Jankovic, who beat Evgeniya Rodina 6-7, 6-1, 6-3.</p> \n<p>The No2 seed has made an ominous start to the defence of her title and she was in breathtaking form in her resounding 6-2, 6-0 victory in 57 minutes over Nara. At times like this, there is a compelling case to be made for offering players a shovel instead of a racket, giving them a way to erect an escape route from their Kvitovian torture chamber.</p> \n<p>Not that Kvitova will take anything for granted against Jankovic. “It’s always a big challenge to face her,” she said. “Former No1 player. It’s always little bit special. Always she has a weapon to play. Especially her backhand – it’s really great. I played her in Rome, I never played her on grass. It’s really different.”</p> \n<p>It is not that Nara, the world No57, played badly, simply that the 23-year-old was hopelessly outgunned in every facet of the game by Kvitova, who will take some stopping as she chases her third title here. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/30/petra-kvitova-wimbledon-kiki-bertens\" title=\"\">At least Nara lasted longer than Kvitova’s first-round patsy, Kiki Bertens</a>, who was vanquished in a staggering 36 minutes on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>Kvitova was always in control, never forced out of her comfort zone. At times she was like a big tree that was firmly rooted in the middle of the baseline, extending her swinging branches to the side to clump a slew of fearsome backhands and forehands past a bewildered Nara.</p> \n<p>To her credit, Nara fought hard and she drew appreciative applause from the crowd when she caught Kvitova out with a clever forehand lob in the fifth game of the first set. But mostly the patrons on No1 Court sighed in sympathy for Nara, glad that it was her out there and not them. Kvitova was rampant. She is a wonderful player, blowing Nara away in the second set with a barrage of aces and booming forehand winners.</p> \n<p>Kvitova banged down 10 aces overall, one of them coming off a second serve, and Nara found it impossible to read her lefty deliveries. The Czech dropped only nine points on serve, although that was a relative slip in Kvitova’s impeccable standards given that she lost only one against Bertens.</p> \n<p>Yet if her rivals find themselves poring over the match statistics and pick that one out as a potential weakness that can be exploited down the line, they will be clutching at straws.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/2/1435851331643/Petra-Kvitova--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Petra Kvitova was not in the mood for fun and games against the world No57 Kurumi Nara.

It made us all appreciate and understand the importance of engaging with the public.</p> \n<p>“Ultimately we are in the entertainment business and people have a choice whether they turn on cricket on television or go and watch a cricket match or do something different. We’ve got an obligation to make the product one that people want to watch.”</p> \n<p>The last time Strauss sat down in front of the media things looked very different. He was under fire about Kevin Pietersen, for the way the sacking of Peter Moores was handled and in the shadow of England’s disastrous World Cup campaign. Fast forward two months and things could not have really gone any better for him, his decision to back Eoin Morgan as one-day captain has already been vindicated by the attractive limited-overs matches against New Zealand. Strauss is too classy to be smug but in a very short space of time he seems to have achieved at least one of his goals; reconnecting with the English cricket watching public.</p> \n<p>Strauss was speaking at the Kia Oval to promote Cricket for Heroes, an all-star T20 match in which he will playing alongside many other cricketing stars.</p> \n<p>The match is being played to raise money for Help for Heroes and Strauss was keen to remind us, that despite all the pre-Ashes aggression, this is cricket not war.</p> \n<p>“In the context of what we’re talking about today, it makes you realise it’s not about life and death, it’s games of cricket between two very passionate sides who want to desperately win. But I don’t think we need to build it into something it’s not. I think the war rhetoric when it comes to the Ashes is unhelpful.”</p> \n<p>In that vein, Strauss thinks that Bayliss is absolutely perfect for the job. “He won’t take it too seriously but as an Aussie he will be determined to win. He’s a really solid individual who will react well to the pressures that come with the job.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/england-ben-stokes-australia-intimidation-cricket\">England’s Ben Stokes says he can handle any Australian intimidation</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/2/1435857775041/Alastair-Cook-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alastair Cook is going into the Ashes 'in a better frame of mind than he has been for quite a while', said Andrew Strauss.

The tourists may have rested Mitchell Johnson for this final tune-up before Cardiff, yet three of the bowlers who are likely to join him in the team for that first Test were treated with disdain by the Essex batsmen.</p> \n<p>Nathan Lyon, the off-spinner who in a bone-dry summer will hope to make hay against England’s battery of left-handers, suffered especially. At one point during a harrowing opening spell, in which Lyon went for more than 10 runs an over, Westley launched him high over long-on and into the river Can.</p> \n<p>Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood also had moments to forget as Essex ended the day on 299 for three in response to Australia’s first-innings 562.</p> \n<p>Starc, whose left-arm pace partnership with Johnson will be key to Australia’s hopes of ending their 14-year wait for an Ashes series win in England, started with a wide that would have induced a wry smile from Steve Harmison.</p> \n<p>The 25-year-old, dropped for two of the five Tests during an uncomfortable debut Ashes series in 2013, started badly, sending his first ball of the tour in the direction of second slip – precisely how Harmison infamously launched into the 2006-07 Ashes series.</p> \n<p>By the end of the day Starc at least seemed to find rhythm and range, going round the wicket to bowl Westley, the Essex batsman having made 144 during a 214-run second-wicket partnership with Ravi Bopara.</p> \n<p>Bopara, of course, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/27/ravi-bopara-england-ashes-recall\" title=\"\">made a hundred himself against the touring Australians 10 years ago</a>, an innings that launched his international career. Now seemingly out of the reckoning after a harrowing World Cup campaign earlier this year, he at least reminded everyone present why he has played more than 100 games for his country, reaching the close unbeaten on 86.</p> \n<p>The day, though, was Westley’s. “I’ve already got a message from Alastair Cook, he said. Like Graham Gooch and Cooky always speak about, it’s all about getting big hundreds. We were looking to get after spin as well and it worked well today.”</p> \n<p>Westley, who like Cook and Bopara before him has been mentored by Gooch at Essex, has high hopes of emulating those three and playing for England. The 26-year-old’s form last summer, when he scored more than 1700 runs at an average of 55 across all formats, is an indication he may have what it takes.</p> \n<p>Nasser Hussain, another former Essex and England captain, has also been instrumental in the Cambridge-born batsman’s development, although it is Andrew Strauss, who made his international debut at 27, who is Westley’s real inspiration.</p> \n<p>“Playing for England is definitely an ambition of mine,” he said. “Strauss is a bit of a role model because he made it fairly late himself. It just goes to show being grounded in county cricket can be beneficial for going on and representing England.”</p> \n<p>Australia’s labouring in the field against a Division Two County Championship team should be qualified by the fact that this pitch at Chelmsford is flatter than the nearby A12 dual carriageway.</p> \n<p>Mitchell Marsh had starred with a century on day one, which Australia closed on 440 for six, and he was eventually out for 169 yesterday, bowled by seamer Matt Salisbury. He was the ninth Australian batsman to fall and a 73-run last-wicket stand between Lyon and Peter Siddle took the tourists total above 500.</p> \n<p>Lyon, who made 41 from 30 balls, then went on to endure a tougher time with ball in hand, ending the day wicketless and shipping 110 runs from his 19 overs.</p> \n<p>Siddle, unlikely to play in Cardiff, was actually one of the best Australian bowlers on show and he said: “It was a bit of a blowout for the young lads who haven’t played in a few weeks. We were pretty poor with our consistency from both ends.”</p> \n<p>That will be music to English ears.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435865984658/Essexs-Tom-Westley-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Essex's Tom Westley scored a brilliant 144 against Australia and said that, at 26, 'playing for England is definitely an ambition'.

Now at 24, despite having just five Test caps to his name, he could be Michael Clarke’s most potent weapon when hostilities get under way in Cardiff on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>“It’s a great compliment whenever I read my name anywhere near Glenn’s,” said Hazlewood, who bowled 13 economical but wicketless overs on his first outing of the tour, on day two of Australia’s second warm-up match at Chelmsford against Essex.</p> \n<p>“It’s not a burden at all. Glenn’s the best quick Australia has ever had so to be compared to him is pretty exciting,” he added. The connection does not stop there, with Hazlewood having worked under his idol at the MRF Pace Foundation in 2013, a bowling clinic for aspiring quicks in Chennai, India, that boasts Mitchell Johnson and Brett Lee among its overseas alumni. It seems the method by which McGrath was able to claim 157 wickets in 30 Ashes Tests has now been firmly passed on.</p> \n<p>“I’d like to work with him more but in the sessions we’ve had it was pretty simple,” he added. “Hit that spot that the batsman don’t want you to hit, swing it a bit each way and with the odd bouncer. Glenn didn’t have much more to say than that and it is a pretty simple game plan – it’s just about doing it over and over again.”</p> \n<p>Hazlewood is certainly the form fast bowler in the tourists’ attack, arriving in this country from the Caribbean where he picked up a man-of-the-series award for his 12 wickets in two Tests on pitches, as England’s seamers will testify, that do little to encourage their ilk these days. Now, with the prominent seam of the Dukes ball to work with, he is really interested.</p> \n<p>“I’ve heard from others it is suited to these conditions,” he said. “The last couple of weeks I’ve really enjoyed bowling on the English pitches in practice. The ball has swung around. The wickets are a bit slower and most the time I’m trying to hit a length that’s a touch fuller than Australia just to get the maximum swing and I’ve really enjoyed it so far.”</p> \n<p>Is he prepared, in the spirit of McGrath’s 19 dismissals of Mike Atherton, to single out the England captain, Alastair Cook, as the wicket he is targeting above all others this summer? “There’s a couple of key wickets,” he replied. “Joe Root is in outstanding form at the moment and Cook is always very important to get on top of early in each innings. Cook is obviously back in the runs recently. I’ll be talking to our senior bowlers for as much information as I can [about him]. I think full is the length to most of the English batsmen – they sit back and play it late – to try and see as much swing as they can.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435861175820/Cricket---Ashes-Tour-2015-018.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Josh Hazlewood, in action against Essex, is happy to be compared with Australia legend Glenn McGrath.
