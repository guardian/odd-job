The emails, sent just a month before Magness left the Nike Oregon Project in June 2012, show Salazar was happy for Magness to lead sessions in a 10-day period while Salazar was away and to become the coach of the 3,000m steeplechaser Lindsay Allen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/allegations-alberto-salazar-response\">Ten allegations against Alberto Salazar, his response and where this leaves us</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It was Magness who made the most serious allegations against Salazar and Galen Rupp, the 10,000m silver medallist at London 2012 – including claims that Rupp had used testosterone as a 16-year-old and that Salazar had tested testosterone gel on his son, Alex, to see how much could be used without breaking anti-doping rules. But while the two men have fallen out spectacularly, emails sent in May 2012 suggest Salazar still respected and trusted his No2.</p> \n<p>In one email, sent on 8 May, Salazar tells Magness: “I just spoke with Lindsay and I think that’s a great idea for you to take over her coaching. I was trying to move to that eventually but didn’t want Lindsay to think that I didn’t want to coach her. She needs to train with other top woman runners to fulfil her potential. With Tara [Erdmann] hopefully coming in you will have three women all training together. If you injure her, I will kill you. Ha ha! See you both on Friday.”</p> \n<p>Salazar’s joke shows that he is a much more rounded character than his critics, who tend to focus on his intense, win-at-all-costs mentality, appreciated. At the same time, they call into question his account in his open letter in which he is deeply critical of Magness. In it he wrote: “Magness lacked the personality, inter-personal skills and drive to be able to coach elite athletes. He appeared to be intimidated by them and he retreated. He could not run a practice session by himself. He appeared to be unable to motivate the athletes as they ran or observe them. Ultimately, my top runners refused to work with him.”</p> \n<p>But another email from Salazar in early May – which was sent to David Hendry, the strength and conditioning coach at the Nike Oregon Project, and Darren Treasure, the high performance sports consultant – told them: “I’m going to stay with Matthew [Centrowitz] in Portland and keep him motivated. Steve knows the guys good enough that I have complete confidence he’ll take care of all of them.”</p> \n<p>As Magness said in a statement sent to the Guardian: “it seems strange that he would hand over his star athletes for 10 days leading up to the Olympic trials and say that he has ‘complete confidence’ in my ability to look after them if he felt what he now claims about my abilities as a coach. That doesn’t fit the narrative Salazar is currently attempting to weave.”</p> \n<p>Meanwhile Dr Jeffrey Brown, the doctor who Salazar says carried out tests to ensure his athletes were not sabotaged by testosterone cream, also appeared to dispute his claims. In an interview with the US news website ProPublica, which cooperated with Panorama, Brown said he had not prescribed a controlled substance for Salazar’s sons or other research subjects as part of an experiment.</p> \n<p>“No, absolutely not,” Brown said. “I didn’t do that, and would not do that. I would never do that.” He said that he was merely advising Salazar on how to conduct research on potential sabotage “in a hypothetical situation”. He said that Salazar’s exploration of potential testosterone sabotage was admirable.Brown also denied claims that he had prescribed the thyroid medication Cytomel to Kara Goucher in 2011 for her weight loss, telling ProPublica that while he could not discuss individual patients, “I would never, ever give somebody Cytomel for weight loss, ever”. The massage therapist John Stiner also insisted he was telling the truth when he revealed that Salazar had told him he was taking AndroGel, a banned testosterone gel, for his heart. Salazar had claimed that he told him it was for energy but Stiner told ProPublica: “I told 100% the truth. I’ll take 20 lie detector tests.Of course he said I’m lying.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-statement-nike-steve-magness-mo-farah-bbc-panorama-claims\">Alberto Salazar rebuttal: starting pistol for a race heading for the courts</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However Salazar received a glowing endorsement from Greg and Jamie Rupp, the parents of Galen Rupp, who said that he had been like “a second father” to their son. “I was very jealous of Alberto for a little while when Galen was in high school,” said Greg Rupp. “He would tell Galen to do something, and Galen would hop to it.

And on.</p> \n<p>As Salazar released his two-part open letter on the NOP website, the sportswear brand that has bankrolled his money-no-object attempt to take on the world of endurance running put out its own co-ordinated statement.</p> \n<p>It is three weeks since the BBC’s Panorama and the ProPublica website in the US first made their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/03/mo-farah-training-camp-documentary-alleged-drug-use-alberto-salazar-\" title=\"\">claims against Salazar</a> and his protege Galen Rupp, the London 2012 silver medallist who is Mo Farah’s training partner.</p> \n<p>After three weeks spent silently plotting and gathering evidence, Salazar went on the attack accusing the BBC and ProPublica of a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-issues-denial-doping-statement\" title=\"\">“remarkable display of irresponsible journalism”</a>.</p> \n<p>With both organisations standing by their claims, underpinned by testimony from a list of witnesses now approaching 20, and the BBC in particular launching a strong defence of its journalism, it is a dispute that looks to be heading for the law courts, most probably in the US.</p> \n<p>Almost as soon as Salazar had released his statement – complete with its defiant Taylor Swift (or Adidas) channelling “let the haters hate” coda - his accusers were already challenging it with their own new assertions and evidence.</p> \n<p>So Salazar painted <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-defence-doctor-magness-emails\" title=\"\">Steve Magness</a>, one of the key whistleblowers, as an embittered ex-employee who was sacked. Magness responded with a signed document showing the contract had been terminated by mutual agreement.</p> \n<p>The Cuba-born coach pointed to a 2011 Runners World interview in which Magness raised no objection to his methods. Magness said he was still employed by Nike at the time and afraid to speak out.</p> \n<p>Salazar’s statement can either underpin suspicion or absolve it, depending on your starting position. Viewed cynically, it answers some charges in detail that were not made and skirts over others that were.</p> \n<p>Some passages are supported by detailed documentary and supplementary evidence, others are not. Even its mix of corporate legalese and occasional impassioned personal invective can feel a bit too carefully crafted – as though pored over for weeks by lawyers and PR consultants.</p> \n<p>There are unavoidable, and for Salazar unhelpful, echoes of Armstrong in the mix of aggression and frenzied detail – from Rupp’s “Shawshank Redemption” description of the method of getting legal medicine through customs hidden inside a paperback to a physician called Dr Thing – that underpins the statement.</p> \n<p>Yet for his supporters, the lengthy rebuttal will be seen as exactly what his accusers have been asking for. If you are Mo Farah, with a world championship looming and an Olympics next summer, it is likely to more than provide the “answers” he says he has been seeking since the original broadcast plunged him into a PR nightmare. As the likes of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/20/mo-farah-witch-hunt-steve-cram\" title=\"\">Steve Cram have rallied around</a>, he will also feel he has the support of his peers.</p> \n<p>So the most likely outcome of the ongoing UK Athletics review – expected to report by August ahead of the world championships – is that it will cut its formal ties with Salazar while making no judgment as to the validity of the allegations against him, perhaps citing the unwelcome distraction that the arrangement has become as the Rio Olympics loom.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, if Farah retains Salazar as his coach he will do so in the knowledge that he is taking a long-term risk with his reputation and legacy if the claims are later proved.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/allegations-alberto-salazar-response\">Ten allegations against Alberto Salazar, his response and where this leaves us</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As an aside, it was notable that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/chris-froome-missed-drug-test-tour-de-france\" title=\"\">Chris Froome</a> (or his PR handlers) chose to come clean about his own missed tests – presumably so they could be disclosed on his terms rather than by the press. If one byproduct of the latest sorry saga to sully the reputation of athletics is more transparency on testing then that would at least be one small positive.</p> \n<p>Now that the fuse has been lit by the BBC and ProPublica claims, this affair is likely to be a slow burning one that could yet result in multiple casualties. Meanwhile, confirmation that Usada - and its determined chief executive Travis Tygart - are continuing to investigate is just another sign that none of this is going away and another inevitable echo of the Armstrong affair.</p> \n<p>As claim and counter-claim mount up over the specifics, nor should it stop broader questions being asked about the training culture within American colleges or a prevailing performance methodology that praises “marginal gains”, secrecy and the appliance of science in a game that virtually encourages the rules to be bent until they break.</p> \n<p>As both sides dig in, exchanges of fire are likely to continue. In the meantime, Farah faces perhaps the biggest call of his career - stick or twist.</p> \n<p>The Oregon Project webstore features Farah and Rupp staring defiantly at the lens, clad in the team’s regulation all black regalia. If they stick with Salazar, as they appear increasingly likely to do, they will have to stare down plenty more besides over the coming months and years.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435257568712/Albeto-Salazar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar at the 14th IAAF World Championships in Athletics at the Luzhniki Stadium Photograph: Today Sports/Rex Shutterstock","credit":"Today Sports/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Albeto Salazar","cleanCaption":"Alberto Salazar at the 14th IAAF World Championships in Athletics at the Luzhniki Stadium Photograph: Today Sports/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T18:52:52Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T23:45:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Owen Gibson","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682464138/Owen-Gibson-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/owengibson"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Alberto Salazar","Athletics","Sport","US sports"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/alberto-salazar","webTitle":"Alberto Salazar"},{"id":"sport/athletics","webTitle":"Athletics"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Owen Gibson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/owengibson"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-statement-nike-steve-magness-mo-farah-bbc-panorama-claims","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a623","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-statement-nike-steve-magness-mo-farah-bbc-panorama-claims","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/25/alberto-salazar-statement-nike-steve-magness-mo-farah-bbc-panorama-claims"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435257568712/Albeto-Salazar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar at the 14th IAAF World Championships in Athletics at the Luzhniki Stadium Photograph: Today Sports/Rex Shutterstock","credit":"Today Sports/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Albeto Salazar","cleanCaption":"Alberto Salazar at the 14th IAAF World Championships in Athletics at the Luzhniki Stadium Photograph: Today Sports/Rex Shutterstock"}},"importance":0,"kicker":{"title":"Comment"},"byline":{"title":"Owen Gibson"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"cutout","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/21/1400682464138/Owen-Gibson-L.png"}}]}],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435251380798/Alberto-Salazar-in-2012-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar in February 2012, four months before he terminated the contract of Steve Magness.

So that was a hugely frustrating situation for me.”</p> \n<p>Under the whereabouts system, designed to support out-of-competition testing, cyclists are obliged to inform officials where they will be for a specific hour between 5am and 11pm when they are obliged to be available for testing.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457268700__\n</div> \n<p>Most nominate a time early in the morning, as it is when they are most certain of their likely whereabouts: at home in bed. While Froome had logged his temporary holiday address on the whereabouts website, he neglected to let hotel staff know he may have callers who should be granted immediate access to his room.</p> \n<p>“I did appeal to try and explain the circumstances to the authorities but at the end of the day I take full responsibility for that case,” said Froome, who has previously claimed to have been tested more than 30 times in one three-week period.</p> \n<p>“I should have been more proactive in letting the hotel know this was a possibility that I could be tested. I’ve certainly learned my lesson there. I’ve stayed in hotels all over the world and I’ve been tested all over the world without any issues at all. Unfortunately I just didn’t see this one coming but it’s opened my eyes and I’m definitely going to be more pro-active in the future. It’s always the athlete’s responsibility to make sure he or she is available for testing.”</p> \n<p>The World Anti-Doping Agency operates a three-strike policy that means anyone who misses three tests in a 12-month period is deemed to have committed an anti-doping rule violation and incurs an automatic ban of up to two years.</p> \n<p>Despite the recent blot on his copybook, Froome is pleased with what he sees as a more rigorous approach to drug testing in cycling.</p> \n<p>Last year he observed that neither he, nor his high-profile Tour de France rivals Vincenzo Nibali and Alberto Contador, had been asked to undergo drug controls during lengthy spells of altitude training in Tenerife.</p> \n<p>“As far as I can see that has been rectified,” he said. “This year, up in Tenerife alone, I think we were tested at least three or four times during the period when we were up there. So yes, I think the authorities have acted on that.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435178957279/The-2013-Tour-de-France-w-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The 2013 Tour de France winner Chris Froome is one of the favourites to win this year's race.

Mings has agreed personal terms with the Premier League club after Bournemouth beat off competition from Aston Villa, West Bromwich Albion and Newcastle United and the left-back will sign a four-year contract at the Goldsands Stadium, subject to him passing a medical.</p> \n<p>It is understood that Ryan Fraser, the former Aberdeen winger, is moving to Portman Road on loan as part of the deal. While there has been no shortage of interest in Mings, who cost Ipswich only &pound;10,000 when they signed him from non-league Chippenham Town in December 2012, Bournemouth’s willingness to meet the Championship club’s valuation of the player propelled them to the front of queue.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/dec/18/tyrone-mings-ipswich\">Tyrone Mings makes his mark at Ipswich on and off the pitch | Stuart James</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Mings was given permission to talk to Bournemouth and travelled to the south coast on Wednesday night to hold talks with Eddie Howe on Thursday morning. He was hugely impressed with Howe and believes that the Bournemouth manager will help to develop his talent as part of the next step in a career that has gone from strength to strength ever since he gave up work as a mortgage adviser two and a half years ago.</p> \n<p>Rejected by Southampton at the age of 16, Mings was turning out for Chippenham Town and driving a Citro&euml;n Saxo that cost him &pound;100 when Ipswich offered him a trial in December 2012. Mick McCarthy, the Ipswich manager, liked what he saw and the five-figure sum the Championship club paid Chippenham for Mings must rank as one of their best investments.</p> \n<p>Mings, who is 6ft 5in, blessed with a good left foot and is a fine athlete, blossomed under McCarthy’s watch and attracted attention from leading Premier League clubs, including Arsenal and Chelsea, where his father, Adie, works as a scout. Crystal Palace had a &pound;3m bid for Mings rejected last September and the player’s value continued to climb during a season in which Ipswich reached the play-off semi-finals before losing to Norwich.</p> \n<p>Howe has watched Mings’s progress closely and the Bournemouth board backed his judgment to make a move for a player who was coveted by a number of their top-flight rivals only for them to be discouraged by the price put on his head.</p> \n<p>As well as catching the eye with his performances on the pitch at Portman Road, Mings has picked up a reputation for being something of a good Samaritan in the world of football, with various gestures of goodwill, including one act of kindness that made him national news before he had made his debut for Ipswich.</p> \n<p>In March 2013 Mings exchanged tweets with an Ipswich supporter who could not afford to go their home match against Bolton because he was “skint”. Mings replied on Twitter and said that he would leave his complimentary tickets at Portman Road for the fan to collect. The exchange between the two went viral.</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Guardian in December, Mings talked about how much enjoyment he got from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/dec/18/tyrone-mings-ipswich\" title=\"\">spending Christmas Day in 2013 feeding the homeless in Ipswich</a>.

The pair of them, both England internationals and with Premier League winners’ medals in their collections, had gone to Italy last summer with optimism, enthusiasm, goodwill and not a little intrigue – it’s not as if English players regularly trade home comforts for the challenge of an overseas adventure.</p> \n<p>It is deflating to acknowledge how their Italian trips fizzled out so soon. It remains a peculiarity – a foible that’s a little weird to be honest – that England seems to be the one country that does not easily export footballers. Yes, Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard – finally – are due to experience their American dream in MLS. The absence of an English player in his prime trying his luck at an elite European club, however, goes on. It is around about a decade since Real Madrid took David Beckham, Steve McManaman and Michael Owen to La Liga. Since then, not so much of substance.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report\">England 1-3 Italy | Under-21 European Championship match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Does it really matter? While the Premier League is awash with money and possesses a glitzy enough reputation of its own, does it have significance beyond a player’s personal choice where he chooses to live and work? That question brings to mind the long-held opinions of a couple of World Cup-winning grandees.</p> \n<p>The Brazillian Carlos Alberto Parreira, who won the World Cup in 1994 and coached the national team in three different decades, noted the impact exporting players had on the sele&ccedil;&atilde;o. Talking in 2002, he was convinced the tactical discipline Brazil’s most naturally gifted magicians gained in Europe was key. With Ronaldo then at Internazionale, Rivaldo at Barcelona and Ronaldinho at Paris Saint-Germain, their experiences at club level armed them with qualities to help them best express their talent in international competition.</p> \n<p>Four years earlier, a similar message came from France’s World Cup-winning coach, Aim&eacute; Jacquet. It was considered a major plus point in the characteristics of the squad that so many key influences played outside the French league. Zinedine Zidane, Didier Deschamps and Marcel Desailly were all in Serie A during its glory years, Bixente Lizarazu played for Bayern Munich, Patrick Vieira for Arsenal, Christian Karembeu for Real Madrid. The lessons they all absorbed and brought back to Les Bleus’ party were regarded as vital.</p> \n<p>For both France in 1998 and Brazil in 2002, it was the mix between the traditional qualities and style of the national team, and the international nous gained by its brightest sparks, that provided the important click at those World Cups.</p> \n<p>With that in mind, have a look at the current Fifa world rankings. England are 15th. Now guess the only country in that top 15 that does not currently export a single international player – the clue is somewhere in this paragraph, if you do not get it straight away for some reason.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/football-zip/giv-21277zpKVI0Tlq2g4/\" data-alt=\"Graphic\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/06/football-zip/giv-21277zpKVI0Tlq2g4/\">Graphic</a> \n <figcaption>\n  Current figures show England’s players as the least well-travelled of the major footballing nations.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Not that exporting players is the be-all-and end-all. As it happens, apart from England, the closest to a fully home-playing squad is Italy and then Germany, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jul/13/germany-argentina-world-cup-final-2014-match-report\">the current World Cup holders</a>, who have the next fewest number of players at clubs outside their domestic league based on most recent international squads. Those figures could have been greater, incidentally, had the likes of Toni Kroos for Germany and Marco Verratti or Thiago Motta for Italy, been selected.</p> \n<p>Generally speaking, the vast majority of highest-ranking teams contain an abundance of players plying their trade overseas. There is one pretty compelling reason for this. The resources of the Argentinian or Belgian league, for example, and the salaries they offer, are incomparable with those of the big hitters in Europe. The impulse for the best Argentinians or Belgians to flock to a bigger, richer league is obvious. They exported 21 and 18 players respectively according to their most recent squads, the overwhelming majority.</p> \n<p>Not only do they better themselves technically, playing with and against a higher calibre of player than they would domestically, they also have to develop personally to undertake the many challenges of living, working and integrating successfully away from home.</p> \n<p>Chris “Magic” Waddle, as he was known during his spell in France with Marseille between 1989 and 1992, passionately believes the experience of challenging yourself as a person and a footballer in a foreign league can be seminal. He says young players at Premier League clubs who are regularly sent out on loan should spend some time in Holland, Germany, France or wherever, discovering a new type of football and, quite possibly, learning a bit about themselves, too.</p> \n<p>Is it a coincidence that England’s best World Cup performance since 1966 came in 1990, the period when it was more regular for coveted English talent to go abroad? From that team, as well as Waddle, Gary Lineker, Paul Gascoigne, David Platt and Des Walker all signed for foreign clubs. Glenn Hoddle, who did not make that squad, was strutting his stuff in France at the time.</p> \n<p>Today England wakes up with a familiar feeling in the aftermath of an international tournament flunk – a knockout cocktail of frustration, confusion, disappointment and blame. Now that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/england-under-21-italy-european-championship-match-report\">England’s latest band of under-21s</a> have had their proper initiation into how things are, it is time to march back to the drawing board, yet again, to wonder how to solve this syndrome of repetitive disillusionment.</p> \n<p>The latest analysis masterminded by Greg Dyke at the Football Association points to quotas and a bid to increase playing time for young players by insisting on upping the number of home-growns in each Premier League squad <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/23/greg-dyke-fa-overseas-player-quotas\">from eight to 12</a>.</p> \n<p>Perhaps this is barking up the wrong tree, however. Encouraging English players to see some action cannot be a bad thing but it is the type of action they see that is arguably where the real fascination lies.</p> \n<p>It is hard to envisage how either the FA, or the clubs themselves, can be expected to encourage players to choose the unknown; an adventure, a risk, instead of the familiar, the safe, and the Premier League megabucks. It may not be the answer to everything anyway. It is difficult not to wonder, however, if England’s singularity when it comes to exporting players is connected in some way to the catalogue of international letdowns.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435241697925/ccaf332a-8cc3-42ef-96fd-df11d3fc0914-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Luciano Rossi/AS Roma via Getty Images","altText":"Ashley Cole, left, has had a mixed time at Roma and  Micah Richards’s loan spell at Fiorentina from Manchester City fell flat","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Luciano Rossi/AS Roma via Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T11:07:06Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T14:18:26Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":821,"contributors":[{"name":"Amy Lawrence","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/8/21/1408638591823/Amy-Lawrence-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/amylawrence"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Premier League","European club football","Ashley Cole","England","The FA","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League"},{"id":"football/europeanfootball","webTitle":"European club football"},{"id":"football/ashley-cole","webTitle":"Ashley Cole"},{"id":"football/england","webTitle":"England"},{"id":"football/fa","webTitle":"The FA"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Amy Lawrence","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/amylawrence"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/25/englishman-abroad-football-export-michah-richards-ashley-cole-serie-a-england","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a5ck","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/blog/2015/jun/25/englishman-abroad-football-export-michah-richards-ashley-cole-serie-a-england","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jun/25/englishman-abroad-football-export-michah-richards-ashley-cole-serie-a-england"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435241697925/ccaf332a-8cc3-42ef-96fd-df11d3fc0914-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ashley Cole, left, has had a mixed time at Roma and Micah Richards’s loan spell at Fiorentina from Manchester City fell flat.

Italy opted not to pick Milan’s Mattia De Sciglio and Stephan El Shaarawy, PSG’s Marco Verratti or Genoa’s goalkeeper Mattia Perin. Germany could have had Mario G&ouml;tze in their squad if they so wished. Serbia went without Matija Nastasic, Lazar Markovic and Aleksandar Mitrovic. No country opted to sacrifice the developmental side of the tournament on the altar of success although it is interesting that the four sides to reach the semi-finals are the four with the most senior internationals in their squad.</p> \n<p>To have tried to bring in Jack Wilshere, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Phil Jones, Raheem Sterling et al would simply have served to open old debates. Gareth Southgate’s predecessor as head coach, Stuart Pearce, seemed constantly at war during his tenure with the clubs over player availability and grumbled about player commitment. Whatever else could be thrown at the players in this squad, a lack of desire was not an issue and the buildup was not dominated by the absentee debate, even if the postmortem has been.</p> \n<p>The concern then is not so much about those who were not here but more about the experience of those who were. Of the 23-man England squad only five – Carl Jenkinson, Stones, James Ward-Prowse, Harry Kane and Ings – could be considered Premier League regulars last season, with the rest of the squad made up of top-flight bit-part players and Championship stalwarts. In the aftermath both Southgate and Dan Ashworth, the FA’s director of elite development, pinpointed that lack of big‑game exposure as a key failing.</p> \n<p>But it is an almost impossible puzzle to solve. “Young players will make mistakes” has been something of a mantra here and while that is true, the burden for those mistakes falls on the national side. Chelsea are not going to allow Nathaniel Chalobah a season to learn the ropes at the base of their midfield any more than Liam Moore can expect a regular spot at the heart of the Leicester City defence – the stakes for Premier League clubs and managers at both ends of the spectrum are just too high.</p> \n<p>The exposure argument stacks up only so far, too. Italy’s third goal came from a throw-in by Stefano Sabelli, of the Serie B side Bari, which was hooked on by Marcello Trotta, once of Fulham and Barnsley and now of Serie B’s Avellino, and nodded home by Marco Benassi, who played fewer than half of Torino’s games as they finished ninth in Serie A. Sweden’s squad of semi-finalists contains players from Groningen, Halmstads and the Turkish side Mersin Idmanyurdu.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/25/england-under-21s-gareth-southgate-european-championship\">England Under-21s: How Gareth Southgate and his players rated at the European Championship</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The two sides who buck that trend, though, have been Germany, who are stocked with Bundesliga regulars, and Portugal, who in their ranks boast seven players who played Champions League football in 2014-15; they have been widely considered the best two sides at the tournament. A CIES Football Observatory study before the tournament found that between 2009‑10 and 2013-14 players eligible for the Under-21 international football <a href=\"http://www.football-observatory.com/IMG/pdf/wp113_eng.pdf\">played around double the minutes</a> of their Serie A and Premier League counterparts, although the gap was narrower in 2014-15.</p> \n<p>For England there remain a few straws at which to clutch.

The British No1 is hungry to learn both about her chosen profession and the world that exists beyond the baseline grind.</p> \n<p>“I absolutely loved school,” Watson says, suddenly sounding like she is in a job interview. “I don’t think many people say that but you have all your friends there, you’re learning, you’re having fun. I really enjoyed it.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/eugenie-bouchard-aegon-international-retires\">Eugenie Bouchard retires hurt but says ‘I’ll play Wimbledon on one leg’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Watson has an inquisitive mind. Perhaps that is not surprising. Tennis players are always thinking, even when it looks as if they are acting on instinct alone. Sometimes it must appear that way to them when they are playing. The speed of the exchanges compels them to react in split-second moments which can make it seem as though the thought process is nonexistent, yet their brains are constantly whirring, telling them which shots to hit at different pointsin a rally, and straining to keep negative thoughts at bay when the chips are down.</p> \n<p>During Watson’s swift <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/24/johanna-konta-beats-garbine-muguruza-eastbourne\" title=\"\">6-2, 6-3 defeat to Sloane Stephens</a> in the third round of the Aegon Open on Wednesday the importance of positivity was clear. When Watson twice dropped her serve to trail 3-0 after 10 one-sided minutes she must have feared that Stephens would bagel her. It could have happened. Stephens, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/28/heather-watson-sloane-stephens-french-open\" title=\"\">who beat Watson in the French Open last month</a>, was threatening to devour her.</p> \n<p>In her first two matches Watson scrapped to wins over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/heather-watson-varvara-lepchenko-eastbourne\" title=\"\">Varvara Lepchenko</a>, the world No38, and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/jo-konta-beats-ekaterina-makarova-eastbourne\" title=\"\">Elina Svitolina</a>, the world No17. This time her battling instincts could not save her against an opponent who now has two wins over her this summer but at least Watson could tell herself that she refused to fold. Although it does not look like much to the naked eye, especially with Wimbledon starting on Monday, it could be something to build on.</p> \n<p>Watson is interested in psychology. “I’ve always thought about taking up a college course while I’m on the road, just to keep my mind going, but I actually haven’t done it yet,” she says. “Tennis does keep me quite busy. I was very interested in psychology at school. Maybe later on something in finance, even though that sounds quite boring.”</p> \n<p>As Watson grows older, she is becoming wiser.</p> \n<p>She has learnt from her past mistakes and knows that she returned too soon after she had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/apr/03/british-no2-heather-watson-glandular-fever\" title=\"\">glandular fever two years ago</a>. Having reached the third round of Wimbledon in 2012, losing to the eventual finalist <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/jun/29/heather-watson-agnieszka-radwanska-live\" title=\"\">Agnieszka Radwanska</a>, she lost badly to Madison Keys in the first round.</p> \n<p>“I came back too soon,” she says. “I wasn’t fully better yet. I was just desperate to come back. I didn’t want to miss a slam or anything like that. Last year when I had the rib or shoulder injury, I missed one of my favourite tournaments of the year in Estoril because I knew it wasn’t right. You have to be patient, even though it sucks. It took me a while and I lost a bit of confidence because I wasn’t winning matches straight off the bat and I expected myself to. I just had to be patient and really fight my way back.” Despite Watson’s defeat to Stephens this is a promising era for women’s tennis in Britain, with Laura Robson back from the injury that has kept her out for 17 months and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/23/jo-konta-beats-ekaterina-makarova-eastbourne\" title=\"\">Johanna Konta wowing the crowds in Eastbourne</a>.</p> \n<p>Watson has slipped to 64th in the world but she is resolute in her belief that she can be a top-20 player one day. Although she has never been past the third round of a grand slam, the 23-year-old is still developing.</p> \n<p>“I think I’m kind of a late bloomer,” she says. “I did well in the juniors but later on, towards the end. Even in my career, I’ve had a few hiccups. I haven’t had amazing results and then terrible ones,I’ve just been gradually climbing my way up. I think I definitely have the tennis for it. I need to keep working on my mind and help that bring it out.”</p> \n<p>Watson says she remembers all of her matches, even when she was in the juniors, and she recalls going to Wimbledon as a little girl.</p> \n<p>“I went there once actually,” she says. “My mum’s friend from Guernsey had two tickets that year and she could have brought anybody but she told my mum: ‘Look, I’ll take Heather.’ She took me there and it was for the semi-finals. It was Venus Williams against … I can’t remember.” That probably annoyed her.“I was about seven or eight and it’s amazing that Venus is still playing and I can say I’ve played on tour against her,” she continues. “Just seeing it, I remember telling her: ‘I’m gonna play here one day,’ and everybody’s like: ‘Yeah, OK, Heather.’ To be playing there now, I’m just so pleased.”</p> \n<p>The Wimbledon draw is on Friday and Watson will find out who she is playing in the first round in her own time. Then she will focus. “That’s the tournament I want to do best in,” Watson says. “I always look forward to it. I really, really, really want to do well there this year.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435268844578/Heather-Watson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"British No1 Heather Watson is eager to improve her record at Wimbledon.
