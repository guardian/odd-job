Firmino has scored 47 goals in 151 appearances during his four and a half years in Germany and has scored four times in nine international caps, including <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/brazil-venezuela-copa-america-match-report\">Sunday’s Copa Am&eacute;rica winner against Venezuela</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/steven-gerrard-liverpool-slip-chelsea-premier-league-title\">Steven Gerrard still haunted by slip after leaving Liverpool without winning title</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Liverpool are likely to have to pay an initial &pound;25m with further fees taking that total nearer &pound;29m, which would make it the second largest transfer in their history – behind the &pound;35m signing of Andy Carroll.</p> \n<p>The club have taken steps to smooth the third-party ownership issues that would have prevented Firmino moving to England.

The forward can lead the line as a lone striker but will more naturally operate as a No10, a creator as well as scorer.

A THING HAS HAPPENED!</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/liverpool-announce-roberto-firmino-signing-brazil-hoffenheim\">Liverpool announce &pound;29m signing of Brazil’s Roberto Firmino</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Well, actually it hasn’t quite happened yet, Liverpool have just said it has happened. Or that it is about to happen. Or will happen when Firmino has been probed and prodded with something cold and metallic and has completed his medical. So now we pause for you to get incredibly worked up about the fee (around &pound;29m, if you believe the nose-tappers in the know) for a player you hadn’t heard of until three weeks ago unless you’re one of those dorks who watches football outside of Super Duper Mega Sky Bantz With Jamie’s Jamie And Thierry Sunday. Cool.</p> \n<p>Here’s more of what could be called a thing happening. After <strong>Milan</strong> had their pants pulled right down to their ankles <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/internazionale-sign-geoffrey-kondogbia-monaco\">by neighbours Inter over Geoffrey Kondogbia</a>, it looks like they’ve been gazumped again, this time by <strong>Atl&eacute;tico Madrid</strong> for the striker <strong>Jackson Mart&iacute;nez</strong>, with the Colombian set to move from Porto, according to his agent who apologised with the philosophical musing that you “can’t be in two places at once.” Of course this is being spun as a <strong>snub</strong> for Arsenal, despite little suggestion that they were ever really terribly interested in Mart&iacute;nez, or indeed a striker of any stripe. </p> \n<p>Anyway, back to ephemera, and according to whispers in Spain, Manchester United have another suitor for their wayward winger <strong>&Aacute;ngel Di Mar&iacute;a</strong>, purchased last year at great expense but now seemingly on his way out of England in a sack. And that sack has a little tag on it, the sending address reading ‘FC Barcelona, Camp Nou, Camp Nou Mews, 1 Barcelona Street, Barcelona, \n <strike>\n   Spain \n </strike> Cataluyna.’ No postcode though, so it might not get there for a bit. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, emissaries from Chelsea and Stoke have been meeting over a bowl of chips at the Daventry Harvester (we’re guessing – it’s roughly equidistant between London and Stoke, and they do a fine bowl of chips) <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/chelsea-victor-moses-stoke-asmir-begovic\">to discuss the transfer of <strong>Asmir Begovic</strong></a>, and a solemn air has descended over proceedings. For the party from the Potteries have just made their demands, pausing and adopting a serious tone before saying something like: “Now, if these talks are to continue, we must make clear what we want. As well as the &pound;8m, we have to insist that you include … [dramatic, portentous pause] <strong>Victor Moses</strong> in the deal as well.” To which the Chelsea officials presumably tried not to crack a grin, nodded sagely, looked at each other like <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2012/feb/28/seth-johnson-england\">Seth Johnson and his agent when faced with Peter Ridsdale</a>*, sucked in their teeth, briefly made noises about those being tough terms before finally admitting: “We’re sure we can work something out.” Should that price be just too steep for Chelsea, Stoke are keen on <strong>Yevhen Konoplyanka </strong>to fill one of their wing slots.</p> \n<p>Steve McClaren has barely had time to locate the umbrella rack at Newcastle before cracking out the cheque-book, and according to the ever-infallible word on the street, he’s going to scribble out a big fat one, to the tune of &pound;14m, for QPR’s <strong>Charlie Austin</strong>. Whether Austin himself will want to swap one tin repository for another is another question entirely. Elsewhere in the north east, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/sunderland-offer-psv-georginio-wijnaldum\">Sunderland are going to spend &pound;11m on </a><strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/sunderland-offer-psv-georginio-wijnaldum\">Georginio Wijnaldum</a>, </strong>a thought most depressing for any PSV or indeed Dutch fans out there; you can take it when Manchester United prove too much of a draw for Memphis Depay, but when Sunderland are sashaying away with your best players … eesh. The Mackems, however, haven’t had such luck with a &pound;5m bid for <strong>Stewart Downing</strong>, rejected by West Ham, who themselves will <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/marseille-dimitri-payet-west-ham-contract\">guff &pound;12m on Marseille’s </a><strong><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/marseille-dimitri-payet-west-ham-contract\">Dimitri Payet</a> </strong>and have told <strong>Andy Carroll</strong> that he ain’t goin’ nowhere, potentially in the form of a mournful country song.</p> \n<p>It’s decision day for<strong> Mo Salah</strong>, who will tell Chelsea of his intentions towards them at some point in the next 24 hours, so stand by your beds for that one, while former Blue <strong>Demba Ba</strong> will turn his nose up at the prospect of mega coin with Shanghai Shenhua in favour of a move to <strong>West Brom</strong>, which is the sort of club/player combo that makes so much sense you have to quickly nip to Wikipedia to double-check it hasn’t already happened.</p> \n<p>Finally, to end on a big, crashing bang, it says here that <strong>Watford</strong> want <strong>Paulinho</strong> from Spurs. BANG!</p> \n<p>*Yes, we know that’s apocryphal.

I don’t want anyone to get contaminated accidentally.’ My thought was: if you are taking testosterone for yourself there are so many ways you can do it. You can do it in a tablet form. You can do it injection form. You can do it in an implant. So why risk something that could possibly contaminate the athlete? That is nuts. But then we would say, it’s his way. That’s Alberto.</p> \n<p>“It was one of those things that was so common that we didn’t really take notice of it. We would just think he’s got his damned Androgel again.”</p> \n<p>The Guardian received no response when it put Kupczak’s claim to Salazar via email. However it is known he is preparing a detailed rebuttal to a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/03/mo-farah-training-camp-documentary-alleged-drug-use-alberto-salazar-\" title=\"\">Panorama documentary</a> that claimed he gave Rupp testosterone when the athlete was 16 and committed several other doping violations.

Given the time and effort the BBC and ProPublica committed to making these false allegations I hope that media and fans will afford me a short time to show the accusers are knowingly making false statements.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak, who also worked at the Oregon Project for a few months in 2006, also told the Guardian of a culture “where inhalers were so prevalent, it didn’t even faze me if people had one”. Yet in Kupczak’s view that culture became increasing secretive after he returned in 2008 and had become worse by 2011, by which time Farah had joined the camp.</p> \n<p>“When I first met Alberto in 2006 he was great,” he said. “He was fun. He was open. He would help anyone. He was a good man. He gets some wild ideas – he would want to fly to altitude to do a workout and it would happen, or he would order some laser for $20,000 that is worthless. He would do crazy things like that. As a therapist it was fun. I was like, what crazy stuff will we come up with next? But when I went back in 2008 he had changed. And he continued changing by the week. Things got really secretive.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/14/john-rohatinsky-backs-drug-allegations-alberto-salazar\">John Rohatinsky backs drug allegations made against Alberto Salazar</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kupczak, the latest former employee of Nike’s Oregon Project to come forward with claims against Salazar – the tally now stands at nearly 20 – also said he spoke to Usada three years ago. “I wanted to alert them before the Olympics because I thought they could watch more closely or do something about it. I probably contacted them in June 2012, and I spoke to them later in that month.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak believes that, in the next few days, Salazar will try to discredit Goucher, the 2007 10,000m world championship bronze medallist, and Steve Magness, an assistant at the Nike Oregon Project, who made some of the more serious accusations against him in the Panorama documentary. Kupczak said he can vouch for his former colleagues’ testimony and character.</p> \n<p>“I absolutely believe Kara,” he said. “I trust completely that she is honest. And Steve has complete integrity. He’s such a science guy that he wants to do it the proper way. Doping, in his mind, would take away from his science and his research.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak expects that, when Salazar issues his reply to the BBC, there will confusion in the athletics world with people unsure who is telling the truth. He believes the best way to cut through the impasse would be for Usada – or another official body – to start interviewing every member of the Nike Oregon Project under oath.</p> \n<p>“I would love to see that,” Kupczak said. “That is always when it comes out because you can’t lie because if you do you’ll have perjury charges. I would love to see all this come under oath, let’s do it. They always catch you. They always do.</p> \n<p>“If it was anyone else but Alberto they would say: ‘Enough is enough, we have heard this from enough people.’ It’s similar to the Lance Armstrong case, where they didn’t have any positive tests but they had enough witnesses that they said you’re done.”</p> \n<p>Kupczak said the bond between Salazar and Rupp was so close the coach would sometimes take over the massage duties from him when they were at training camps. “Sometimes we’d be somewhere and Galen likes his massages in the evening, so I would start to work on him and Alberto would say: ‘Al, you take the night off, I’ll give Galen a massage.’</p> \n<p>“At first I was a little taken aback. I was thinking am I doing a good job? But then I realised they have a peculiar arrangement, it’s beyond son and father, like some people say, so I’d just laugh it off and think I’ve got the night off, good.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435068872584/Alberto-Salazar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alberto Salazar takes timings during the Prefontaine Classic track and field meet in Eugene, Ore.

It’s been wonderful early-summer fun. England’s high-throttle new era rolled on into their last match before the Ashes with a 56-run one-off Twenty20 defeat of Brendon McCullum’s cavaliers on a crisp, run-filled, valedictory evening at Old Trafford. For England this was once again a Joe Root Day as the team’s best player in all three formats was by turns innovative, orthodox and even a little slapstick in compiling 68 off 46 balls. Around him a supporting cast of all-purpose dashers chipped in to compile a healthy looking 191 that proved to be comfortably out of reach.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jun/23/england-new-zealand-twenty20-live\">England v New Zealand: Twenty20 – live!</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By the end an aggressive display in the field led by some tight, straight fast bowling by Mark Wood and Ben Stokes was enough to suggest a carry-over of the white-ball optimism of recent weeks. As Eoin Morgan said afterwards: “The guys are playing with smiles on their faces, everyone’s enjoying each other’s company, everyone’s playing fearless cricket.” Over to you then, Alastair.</p> \n<p>With the first Ashes Test just three weeks away there had been a tendency to dismiss this match as a quirk of scheduling, a piece of lint on the lapel of an otherwise perfectly spruce Test and one-day summer. But in its own way this was more significant than any of the 50-over stuff that preceded it. England now have just three confirmed Twenty20 internationals before next year’s World Twenty20 in India. The poster for the evening may have carried the strapline ‚“Live music, live action, live cricket” (in that order), but this was still an occasion from which England will have been keen to learn as much as possible.</p> \n<p>Morgan won the toss as the shadows lengthened and chose to bat first on another excellent batting pitch. England’s team was the same XI that had chased down a shortened target in Durham, with Sam Billings, David Willey and Mark Wood making their international Twenty20 debuts and confirming the new synergy between the two white-ball teams.</p> \n<p>New Zealand picked two spinners, and with familiar Brendon McCullum-ish ballsiness gave the debutant Mitchell Santner the ball for a tight first over. Jason Roy got England going, yahooing Mitchell McClenaghan’s second ball into the crowd at straight midwicket with that familiar skip down the wicket, before being run out rather softly for an adrenal 23 off 13 balls.</p> \n<p>Tim Southee was on-driven for six by Root, then ramp-cut – an extraordinary piece of mid-shot adjustment – for a jaw-dropping four to third man as the opening powerplay brought 60 runs. Alex Hales skied Santner to cover to depart for 27 off 22 and Jonny Bairstow saw his off stump pegged back in the same over. But with Root in knockabout mood, placing the ball dreamily and in between reeling out the swats and the scoops, England got to 100 in the 11th over and Root to a lovely, effortless fifty off 36 balls with a whiplash pull off Nathan McCullum. That over went for 23, including an easy flicked six into the shadow of The Point by Billings, who was out shortly afterwards for a crazed but very useful 21 off 10 balls.</p> \n<p>Stokes and Adil Rashid biffed and dinked profitably at the end to leave England with an imposing total that looked better straight away as Willey swung one back to take out Martin Guptill’s leg stump with the third ball of the reply.</p> \n<p>New Zealand were never likely to die wondering, just as nobody hits the ball quite like Brendon McCullum, who for all his strength and fast hands has a beautiful economy of movement about his attacking strokes. Here Steven Finn, Willey and Wood were all hit for six in the opening overs before Wood sent McCullum on his way, producing a fast full ball from wide of the crease that cannoned into the stumps off a thick bottom-edge.</p> \n<p>A a horrible first over from Rashid went for 17 and New Zealand were ahead at the end of the powerplay on 72 for two, with Kane Williamson playing as he has all summer, all frictionless right-handed severity. England needed wickets badly. They got the unexpected bonus of a slightly frazzled New Zealand collapse – described as “amateur hour” by McCullum – as Ross Taylor lofted Rashid to Willey at long off, Colin Munro was bowled slogging at Stokes and Luke Ronchi played a horrible attempted ramp straight up in the air.</p> \n<p>Williamson continued to play beautifully, easing to a controlled, elegant fifty off just 31 balls. But some timely tight bowling by Finn and Wood left New Zealand needing 61 off 31 with seven wickets down, the last of them a sensational one-handed pick-up and direct hit by Willey to run out Williamson. Southee holed out next ball to give Wood his third wicket. And that was pretty much that. Cue the flames, the fireworks and – up next – the Ashes.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435092761514/Joe-Root-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joe Root continued his impressive ODI form in the one-off T20 international to help England to a 56-run win at Old Trafford.
