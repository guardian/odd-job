New Zealand must be bewildered. How often has a team had their opponents 30 for four within the first hour and then scored 523 runs in their first innings – and lost? That was their fate and they must still be scratching their heads and aching.</p> \n<p>The vast majority of the 20,000 spectators, who turned up on the people’s bank holiday Monday may not be heading to Leeds. Most were locals, who had walked in and they had the time of their lives – except perhaps the ones in beige. For this was a memorable, tantalising contest with an outcome way beyond most people’s expectations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/england-new-zealand-first-test-match-report\">Ben Stokes inspires England to win thrilling Test against New Zealand</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>They were snaking all the way up the Wellington Road at 10am in the morning and they left eight and a half hours later beaming as if they had won the lottery. There is still an appetite for the game here; the punters only need a little encouragement – and a fair ticket price (&pound;20 per adult, &pound;10 for seniors, free for juniors) to come out. The cricket from both sides on the first four days had provided that extra incentive. But on the fifth only England excelled.</p> \n<p>Many of the punters left hoarse. There was so much to cheer and the majority saw it as their duty to be England’s 12th man. Lord’s is the most decorous of grounds, where onlookers, draped in weird multicoloured garb, are expected to applaud jolly good cricket, rather than the home side – except perhaps when Australia are playing.</p> \n<p>But at critical moments they embarked on rounds of rhythmical clapping, increasing in intensity as one of England’s fast bowlers ran up to the crease. They were even doing it in the Warner stand and that’s where the members sit.</p> \n<p>Lord’s has seldom been a Colosseum of cricket. It is more of a theatre. Yet the 20,000 were transfixed by every ball and then roared with delight when another New Zealand batsman made his doleful way back to the pavilion.</p> \n<p>Many of the fans may have been here 12 months ago when Sri Lanka held on for a draw on the last evening with nine wickets down, a precursor to England losing that series off the penultimate ball of the next match at Headingley. Given how everything has been going over the last 15 months they might have feared something similar. But there were no frustrations this time around.</p> \n<p>For once everything Alastair Cook touched turned to gold. Just after his dismissal Shane Warne breezed through the pressbox, declaring to no one in particular: “This will be a good game if there’s a hat-trick now”. Obviously Cook was deemed to be batting on too long. The England innings went on for another four overs and 20 runs but it transpired they had plenty of time.</p> \n<p>It was not an act of genius for Cook to toss the new ball to Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad; it was hardly Brearleyesque to invite Ben Stokes to have an early bowl but several other little manoeuvres worked out rather well. Moeen Ali bowled poorly again when the expectation of him to take wickets loomed large, which had been the case in Barbados. He delivered a horrible over to the belligerent Corey Anderson.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/england-lords-roar-alastair-cook-new-zealand\">Lord’s roar is music to Alastair Cook’s ears in England triumph</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So the next time Cook required a spinner he tossed the ball to Joe Root instead. The defiant Anderson was lbw. Then Cook brought back Moeen. The not so defiant Tim Southee was caught and bowled and Moeen’s confidence was partially restored.</p> \n<p>His neatest ploy was his last. After almost 10 overs of resistance from the last pair there was the precise, cunning deployment of Moeen 12 metres inside the boundary at third man. Glory be – next ball Trent Boult found him with unerring accuracy. Whoops of delight all round at the prospect of England heading north 1-0 up in the series.</p> \n<p>However the roars from the stands were loudest when Stokes had the ball in his hand. There were moments in this Test when Stokes made Freddie Flintoff look like John the Baptist. One of them was at the conclusion of his third over. That was when he had just beaten Kane Williamson, who has the broadest bat in New Zealand, with two sublime, snorting deliveries. The next ball was edged to the gully. Then came that in-swinger to Brendon McCullum.</p> \n<p>Stokes was the obvious man of the match. He has been brilliant, turning the game twice with the bat on the first and fourth days and once with the ball on the fifth. Here Stokes was unfettered and dangerous. Just do not expect too much consistency. That can’t be part of the current deal. Be grateful, not greedy.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432591095342/Alastair-Cook--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's captain Alastair Cook savours the moment of victory against New Zealand as the crowd, even in the pavilion behind him, goes wild at Lord's.

As with so many aspects of Liverpool’s mutable, oddly unquantifiable progress in the last two years, it might just be best to double-check the figures on that one. By Sunday night, Liverpool’s manager had recalculated. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/24/liverpool-brendan-rodgers-owners-manager-apologises-fans-stoke-city\">“I’ve always said if the owners want me to go, I go,”</a> he reasoned, pirouetting on his heel with a lithe, finely-balanced sense of sure-footedness that brought to mind something almost entirely unlike Emre Can.</p> \n<p>Rodgers is the kind of manager you can’t help wanting to believe in, even just a little bit. If only because of the memory of Liverpool’s best period in his three years to date, that thrilling surge in the previous season when a run of one defeat from January to April was marked by fast starts and sublime, fluent attacking interchange between three players who have, for different reasons, been largely absent this season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/25/liverpool-brendan-rodgers-fsg-owners-anfield-future-stoke-pressure\">Brendan Rodgers backed by FSG to walk through Liverpool storm</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rodgers has always presented himself as a seductively modern creature, a “process manager” with a fully tooled-up range of coaching neologisms, from state-of-the-art fluent passing football, to his urge to mint new positions, subvert the dominant paradigm, play a false No9 and 3/4 and all the rest of it. Plus, of course, there is that alluringly sonorous Liverpool-shaded persona, in the good times at least, a kind of Shankly-lite mash-up of the magnetic personality, the ringing tones, the grand gestures.</p> \n<p>And then, of course, there’s the Liverpool team. Like Rodgers himself, the side have been a little obscured in recent times, hard to get a decent look at. The bald facts are that three years on, and with &pound;210m spent, Liverpool have won no trophies and enjoyed <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/dec/09/liverpool-basel-champions-league-match-report\">one disappointing Champions League season</a>. And yet in a sense Rodgers has been protected a little through this by the distracting effects of three competing wider narratives.</p> \n<p>The first of these we might call the Su&aacute;rez Distortion. It turns out, with the benefit of hindsight, that not only is Luis Su&aacute;rez a brilliantly decisive footballer, he is also phenomenally good at helping other players shine. Last year it was Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling at Liverpool. This time it’s Neymar and the recalibrated genius of Lionel Messi. By extension he’s a tonic for managers, too: with the world’s most selflessly, relentlessly intelligent centre-forward in his team Luis Enrique has also been transformed into a revered attacking technician.</p> \n<p>The net result is that after three years in which Liverpool have finished seventh, second and sixth it is tempting to conclude that what happened in that middle year is not that Liverpool managed to come second; but that with the outstanding Premier League player of the last six years in their team they failed to come first.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8eae3ec0308bd4bbf60f4b3115a81f0321fc55d1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432592207310/092dc9cd-7968-4dd4-ae74-8d0f84a2dcc0-460x293.jpeg\" alt=\"Luis Su&aacute;rez was (so brilliant for Liverpool maybe we should be asking why Brendan Rodgers failed to win the title with him in the side last year,\" width=\"460\" height=\"293\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Luis Su&aacute;arez was (so brilliant for Liverpool maybe we should be asking why Brendan Rodgers failed to win the title with him in the side last year.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Ellis/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was always likely Liverpool would miss the 55-goal contribution of Su&aacute;rez and Sturridge this time round. But even before the invertebrate defeat at Stoke there was a more profound, systemic feel to the team’s congealment.</p> \n<p>Liverpool have competed in five competitions this season. The manner of their exit from the running in each has been genuinely disappointing. The Champions League campaign brought just one win, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/sep/16/liverpool-ludogorets-champions-league\">at home to Ludogorets in the opening game</a>. In both domestic cup competitions the big games – semi-finals or against the game’s better managers – continued to elude Rodgers.</p> \n<p>The Premier League season disintegrated after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/22/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">the home defeat by Manchester United</a> in March, the first of six losses in 11 games to cap a season that saw Liverpool go from 84 points last season to 62 this.</p> \n<p>If Rodgers has been a little lucky it is in the fact the mechanics behind this falling away have been drowned out to a degree by noises off the pitch. First there has been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/21/raheem-sterling-liverpool-agent-contract-900000\">the ongoing furore of Raheem Sterling’s wanderlust</a>. This has undoubtedly been <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/21/aidy-ward-raheem-sterling-liverpool-agent\">appallingly handled by his agent</a>. But it has also been allowed to encroach as far as possible, to play out as disruptively as any saga anywhere in recent memory.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/25/divock-origi-liverpool-lille-ligue-1-worst-team-of-season\">Liverpool striker Divock Origi named in Ligue 1 worst team of the season</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This is not a first. Star players will always want to leave. Young players often have their heads turned. Rodgers has been unlucky with the way this one has played itself out. But how would Shankly, or Sir Alex Ferguson or Jos&eacute; Mourinho have handled it? Or even, in Rodgers’ favour, a manager with a little more obvious on-site support from his board and owners?</p> \n<p>Similarly Steven Gerrard’s protracted farewell tour has overhung a large portion of the season. Just as man inevitably hands on misery to man, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/16/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report\">Gerrard’s sentimental departure</a> has been transformed into exactly the same distracting shadow of the past that has shadowed his own career. Bring me lucky generals, Napoleon said. Rodgers has been the opposite, forced to fight simultaneously on three fronts, only one of them strictly footballing. And yet for all that a great part of managing has always been managing problems, coping with bad luck, funnelling the right kind of energy your own way.</p> \n<p>The gripes against Rodgers’ micro-management are well rehearsed. A tendency to lose the big points. A habit of fiddling tactically, a fixed-gear zaniness that is at times more a sign of stubbornness than flexibility. But really what might just do for him now, a mark of underachievement that can’t be obscured by any wider narrative, are his dealings in the transfer market.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b04244f43126a68e27cb8305a7594f455404ead3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432592384080/a277c6be-7721-4eca-8961-cc66943f1e89-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mario Balotelli is far from being Brendan Rodgers' only expensive mistake in the transfer market.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mario Balotelli is far from being Brendan Rodgers’ only expensive mistake in the transfer market.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martin Rickett/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The manager must take a degree of responsibility both for the signings and subsequent progress of Fabio Borini (&pound;10.5m), Joe Allen (&pound;15m), Adam Lallana (&pound;25m), Lazar Markovic (&pound;20m) Dejan Lovren (&pound;20m), Mamadou Sakho (&pound;18m), Mario Balotelli (&pound;16m), Iago Aspas (&pound;7.2m) and Rickie Lambert (&pound;4m). Not to mention various expensive add-ons and loanees whose merits have so far remained obscure. For all the good business that may have gone the other way, it is a vast expense in a short time. Juventus, by comparison, have spent no more on a single player in the last few years than the &pound;14.5m they gave Real Madrid for &Aacute;lvaro Morata.</p> \n<p>There is simply a sense of wastage there. Liverpool are the ninth richest club in the world, richer than Juventus, Borussia Dortmund, Milan and Atl&eacute;tico Madrid. But can they really afford to trust the same manager with another three seasons’ worth of transfer budget?

It’s strange for a British player. Maybe he’s the best guy on clay, I don’t know, because he’s playing with spin on the forehand. It’s not typical for a British player. For example, Murray is playing flat from both sides. It looks like he likes to play on clay.”</p> \n<p>Murray would seem to have found his compass here since the bizarre evening when the capital’s underground system bamboozled him, and his strong start – subduing then taming the wild-swinging Argentinian Facundo Arg&uuml;ello in an hour and 45 minutes – was the sort of performance to lift the hopes of his compatriots left in the tournament, Edmund and Heather Watson.</p> \n<p>Murray even went out after his own match to support Edmund in the final set of his 2-6, 6-4, 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 victory that lasted just under three hours.</p> \n<p>“He’s obviously just played his match, and he’s gone through all his recovery stuff and he doesn’t have to come out and watch me, but he has,” Edmund said later. “It just shows that he really cares. I’m very fortunate someone like that is, you know, keen to help me.”</p> \n<p>Two others fell – Johanna Konta to the Czech Denisa Allertova after throwing away the first set in a marathon tie-break, and the newly qualified former Slovenian Aljaz Bedene after a high-class fight with the talented young Austrian Dominic Thiem over three hours and 22 minutes, one of the longest matches of the day.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/french-open-2015-heather-watson-mathilde-johansson-sloane-stephens\">French Open 2015: Heather Watson win sets up Sloane Stephens showdown</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Murray, meanwhile, went some way to confirming with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-1 win, admittedly against a player with nothing to lose on his major debut on a main court, that the tennis which brought him 10 wins on the spin and two titles leading up to Roland Garros represents strong evidence of a maturing clay game.</p> \n<p>It was a view the loser happily endorsed. “I played very well the first two sets but, in the third set, Murray behaved like a champion,” Arg&uuml;ello said. “He has big chances to go on and win the tournament. I think any of the big players can win it but I think he has improved a lot on clay.”</p> \n<p>But Murray cautioned against brief success fuelling unreasonable expectations for British tennis.</p> \n<p>“The last few years there have been lots of doubles guys around, which is nice,” he said. “And the more players in the singles, the better. Winning a couple of rounds at a French Open for us is good. But I don’t think France or Spain or the Argentinians would look at it and be very impressed. A lot of the other nations have multiple players going deep into the grand slams. And ultimately that’s where you want to try to get to.</p> \n<p>“Tennis in the UK is obviously a big sport, there’s a lot of money invested in it, so you want to try to get as much depth as possible. I saw a little bit of Bedene and Thiem’s match before I went on. Seemed like it was a pretty good match. It’s obviously good that Heather has won. I saw Jo lost a tough first set.”</p> \n<p>Edmund, whose gentle demeanour disguises a strong mind, ignored the barrage of distractions that accompanied his return from a bathroom break to contest the fifth set and broke at the first time of asking, then held his nerve in the fading light against a backdrop of loud French interruptions at key moments.</p> \n<p>Cramping up in his left leg, he reined in his serve and was relieved to see Robert’s final forehand drift long. It was one of the toughest and most convincing wins of his career. On Wednesday he has a much tougher test in the second round, against the rising Australian Nick Kyrgios, who looked outstanding in defeating Denis Istomin 6-3, 6-4, 6-3.</p> \n<p>As for Murray, he will know by early afternoon if he is to play the Canadian Vasek Pospisil or Portugal’s erratic but talented Jo&atilde;o Sousa, who meet in the first match on Court No3 on Tuesday.</p> \n<p>“I was nervous today, always the first rounds of majors are tough, and it was a bit windy,” Murray said after a match that hit more than a few highs and lows in difficult conditions before he prevailed, as expected.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432587663275/Andy-Murray-cheers-on-Kyl-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andy Murray cheers on his compatriot Kyle Edmund during his win against Stéphane Robert in the 2015 French Open.

Norwich City had dismantled the most parsimonious defence in the Championship inside the opening quarter of an hour and at the final whistle it was the yellow end, rather than Middlesbrough’s banks of red, where the euphoria could be found.</p> \n<p>At the other side of the stadium, they did at least buck the modern trend of deserting en masse as soon as it became apparent there was no way back for their team. Yet the damage inflicted on Middlesbrough during those three minutes when the goals were scored was always likely to be grievous. The last time they won from 2-0 down was back in 2006 when Steve McClaren was manager, Mark Viduka partnered Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink in attack and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2006/apr/28/match.sport\">the opposition was Steaua Bucharest in a Uefa Cup semi-final</a>. The modern-day team do not have a Viduka or Hasselbaink and, though they did rally briefly in the second half, there were only fleeting moments when they seriously threatened. Ultimately, there could be no dispute that promotion had gone to the more rounded team.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/25/norwich-middlesbrough-alex-neil-canny-approach\">Norwich too good for Middlesbrough thanks to Alex Neil’s canny approach | Paul Doyle</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Norwich, in the process, have been richly rewarded for having <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jan/09/norwich-city-alex-neil-new-manager\">the nerve and foresight to appoint Alex Neil from Hamilton Academical</a> when they needed a new manager in January. Neil comes from Bellshill, the same north Lanarkshire town where Sir Matt Busby grew up, and seems intent on reminding us about Scotland’s prolific production line of managers after a season in which <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/feb/11/aston-villa-paul-lambert-sacked-manager\">Paul Lambert’s sacking at Aston Villa</a> had left England’s top division without one from north of the border. At 33, Neil will be one of the youngest managers of the Premier League era and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/25/norwich-middlesbrough-alex-neil-canny-approach\">there is plenty to admire</a> judging by the way this team have improved under him.</p> \n<p>The trophy had barely been lifted before the first press release went out from the bookmakers announcing Norwich as odds-on to go down next season. It is almost standard practice these days because of the gulf between the two divisions but Neil has given the club a new sense of momentum and his squad is not short of players with experience of coping at the highest level. What cannot be disputed is the financial rewards are enormous, at around &pound;130m. And what about the prestige? “People keep telling me I was at Arbroath in front of 700 fans at the start of the season,” Neil said.</p> \n<p>Middlesbrough will wonder whether it might have been different if the volley that Jelle Vossen slashed towards John Ruddy’s net after nine minutes had been a couple inches lower rather than clanging off the crossbar. They should not dwell on that moment too long, however.</p> \n<p>Bradley Johnson had done the same for Norwich barely 30 seconds earlier and the bottom line is that Aitor Karanka’s side chose a bad day to lose their qualities of defensive structure and organisation. It was difficult at times to remember this was a team that had accumulated 22 clean sheets and beaten Norwich twice this season, scoring five times and not conceding once. They paid a heavy price for being so error-prone and the game was a personal ordeal in particular for Daniel Ayala, a former Norwich player, bearing in mind it was his dithering on the ball that began the sequence of mistakes that led to the first goal.</p> \n<p>Ayala’s mix-up with Dean Whitehead left Cameron Jerome advancing from the flank, probably expecting at least one opponent would come across to block off the shot. It never happened. The next defender, Ben Gibson, hung back, mistakenly thinking Jerome would look for a team-mate, and the goalkeeper, Dimitrios Konstantopoulos, also seemed to be caught in two minds. Jerome weighed up his options, lined up the angles and turned his shot inside the near post.</p> \n<p>As the Norwich players went to congratulate Jerome, Ayala’s team-mates gathered around the Spaniard to try to lift the defender’s spirits. Yet it was not just Ayala who will leave with regrets. Patrick Bamford had a frustrating time in his final match on loan from Chelsea. Vossen was booked for diving before being substituted and maybe Karanka made a mistake as well by arranging for the coach to arrive at the stadium only 50 minutes before the kick-off.</p> \n<p>His worry, he explained, was that the players might be consumed by nerves if they spent too long in the dressing room. As it turned out, they could hardly have got off to a worse start.</p> \n<p>Neil’s preparations had included a tour of Wembley last week so his players were used to the surroundings. They settled quickly and, even ignoring the goals, the opening quarter of an hour could be neatly encapsulated by the moment Wes Hoolahan, such a clever little footballer, slipped the ball through the legs of Grant Leadbitter.</p> \n<p>The opening goal came out of nowhere and, buoyed, it was a lovely sequence of crisp passes that culminated in Steven Whittaker playing in Nathan Redmond to double the lead. Redmond’s first touch moved him away from Gibson and created the angle for him to take aim. The second was fired into the bottom corner and Neil’s water bottle was launched into the air in celebration.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432571841877/2b295490-92e9-4ffb-ba0e-0c163d335eb0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Norwich City's Scottish defender Russell Martin hoists the trophy after the club's 2-0 win over Boro at Wembley","cleanCredit":"Photograph: BEN STANSALL/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-25T16:07:34Z","lastModified":"2015-05-25T23:00:48Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":219,"contributors":[{"name":"Daniel Taylor","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/7/1399489693450/Daniel-Taylor-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/danieltaylor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Championship","Norwich City","Middlesbrough","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/championship","webTitle":"Championship"},{"id":"football/norwichcity","webTitle":"Norwich City"},{"id":"football/middlesbrough","webTitle":"Middlesbrough"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Daniel Taylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/danieltaylor"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"footballContent":{"id":"3830366","status":"FT","phase":"after","kickOff":"2015-05-25T14:00:00Z","competitionDisplayName":"Championship Play-Offs Final","homeTeam":{"id":"30","name":"Middlesboro","shortCode":"MID","crestUri":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/sport/football/crests/30.png?width=#{width}","score":0,"followUp":{"type":"list","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/middlesbrough"},"topic":{"displayName":"Middlesboro","topic":{"type":"football-team","name":"30"}}},"awayTeam":{"id":"14","name":"Norwich","shortCode":"NOR","crestUri":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/sport/football/crests/14.png?width=#{width}","score":2,"scorers":[{"player":"Jerome","timeInMinutes":12},{"player":"Redmond","timeInMinutes":15}],"followUp":{"type":"list","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/norwichcity"},"topic":{"displayName":"Norwich","topic":{"type":"football-team","name":"14"}}},"matchInfoUri":"http://football.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/match-info/3830366","venue":"Wembley Stadium"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/25/middlesbrough-norwich-championship-play-off-final-match-report","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497m9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/may/25/middlesbrough-norwich-championship-play-off-final-match-report","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/25/middlesbrough-norwich-championship-play-off-final-match-report"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432571841877/2b295490-92e9-4ffb-ba0e-0c163d335eb0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Norwich City’s Scottish defender Russell Martin hoists the trophy after the club’s 2-0 win over Boro at Wembley.

I am really upset because it was not necessary. It was the wrong decision to bring him in. It was very obvious. There was no risk to keep him out.”</p> \n<p>Lauda, a three-times world champion, added: “It was heartbreaking for Lewis, for me and everybody in the team. Lewis did say he was not happy with the tyres but then we overreacted by bringing him in. It was completely unnecessary, a huge mistake because this is Monaco where you cannot pass. I apologised to him and his team because we ended up destroying his race.”</p> \n<p>Hamilton was brought in following the introduction of the safety car after Max Verstappen’s crash on the 64th lap. A mistake in Mercedes’ data led the team to miscalculate the gap between Hamilton and Rosberg and Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel. Anything can happen in a pit-stop, so common sense said Hamilton should have been left out on the track.</p> \n<p>Wolff said: “The debrief will happen with the engineers first. The system showing us the clear possibility of a clear stop. And the system was wrong by a couple of seconds. Normally you go for those kind of stops. Lewis’s comments about the tyres added to the picture. We pitted. In hindsight, if you look at it from a common-sense standpoint, obviously there is a very different logic.”</p> \n<p>Rosberg, who on Sunday was described by F1’s chief executive Bernie Ecclestone as being <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/24/bernie-ecclestone-nico-rosberg-f1\" title=\"\">“not good for business because he does not ‘sell’ the sport like Hamilton”</a>, knows he won by default. “I have mixed feelings,” the German said in a video on his Twitter feed. “I am very happy because a win is a win and I’ve learned to take the way it comes in sport. It was massively lucky, massively lucky. I’ve probably never been that lucky before.</p> \n<p>“At the same time, though, I have a lot of empathy for Lewis and all his side of the garage. They did a great job this weekend and deserved the win but sport is really awful sometimes. It hit him this time but he’ll bounce back in Montreal I am sure.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432569056312/Lewis-Hamilton-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lewis Hamilton could not hide his fury on the podium at the Monaco GP and Nico Rosberg admitted he was 'massively lucky' to win the race Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPA","credit":"Yoan Valat/EPA","altText":"Lewis Hamilton","cleanCaption":"Lewis Hamilton could not hide his fury on the podium at the Monaco GP and Nico Rosberg admitted he was 'massively lucky' to win the race Photograph: Yoan Valat/EPA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-25T21:00:04Z","lastModified":"2015-05-25T23:01:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Paul Weaver","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/23/1400861356823/Paul-Weaver-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/paulweaver"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Lewis Hamilton","Mercedes GP","Nico Rosberg","Formula One 2015","Formula One","Motor sport","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/lewis-hamilton","webTitle":"Lewis Hamilton"},{"id":"sport/mercedes-gp","webTitle":"Mercedes GP"},{"id":"sport/nico-rosberg","webTitle":"Nico Rosberg"},{"id":"sport/formula-one-2015","webTitle":"Formula One 2015"},{"id":"sport/formulaone","webTitle":"Formula One"},{"id":"sport/motorsports","webTitle":"Motor sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paul Weaver","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/paulweaver"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/25/mercedes-blunder-lewis-hamilton-monaco-niki-lauda","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497mb","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/may/25/mercedes-blunder-lewis-hamilton-monaco-niki-lauda","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/25/mercedes-blunder-lewis-hamilton-monaco-niki-lauda"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432569056312/Lewis-Hamilton-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Lewis Hamilton could not hide his fury on the podium at the Monaco GP and Nico Rosberg admitted he was ‘massively lucky’ to win the race.
