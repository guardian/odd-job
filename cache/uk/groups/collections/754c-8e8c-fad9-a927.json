Nevertheless, while the AKB v WOB (Ars&egrave;ne Knows Best v Wenger Out Brigade) debate rages ad infinitum, most footie fans would be over the moon with a top three finish, never mind a Wembley encore.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>Alexis S&aacute;nchez. Aside from his obvious quality, in these mercenary times a new arrival who puts everything on the line, in every single minute of every single match will inevitably be an instant hit. Also worth a mention: Franny Coquelin, who couldn’t get a game on loan at Charlton in December, has turned into our Makelele-like midfield linchpin, while Laurent Koscielny deserves far more credit. <strong>The flops </strong>Yaya Sa-no-goal, Szczesny for failing to grasp the mantle instead of a pack of Marlboro, and the entire team’s failure to step up at crucial times.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>The rise of Le Coq has resulted in a change in priorities. After clamouring for so long for an invisible midfield behemoth &agrave; la Pogba, suddenly we’re coveting all our competitors’ top-shelf keepers, while there is a dearth of centre-forward options.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Sunderland’s midweek travellers were the best. Newcastle didn’t impress.</p> \n<p><strong>Ideal montage music for Arsenal’s season highlights </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYHa863sHW0\">BB King – Same Old Story (Same Old Song)</a></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/23/premier-league-fans-verdict-manchester-united-west-ham\">Premier League fans’ verdicts part 2: Manchester United to West Ham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Aston Villa – Jonathan Pritchard</h2> \n<p><strong>9/10 </strong>That’s a post-February rating, of course. Thankfully those pre-Sherwood days have quickly become a distant memory. Paul Lambert seemed to lose his confidence and with it the dressing room: we bear him few grudges, the biggest niggle being it took the owner so long to take action. Sherwood came with plenty to prove: he’d been rejected by others and had a London swagger that rarely sits well with the average Brummie. How wrong we were. He’s instilled the $64,000 ingredient into the team – confidence – and, pleasingly, he’s been self-critical when he’s got it wrong. We’ve enjoyed one truly sensational day at Wembley, and whatever happens next Saturday, I’ll be looking forward to August. I’ve also bought a gilet and some pointy shoes.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>Alan Hutton was easily man of the Lambert season. Since then, Delph, Cleverley and Benteke, among others, have been giants. Bacuna has also excelled of late. Grealish could go either way. <strong>The flops </strong>Aly Cissokho started well but faded.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Cleverley, a new deal for Benteke and a game-bossing centre-half.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Blackpool were best; West Brom worst.</p> \n<p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToqNa0rqUtY\">Conchita Wurst – Rise like a Phoenix</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d49e664c50235b8371730e7db29b2c57fc1ab07c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432404945593/a22d50b9-8cba-475f-92fb-354fb7cf15db-336x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Team of the season\" width=\"336\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The fans’ 2014-15 Premier League team of the season - based on performances against their teams</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Burnley – Tony Scholes – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clarets_mad\">@Clarets_Mad</a></h2> \n<p><strong>6/10 </strong>Expectations were realistic – we were hoping to stay out of the bottom three but didn’t quite manage it. There were times when it looked possible but we were never able to string together a run of good results. I think the manager and players performed well, though, and we weren’t too far short in the end. Perhaps the worst aspect was not getting our player recruitment right in either window.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>We’re not a team of stars, but Danny Ings scored ten goals and Ashley Barnes had an outstanding spell up front. Defensively we were more than OK, with goalkeeper Tom Heaton and central defenders Michael Duff and Jason Shackell playing consistently well. <strong>The flops </strong>Some of the new signings didn’t have an impact. Matty Taylor missed much of the season with injuries, Steven Reid was often out, and neither of the two new strikers – Lukas Jutkiewicz and Marvin Sordell – scored a league goal.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>With Ings set to leave, we’ll need a clever forward – but I’d also like to see a creative midfielder and an injection of pace.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Swansea, QPR and Newcastle were worst – the best were those who filled our away end, and several managed that.</p> \n<p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPC_evpbwDM\">Calvin Harris – We’ll be Coming Back</a>.</p> \n<h2>Chelsea – Trizia Fiorellino – <a href=\"http://www.chelseasupportersgroup.net/\">ChelseaSupportersGroup.net</a></h2> \n<p><strong>9.5/10 </strong>The season was nigh-on perfect. We were expected to win the title – correction, Jos&eacute; was expected to win the title – and he did it with bells on. Also he did it his way, with no concessions to public opinion. Some may argue we were expected to go further in the Champions League but I don’t think we had the firepower for that. The Carling Cup was a bonus.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>The brightest star of all was Eden Hazard, quite rightly named Footballer of the Year. His artistry ensured that we were never boring, despite what the media would have you believe. What makes Hazard even more invaluable is the way he dealt with being individually targeted for special physical attention by many opponents. But just as important was John Terry – still defying time, still putting his head where most defenders fear putting their boot. And a special mention to F&agrave;bregas – as well as having a pretty good season, he delivered a red card to remember. <strong>The flops </strong>None, really – maybe Cuadrado, but let’s see where we are after pre-season.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>With Cech seemingly on his way we need a back-up. We also need another quality striker and, with a heavy heart, we must start the search for a long-term replacement for Terry.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Bradford were best – amazing scenes when they knocked us out of the cup. The worst – surprisingly – were Palace.</p> \n<p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong>One for Jos&eacute; here: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CduA0TULnow\">Britney Spears – Oops I Did It Again.</a></p> \n<h2>Crystal Palace – Chris Waters – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/clapham_grand\">@Clapham_Grand</a></h2> \n<p><strong>9/10 </strong>To be close to equalling or bettering last year’s points tally and position is verging on the miraculous given the poor start we had under Neil Warnock. The club has been transformed under Alan Pardew, and there’s now real optimism that he can take Palace on to the next level. The performance at Anfield last weekend was typical of our best moments: resolute, solid and full of flair on the break.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>Mile Jedinak continued where he left off last season until a prolonged absence due to the Asia Cup and a flailing elbow saw him fall out of favour. James McArthur and Scott Dann have impressed, but the transformation of Jason Puncheon into a midfield libero this year has been a revelation. Yannick Bolasie has drawn plenty of headlines, too, and was applauded off by the home fans when he was subbed at Anfield. If he can find a bit more consistency, he’ll be formidable. <strong>The flops </strong>I still have no idea why we loaned in Yaya Sanogo from Arsenal. He’s contributed little, verging on nothing.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>To push into the top ten – who’d have thought that’d be the aim a few years ago? – we need a top quality centre back and a striker who can notch 15 goals a season. And a new goalkeeper may also be on the cards.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>QPR were worst, Southampton best.</p> \n<p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiG2VeNkLuE\">Depeche Mode – I Just Can’t Get Enough</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0e2943f5b0818133b6726da27e8b15c91252377e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432405519917/479dac1d-4df6-43a8-ad60-8a681d135d94-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Romelu Lukaku: 20 goals\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Romelu Lukaku: 20 goals</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Everton – Steve Jones – <a href=\"http://bluekipper.com/\">BlueKipper.com</a></h2> \n<p><strong>5/10 </strong>After finishing in a European spot last season, it’s disappointing to be stuck in tenth this time round. I really expected us to be battling for qualification again. It wasn’t all underwhelming: to finish top of the group in Europa League and go to Wolfsburg and Young Boys and win was outstanding – but to flop out of the FA Cup to West Ham and the Capital One Cup to Swansea, both at the third-round stage, was particularly poor.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>I honestly don’t think we had any outstanding individuals this season. Jagielka and McCarthy played well for most of the campaign, though, and Lukaku deserves praise for scoring 20 goals. <strong>The flops </strong>Atsu, Kon&eacute; and McGeady didn’t live up to expectations, but they were out injured for long periods. Distin and Alcaraz were both poor.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>I hope we sign a top-class midfield playmaker, as Pienaar and Osman are getting old and injured. We need someone classy to put that final pass through – and another striker to get on the end of those through-balls would be very welcome, too</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Palace were the loudest visitors we had at Goodison. The worst were Manchester United, for breaking the minute’s silence for Sir Philip Carter.</p> \n<p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q1Awug6zeMY\">The Seekers – We Shall Not be Moved</a>.</p> \n<h2>Hull –Rick Skelton – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hullcitylive\">@HullCityLive</a></h2> \n<p><strong>4/10 </strong>It’s been a major let-down on the pitch given the investment in the squad last summer, while the ongoing “Hull Tigers” nonsense continued to cause division off it. The disappointment started early with the needless exit from the Europa League and, though there have been moments of quality, consistent inconsistency has ruled. Steve Bruce bought players who didn’t meet the standards of professionalism he’d established in the squad and has failed to get the best out of players who are capable of much, much more. We’ve also been riddled with injuries – too many to just be pure luck.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>Nikica Jelavic makes a big difference. Whenever he’s injured, which is too often, we’re unrecognisable. Michael Dawson improved after a tough start and, in a season where big names have let us down, Paul McShane, Stephen Quinn and David Meyler never have. <strong>The flops </strong>&pound;10m Abel Hern&aacute;ndez and Tom Huddlestone, who has been garbage for 18 months.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>We need quality in midfield and we’re crying out for pace on the break.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Lokeren fans were incredible in the Europa League, while Man City were the very definition of “You only sing when you’re winning”.</p> \n<p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjPhzgxe3L0\">The Smiths – Heaven Knows I’m Miserable Now</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a5c9c8997201709eb12cd59a7848a8dcbcda1385\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432405143284/490423be-d177-4d6f-a354-0ffcce1f33b1-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Pearson: antics.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nigel Pearson: antics.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Leicester – Chris Whiting – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisrwhiting\">@ChrisRWhiting</a></h2> \n<p><strong>7/10 </strong>Well, it’s just about worked itself out in a roundabout way. I was dreading writing this review and having to apologise for my cocky pre-season predictions, but as it is I’m pretty satisfied. We’ve gone from world beaters to whipping boys to world beaters again. And most fans in Leicester took Nigel Pearson’s antics in good humour.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>It’s hard to look past “the magic man” Esteban Cambiasso: it’s been a privilege to see such a talented, composed and cultured footballer gracing Filbert Way’s famous turf. Jamie Vardy had a great second half to the season and Robert Huth transformed our defence. <strong>The flops </strong>It’s been sad to see Danny Drinkwater fail to flourish in the Premier League. Cult hero Anthony Knockaert has seemingly dropped off the face of the earth this season, Andrej Kramaric has failed to make a real impact, and Paul Konchesky’s best days are far behind him.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Huth is a must, as is securing Cambiasso and signing a new left-back.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Stoke’s were very noisy; Newcastle’s struggled.</p> \n<p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9-Lwpgfd1E\">Rudimental – Not Giving In</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/23/david-de-gea-manchester-united-real-madrid-louis-van-gaal-premier-league\">Manchester United can replace David de Gea but goals are most striking need | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Liverpool - Steph Jones </h2> \n<p><strong>5/10 </strong>It was pretty grim. We had a good afternoon back in September, a brief flurry of optimism somewhere around the start of the year and a fair few lows. But mainly we had mediocrity. Expectations that were running rampant this time last year all but disappeared by Bonfire Night. We ground out a few results to make two semi-finals but couldn’t make the final step in either. The manager spent plenty of time talking up the team and his part in the winning streak and players’ development. There was a lot of hot air blowing around a lot of the time.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>Philippe Coutinho showed flashes of brilliance and guile. Emre Can looks like he could be good for us long term. But mainly the Spirit of Shankly and fans groups – from our club and others – were the stars with their ongoing campaign to reclaim the game and reduce ticket prices. <strong>The flops </strong>Those behind the scenes and the owners who continue to show no leadership, no knowledge of how to run a club and zero regard for the supporters, but have plenty of time to hook up with Dunkin’ Donuts.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Some ready-made players and leaders. James Milner’s been rumoured – I’d welcome him for starters. And a goalscorer, too.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Crystal Palace fans were pretty good: they stayed behind to acknowledge Gerrrard in his last game, and they’ve been at the forefront of the cheaper tickets campaign. The worst? The regulars with their asinine chants.</p> \n<p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRen3jDqViI\">The Beatles – Yesterday</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"818ced1ead5ce72847140cec8138e0501e823aba\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432405357021/39194f9f-1ffb-4c5a-a61e-b30435aa8645-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Sergio Ag&uuml;ero: under-appreciated.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sergio Ag&uuml;ero: under-appreciated.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Manchester City – Lloyd Scragg – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lloyd_scragg\">@lloyd_scragg</a></h2> \n<p><strong>6/10 </strong>It’s been a frustrating season, characterised by underperformance and, ultimately, underachievement. Early exits from both domestic cups set the tone, but most disappointing of all was our total failure to put Chelsea under any pressure, which was criminal having worked so hard to overturn an eight-point deficit in the winter. Pellegrini’s tactical naivety was brutally exposed against Barcelona, and whether he’ll still be at club at the end of the summer remains to be seen. It’s not all doom and gloom, though: our form since the derby shows that, with a few new signings, we can be a force again next season.</p> \n<p><strong>The stars </strong>Sergio Ag&uuml;ero has been brilliant, and again under-appreciated by many. We can’t continue to merely accept his consistent excellence as commonplace: he’s a player to be celebrated, and one of the finest ever to grace the Premier League. Another deserving of greater acclaim is Joe Hart, who has emerged from a difficult period as a much better keeper. He’s been superb for 18 months now. <strong>The flops </strong>Fernando’s been a huge disappointment, Vincent Kompany’s poor form has continued and the jury remains out on Mangala.</p> \n<p><strong>Summer targets </strong>An overhaul. Kevin De Bruyne, Raheem Sterling and Paul Pogba wouldn’t be bad.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Sheffield Wednesday were best; QPR worst. They brought barely 500.

way to prepare for a Test series. Unfortunately England do not have that luxury. But New Zealand, who after three days hold most of the cards in this Test, do.</p> \n<p>The tourists are in the ascendancy mostly due to the expertise of those Sunrisers of Hyderabad Kane Williamson and Trent Boult, with a bit of help from the Rajasthan Royal Tim Southee. Williamson completed a polished century on Saturday, albeit one where he decelerated as if modifying his game to Test cricket along the way; meanwhile Boult, who was outstanding with the ball in England’s first innings, started the rot in their second alongside Southee.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/23/alastair-cook-ian-bell-england-new-zealand-lights\">Mark Wood in awe as Alastair Cook and Ian Bell keep England lights on</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So, at the end of another chastening day, England were 74 for two at the close, still 60 in arrears, and hoping that their senior citizens, Alastair Cook and Ian Bell, can counter the threat of Boult and Southee again in the morning. That was beyond England’s two young Yorkshiremen on Saturday night. Boult remained unconcerned that Adam Lyth had cracked three boundaries in his first seven balls. He knew batting was not really that straightforward. Next came a perfectly pitched away-swinger and Lyth edged to Southee at second slip.</p> \n<p>Gary Ballance was no more reassuring. He bats remarkably deep in the crease at the start of his innings, a system that has worked well for him in the past. But, if he is out of kilter, he looks as vulnerable as Bambi on ice. Here a fine delivery from Southee brushed his off-stump. At the time Ballance’s front foot was still way behind the popping crease. If a little further forward and hit on the pad he might have avoided being lbw. Before this match Ballance averaged 62 in Test cricket, so it is hard to argue with his method. But he has never suggested permanence in this match.</p> \n<p>From 25 for two Cook and Bell, who was in one of his skittish moods (not the worst way out of a trough), were prepared to counterattack but against Boult in particular batting never looked straightforward. The left-armer moved the ball consistently.</p> \n<p>It had been an exacting time for England in the field as well. On Friday their frustration stemmed from the fact that the ball seldom deigned to deviate. Hence the Kiwi upper order purred along to 303 for two.</p> \n<p>On Saturday, just as annoyingly, the ball did jag around under constant cloud cover, yet it took a long time to terminate the innings. Another slip catch went begging – with Bell the culprit again – and there were two hairline reviews, which the batsmen survived.</p> \n<p>There was also much more skilful batsmanship from a side brimful of self-belief. Alongside Williamson, Brendon McCullum flickered and BJ Watling, despite his leg injury, scuttled in the jaunty style of keepers around the world. Extras bolstered the score obligingly with 67. England have only conceded more, 74, in Port of Spain in 2009. As a consequence they are going to have to play very well over the next two days to sustain any hopes of winning this mini-series.</p> \n<p>Williamson, 92 not out overnight, glided to his century within the first two overs. After picking off runs in Moeen Ali’s opening over he dabbed delicately down to third man against Jimmy Anderson before a very modest celebration of his 10th Test century. For him his work was only just beginning. Williamson has the wonderful capacity to bat in a cocoon of apparent serenity, oblivious to distractions from the other 12 players out there. However, with conditions much more demanding, Williamson proceeded more slowly after reaching three figures.</p> \n<p>Ross Taylor left 50 minutes into the session. He had batted dutifully, but against Stuart Broad, who delivered a testing spell with the second new ball, he was superbly caught down the leg side. Jos Buttler took off, stuck out his left-hand and there the ball resided.</p> \n<p>McCullum entered; bars emptied. He punched his first ball through the covers for four. Then there was a period of relative reconnaissance before he started skipping around the crease. Boundaries then sped from various parts of his bat. One leg-side flick off Ben Stokes most definitely came out of the middle because it flew into the grandstand. Stokes could only snarl, McCullum may have raised an eyebrow.</p> \n<p>McCullum and Williamson provided quite a contrast, one flashing, the other dead-batting. At this point a perusal of England’s slip cordon was instructive and mildly alarming.</p> \n<p>They were standing in the same place for both batsmen. Yet it was obvious than an edge from their respective bats would have different consequences. The chances were that the ball would fly from McCullum’s edge but dribble from Williamson’s.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/23/new-zealand-brendon-mccullum-twists-knife-england-lords\">New Zealand’s Brendon McCullum twists the knife against England | Mike Selvey</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>McCullum’s last edge carried all the way to the third-man boundary where an alert Joe Root held a fine catch. This was probably not how Mark Wood dreamt his first Test wicket would come but it would do nicely. Thereafter, Wood was on song, prompting Cook to give him a 12-over spell interrupted by lunch and an hour of rain. Wood impressed with his zip and zest. In the afternoon he dismissed Corey Anderson after another exceptional leg-side catch by Buttler, who is currently happier when 18 yards behind the stumps. Later he dismissed his fellow debutant Matt Henry.</p> \n<p>Williamson surprisingly fell to Moeen, an old-fashioned batsman out in an old‑fashioned way, caught at slip nurdling an off-break. Two balls later Moeen took a 21st-century wicket: Mark Craig lurched forward defensively and was lbw on the front foot. Moeen bowled better than in Barbados, partly because the pitch was not offering him as much help. This situation was far more familiar to him.</p> \n<p>Watling wagged with the tail, snatching runs through the vacant third man region, surviving a catch to gully, which was ruled unclean, and being hit on the head by a Wood bouncer.</p> \n<p>Having struck an unbeaten 61 he withdrew to the dressing room for good with Tom Latham keeping wicket again. Watling would be content not to have to participate in this game again.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432410812482/d7783055-267b-4357-966a-f0e1281c38d0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Nigel French/PA","altText":"Alastair Cook steadied the England ship in partnership with Ian Bell after New Zealand had threatened to blow England away.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Nigel French/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-23T19:00:01Z","lastModified":"2015-05-23T23:18:14Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":285,"contributors":[{"name":"Vic Marks","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vicmarks"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["England cricket team","New Zealand cricket team","Cricket","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/england-cricket-team","webTitle":"England cricket team"},{"id":"sport/new-zealand-cricket-team","webTitle":"New Zealand cricket team"},{"id":"sport/cricket","webTitle":"Cricket"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Vic Marks","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/vicmarks"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/23/new-zealand-england-kane-williamson-trent-boult-tim-southee","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497x7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/may/23/new-zealand-england-kane-williamson-trent-boult-tim-southee","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/23/new-zealand-england-kane-williamson-trent-boult-tim-southee"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432410812482/d7783055-267b-4357-966a-f0e1281c38d0-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Alastair Cook steadied the ship in partnership with Ian Bell after New Zealand had threatened to blow England away.

They cruised into the Premiership final – for only the second time – and every one of those England squad members played a blinder. Defensively, it was a relentless performance of graft but it was their deadly finishing that marked them out as a team at the top of their game. They visited the Leicester 22 eight times and came away with seven tries. And their only unproductive raid was with a couple of minutes left, between the sixth and seventh tries – which is to say, it did not matter a jot by then.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/23/saracens-northampton-premiership-semi-final-match-report\">Northampton 24-29 Saracens | Premiership semi-final match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Matt Banahan scored a hat-trick, the first in a Premiership semi-final, George Ford kicked six out of seven and Jonathan Joseph gave reassurance that in this form Manu Tuilagi’s off-field indiscretions should be of no consequence come the autumn. “I think that was the best team performance I’ve presided over,” said Mike Ford, “considering the occasion, against a team who’ve been there and done it. We were so clinical that first half. And the defence when Leicester had all the ball was outstanding, even down to 13 men. The scoreboard was a bit skewed. Leicester played better than that.”</p> \n<p>That is small consolation for the Tigers. They did not know where to turn by the end, having spent the majority of the game hammering away at the Bath defence – twice as much, in fact, as Bath did at theirs. And they came away with a hiding like this.</p> \n<p>That kind of dominance tends to bring a surfeit of penalties. Leicester’s advantage in that department was 10-1 in the first half but Freddie Burns, one of those who has fallen out of the England reckoning, missed three out of four of his penalty shots at goal. Leicester missed four in total in the first 50 minutes, while their grip on the game was vice-like. But they are a team who have struggled for form all season, even if a run of seven wins from eight saw them into this semi-final.</p> \n<p>“There are no complaints at the result,” said Richard Cockerill, Leicester’s head coach. “We came here to win and controlled the game for large parts. We just didn’t have enough firepower. Once it got away from us it got away and we had no way of clawing it back. It’s very difficult when you have so much disruption through injury. That’s not an excuse. We need to improve and evolve but we’re doing that from third in the table, not seventh or eighth or ninth, and with a lot of quality to come back in.”</p> \n<p>The weather suggested a day to favour Bath and, sure enough, it was they who made the first move with a try that might serve as a sweet distillation of their season. Off clean lineout ball Kyle Eastmond punched it up in midfield, then when it came back the other way, first Ford, then Joseph pulled the remnants of Leicester’s defence out of shape with dazzling footwork before the latter sent Banahan over for his first try in the second minute – Bath’s 10, 11, 12 and 13 in perfect concert as they have been all season.</p> \n<p>Then, just as sure, Leicester cranked up the pressure in the tight. Burns missed two of his penalties in the first quarter before landing a third effort at the start of the second. All that did, though, was to coax Bath into action again, breaking the game open with two tries in five minutes. Banahan took his second, not unlike his first, before Eastmond took the third after Semesa Rokoduguni’s chip ahead. Suddenly, 10 minutes before the break, the home side had an 18-point lead.</p> \n<p>Leicester came again, of course, with renewed vigour, so much so that they forced Bath into two yellow-card offences in two minutes, Anthony Watson collecting the first, then Leroy Houston. Tom Youngs was finally worked over on the right but it was hard work against a side with two players fewer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/23/stuart-lancaster-england-rugby-world-cup-2015-team-buildup\">Stuart Lancaster determined England should stand together at World Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The pattern of the first half continued into the second, insofar as Leicester had all the ball and the kickers missed the resultant kicks. Two shots were offered up by Leicester’s dominant scrum, both missed, the second by Tommy Bell who had stepped up for Burns. And not only were the kicks missed. Leicester’s handling let them down time and again.</p> \n<p>Carl Fearns was brought on for the final quarter and he made his presence felt. His turnover lifted the siege on Bath’s line, then his half-break paved the way for Francois Louw to send Peter Stringer in for the try that finished the game off with 15 minutes left. Four visits to the Leicester 22 had yielded four tries. Two more followed from their next two visits. Ford and Rokoduguni combined down the right for Ford to run it in. Then Banahan claimed his hat-trick after trickery by Joseph and Watson, the latter rounding things off with try number seven at the end. It was a masterclass in execution, the mark of a side in the form of their lives.

At PSV Eindhoven, Ronald Waterreus used to switch on the television at all sorts of unspeakable hours to make sure his room-mate and fellow shot-stopper Georg Koch did not get a decent night’s sleep before matches.</p> \n<p>Casillas might be a lot more welcoming to a fellow <em>Madridista</em>. Then again, he might not. He took it as a personal affront the last time he was removed from the team and, whether it is true or not that he was the instigator of all those corrosive dressing-room leaks, the memory still lingers of Jos&eacute; Mourinho’s first day back at Chelsea and his change in body language when I asked him about the consequences and rancour of favouring Diego L&oacute;pez. Mourinho gave the impression that if he saw Casillas drowning in the Manzanares, 20 feet out, he would make sure to throw him a 15-foot rope.</p> \n<p>It certainly wouldn’t be straightforward for De Gea, who should also be aware that he could wear Madrid’s colours with distinction over the next decade and still find himself jeered if he dares to misjudge a cross later in his career. Casillas can tell him all about that after some of the treatment he has encountered over the past few months, whereas Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale might also testify about the way the Bernab&eacute;u crowd can be high on disdain and low on gratitude. “It is not a sane mentality,” Rinus Michels once said of Barcelona. Yet no club is more impulsive, more impatient and more prone to the <em>pa&ntilde;olada</em>, the mutinous waving of white hankies, than their great rivals.</p> \n<p>That’s the downside. The alternative argument is that Madrid is still the place in football where most of the sport’s dreamers believe they can turn into dream-makers. It is obvious why the club’s president, Florentino P&eacute;rez, is attracted to De Gea (nothing will convince me De Gea wouldn’t have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/13/real-madrid-juventus-champions-league-semi-final-match-report\">saved the shot</a> from &Aacute;lvaro Morata that got the hankies fluttering again and eliminated Madrid from the Champions League) and the unfortunate truth for United is that it would still be a shock if Van Gaal is correct and De Gea chooses to bat away Madrid’s advances.</p> \n<p>Plainly, the alternative would be a considerable setback for Van Gaal given the consistently upward trajectory of De Gea’s career since those early days in Manchester when he could be a danger to his own team and Eric Steele, then United’s goalkeeping coach, talked of him being a poor trainer, “lazy” when it came to learning English, and eating “too many tacos”. De Gea’s raw potential was always obvious but there is no point trying to airbrush out of history how vulnerable he was back then. Steele remembers that first six months as “horrendous”.</p> \n<p>His improvement since then has been phenomenal and the question for United now has to be whether there are contingency plans to make sure the process of replacing him would be as seamless as possible. Petr Cech has been mentioned as a possible replacement and it was intriguing to discover United’s chief executive, Ed Woodward, met Mourinho at a hotel in London on Friday (though the relevant people assure me it was purely a case of bumping into one another). Tottenham Hotspur have a long history of taking United’s money that means their supporters should feel slightly uneasy about the potential availability of Hugo Lloris. Yet, equally, let’s not disregard that there is also Victor Vald&eacute;s, one of the mainstays of Pep Guardiola’s great Barcelona sides, in reserve at Old Trafford. Vald&eacute;s might not be a long-term solution at the age of 33 but he has won the Ricardo Zamora trophy as the best goalkeeper in La Liga more times than anyone else and the answer might be staring United in the face if his year recovering from a knee injury has not dulled his reflexes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/23/real-madrid-getafe-martin-odegaard-la-liga-match-report\">Real Madrid 7-3 Getafe | La Liga match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There are certainly enough options to make a reasonable argument that United’s more glaring issue this summer will not theoretically be replacing De Gea but planning for the other end of the pitch and how to compensate for the fact that all three of their main strikers are, to varying degrees, on the wane.</p> \n<p>Those of us who imagined Van Gaal’s appointment might re-invigorate Robin van Persie now have to accept he will probably never be the player who bewitched Old Trafford in his first season at the club. Radamel Falcao ought to be grateful he has been spared the league’s wooden-spoon awards because of Mario Balotelli’s risible efforts at Liverpool and let’s not forget that Wayne Rooney is approaching the point of his professional life when age slowly becomes the footballer’s hardest opponent. He is 30 in October and his body shape has always made United suspect he might have to re-invent himself as a midfielder once he is on the way down.</p> \n<p>It was David Moyes who identified the lack of dynamism in United’s attack and set about exploring whether Edinson Cavani might be the answer. Falcao was supposed to bring his own stardust but United have not scored any more freely this season than under Moyes, currently two short of last year’s total of 64, and the presence of so many high-reputation strikers seems to have disguised a revealing truth since Sir Alex Ferguson ushered himself into retirement with a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/may/19/west-bromwich-albion-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">5-5 draw at West Brom</a> two years ago. Manchester City have amassed 183 league goals since then. Liverpool have 152, Arsenal 135 and Chelsea, the boring so-and-sos, 141. United have managed 126.</p> \n<p>Memphis Depay might help to make up the shortfall but there is still some way to go bearing in mind that in Ferguson’s last eight years the team averaged 80 league goals per season. It is now around the low-60s and, unfortunately for Falcao, the chances of United completing the &pound;43.2m deal to sign him from Monaco beyond the current loan arrangement are somewhere between non-existent and miniscule.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/23/premier-league-fans-verdict-manchester-united-west-ham\">Premier League fans’ verdicts part 2: Manchester United to West Ham</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/21/radamel-falcao-colombia-confidence-jose-pekerman-manchester-united\">Falcao’s decline</a> has been so difficult on the eye that he is now attracting the one thing no footballer ever wants – pity – and there are people at Old Trafford who have started talking about his inadequacies in a way that reminds me of how Alvy Singer, Woody Allen’s character, used to excuse Annie Hall’s erratic parking. “That’s OK,” Alvy said. “We can walk to the kerb from here.”</p> \n<p>De Gea is a different matter entirely and it would be intriguing to know exactly <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/22/louis-van-gaal-david-de-gea-manchester-united\">why Van Gaal believes the Spaniard will opt to remain in Manchester</a> when the lesson of history is that Madrid generally get what they want. He is not, however, as irreplaceable as some people appear to believe. For United, the greater issue might actually be returning to the days when it would have felt implausible that their best player was their goalkeeper.</p> \n<h2>The conspiracy of poppycock <br /></h2> \n<p>Better late than never, Jos&eacute; Mourinho has finally accepted it was disingenuous to allege there was a campaign among the Premier League’s higher authorities to nobble Chelsea’s title challenge through the kind of refereeing mistakes that invariably happen to every club over the course of the season.</p> \n<p>“Maybe ‘campaign’ is not a nice word,” Mourinho said. “Maybe I would take that word out from my explanation and my comments, but that [bad decisions] is the reality. We had very bad decisions over a big period of time. But I also made bad decisions, no problem.”</p> \n<p>By Mourinho’s standards, that is straying dangerously close to a climbdown but what a pity he had to wait until now before accepting he was wrong. It was five months ago when he first made that complaint and the timing of his latest comments, just as Chelsea are preparing to be reunited with the championship trophy, merely firms up the suspicion that it was always a deliberate ploy to put pressure on referees and “get an advantage”, to use the description of Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City.</p> \n<p>It’s an old trick and Mourinho won’t be the last to use it but he has gone further than anyone else when it comes to pushing it to the next level. It rubs a bit thin, therefore, that he should withdraw the allegation now everything is done, and we can only cling to the faint hope he tries to behave with a little more decorum next season (fat chance, I know).</p> \n<p>At other times, Mourinho has lumped in the media and in particular Sky’s television pundits as further evidence that there is a concerted conspiracy against his club. It was poppycock and he knew it all along.</p> \n<h2>Dead man walking <br /></h2> \n<p>Sam Allardyce has been a good manager and sometimes a very good manager even if not quite as good as he appears to believe. He has certainly done more good than bad for West Ham United but it has been obvious for a long time that the club have lost faith in him and merely been waiting for his contract to run down so they could ease him off the premises, free of compensation. West Ham have duly gone from a side that took 31 points from their first 17 matches to one that has been in relegation form since Christmas with 16 points from the following 20 games. That is almost certain to finish with the guillotine coming down on Allardyce’s reign on Monday but, in fairness to him, is it any wonder his players have lost their focus when they have known for months, like everyone else, that he was a dead man walking?</p> \n<h2>Memories of Mackay <br /></h2> \n<p>Alex Montgomery, one of the great Fleet Street veterans, told a lovely story during the Football Writers’ Association dinner about a trick Dave Mackay used to play on nights out when he would ask for someone to toss a coin in his direction.</p> \n<p>Mackay would trap it on his shoe to begin with. He would then flip it up on to his forehead and slide it down over one eye. Finally, he would drop it into his top pocket.</p> \n<p>Mackay was known more for his strength and force of personality rather than juggling skills but it was a reminder he deserves to be remembered for more than just that photograph he disliked so much of him and Billy Bremner.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432389269339/David-de-Gea-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Worth a big hand; goalkeeper David de Gea has been Manchester United’s outstanding player this season.

With his Southend side looking like suffering play-off heartache for the third time in the last four seasons, the 55-year-old must have thought their luck was out. But less than an hour later Brown was on the Wembley turf where he won promotion to the Premier League with Hull back in 2008 savouring the acclaim of his supporters as the Shrimpers finally ensured they will return to League One for the first time in five seasons.</p> \n<p>“You can’t write the script. I wouldn’t swap this day for anything,” Brown said. “It’s very difficult. The last time I was here with Hull it was a great day. This is even greater but I feel desperately sorry for Wycombe because they’ve had a fabulous year.”</p> \n<p>After 46 matches that saw them finish the season level on points in League Two was followed by 120 minutes of nerve-jangling tension at Wembley, these two teams could not be separated. They eventually were by the 16th penalty of a shootout that first saw Wycombe go ahead after Ben Coker’s effort was saved, only for misses from Matt Bloomfield and Sam Wood to give Southend victory.</p> \n<p>Unlike when he took to the microphone to celebrate Hull’s top-flight survival, however, this time Brown refused to break into a song and instead reserved his sympathy for his opposite number, Gareth Ainsworth, with whom he had stood shoulder to shoulder watching the shootout.</p> \n<p>Brown said: “The one guy I feel for in this world is Gareth. It’s an awful way to end a season. We both said that we wouldn’t go overboard, whoever wins it. It’s in the lap of the gods and it was. The young lads and the old lads showed a lot of character to win the game. To get the equaliser in the 122nd minute shows what we’re about. |</p> \n<p>“We’ve got to dust ourselves down in the summer and come back in League One. That’s what we set out to achieve at the start of the season and that’s what we’ve done today.”</p> \n<p>Ainsworth is no stranger to the world of music either, having given up rehearsing for his heavy metal band Road to Eden to concentrate on preparing his side for this match. Wycombe’s transformation from escaping relegation from the Football League last season to the verge of promotion 12 months later has been remarkable and their manager paid tribute to his players’ efforts. “It’s devastating to lose but I’m ready now to build; we’ve had a phenomenal season,” he said. “The players have given it everything and haven’t got anything out of it but I’ll be telling them to remember how far we have come in the last 12 months. I’m proud of them. We were part of a momentous battle today.”</p> \n<p>A dour first half had ended with Southend feeling rightly aggrieved after being denied what looked a perfectly good goal from Barry Corr. They continued to create the better chances after the break and should have been awarded a penalty when Joe Jacobson pushed Corr in the box. But Wycombe also had their chances to win it in normal time and Brown was thankful for Dan Bentley’s last-ditch save from Aaron Pierre to take the game into extra time.</p> \n<p>It looked as though the Southend keeper would have a day he would never forget for all the wrong reasons. He deflected Jacobson’s 25-yard free-kick into his own net to give Wycombe an extra-time lead. But with 24 seconds left on the clock the substitute Joe Pigott kept his nerve to take the game to penalties and leave Wycombe wondering what might have been.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/23/1432411295625/Southend-United-v-Wycombe-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Southend's players celebrate their League One playoff victory against Wycombe Wanderers at Wembley.
