The confirmation that the Open Championship’s live television rights in the United States have been renewed – adding to the hundreds of millions of dollars this will mean for one of golf’s ruling bodies over a 12-year period – was a nod to NBC’s desperation to land a deal which ESPN was indifferent towards. However, TV executives are not devoid of all sense: the deal also illustrated the appeal of golf in the long term, when Woods will no longer be a factor.</p> \n<p>While there is no precise time frame for the end of the Woods era, his struggles on the course mean competitively Rory McIlroy, Rickie Fowler, Jordan Spieth and their peers dominate the narrative. For all those who believe golf cannot prevail without Woods, or even someone approaching his status, there is regular evidence to the contrary. The sport, just like any, evolves, as it did when Jack Nicklaus edged into retirement.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/09/tiger-woods-us-open-poor-form\">Tiger Woods takes the positives before US Open despite his poor form</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There may not be anyone like Woods soon, there may never be, but golf need not vanish from the sporting radar because of that. Other features, such as the time it now takes to complete rounds and the cost of equipment, are more damaging to golf’s evolution than the regression of a marquee figure. The trouble is people seem scared to admit as much, both in fear of writing off Woods and examining the broader subjects golf must battle.</p> \n<p>Scrutiny of Woods’s game is increasingly uncomfortable. At the Memorial last weekend, a venue where he used to be able to prevail for fun, the 39-year-old followed up a Saturday 85 with a Sunday playing on his own, <a href=\"http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2488964-tiger-woods-at-memorial-tournament-2015-sunday-leaderboard-score-reaction\" title=\"\">the odd man out at the tail end of the field</a>. He was unable to progress from that position. Four rounds, 302 shots – 29 worse off than the play-off competitors, Justin Rose and David Lingmerth. For the first time in his career, Woods made six double bogeys or worse in a single event.</p> \n<p>Discussion of Woods before the US Open, which next week he will seek to win for a fourth time, at Chambers Bay in Washington state, is of the freakish kind. But he will seek to win it: despite every blow to his confidence, the mindset of chasing success apparently never wavers. Onlookers, meanwhile, are left asking whether he may make the cut and how badly he might score on a venue which, if the USGA is true to form, will not be even close to forgiving.</p> \n<p>If you are fond of betting on the ludicrous scenario, Woods is priced between 40 and 66-1 to end his major-winning wait on the outskirts of Seattle. The sad thing is, this is not exaggeration. And it is sad; the fall from grace of a once magical sportsman cannot be regarded as pretty viewing.</p> \n<p>Woods probably felt compelled to end an absence from competitive action, as was the case at this year’s Masters. He seemed to feel a form of duty, not only to himself, but to golf. It is also admirable that he is willing to perform under the scrutiny which surrounds his every move, amid a realisation that only tournament play will reveal his current level.</p> \n<p>The problem, though, is there is no clear sign of improvement. After eight months with another coach, Chris Como, and despite regular utterances to the contrary, you would struggle to pinpoint any area of technical progression. If disastrous stretches of holes were offset by routine brilliance, there would be cause for optimism. But they are not.</p> \n<p>Woods gives the impression of being technically muddled – a strange scenario for someone so naturally gifted. Extended breaks, whether through fitness ailments or a desire to have his golf “tournament ready”, have made no material difference at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-85890e46-b1bd-4d2d-a657-68ad5eca5fbe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433941356774/d0657884-b6c5-40d0-a12e-3a72dd078a10-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"tiger woods\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tiger Woods during the final round of the Memorial, where he played the final round on his own and remained in 71st and last place.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas J. Russo/USA Today Sports</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Nick Faldo has asked how much more Woods, now ranked 181 in the world, “can handle all of this”. Brandel Chamblee, a respected analyst for the Golf Channel, pointedly added that: “Time hasn’t done this to Tiger. He has done this to himself”. The latter point is a nod towards Woods’s desire to constantly remodel what was already a dominant golf game. In his defence, injury was a mitigating factor.</p> \n<p>As he lurches from embarrassment to embarrassment, the logical question to ask is how long Woods might give himself to get it right. His greatness is undeniable, but so too is the fact Woods cannot call on his once imperious touch any more. This process of making up the numbers in tournaments he used to win will torture Woods, one of the most ferociously competitive players who has ever lived.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/06/tiger-woods-worst-round-career-85-memorial\">Tiger Woods slumps to worst round of career with 85 at Memorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>That is all as relevant to those confidently predicting some sort of imminent return to winning form as to Woods himself. In a season and a half, Woods is a combined 51 over par in PGA Tour events. He insists rankings are not a fair reflection of where he is. Bare facts show the likes of Inhoi Hur, Troy Merritt, Benjamin Herbert, Scott Pinckney and Wade Ormsby ahead of him. The list goes on and on.</p> \n<p>So for how long does he persist? This US Open promises to be a footnote. The Open Championship at St Andrews already bears resemblance to a line in the sand. In 2000 and 2005, he won, by eight and five shots respectively, at the Old Course. Even Woods himself will inevitably glance back to the peak of his powers when returning to Fife next month.</p> \n<p>At a venue he could at one time have successfully negotiated using hickory-shafted clubs and tennis balls, further failure would be a cruel blow. History, that great ally of this 14-times major champion, warns us against writing him off. The trouble is, that past is being constantly outweighed by a reality that cannot go on for ever and, in the wider sense, does not need to.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433941310678/e5dff3b8-1d25-4d3a-bd99-717b2420dae8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sam Greenwood/Getty Images","altText":"A solemn Tiger Woods acknowledges the crowd on the 18th hole during the final round of The Memorial Tournament.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sam Greenwood/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/10/1433940885810/tiger-woods-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tiger Woods during the final round of the Memorial, where he played the final round on his own and remained in 71st and last place.

The scheme allegedly began when Messi was a minor. Both Messi and his father have denied any wrongdoing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/nov/21/lionel-messi-may-leave-spain-tax-barcelona-football\">Lionel Messi may leave Spain over tax jail threat</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In October last year, Jorge Messi told Spanish radio his son had no knowledge of any such scheme. “I have always said it, he had absolutely nothing to do with it, so there is no need to talk about it,” he said. “My lawyers are dealing with this issue so it’s something with me and has nothing to do with him.”</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the court said that while it was understandable Messi would not handle his own finances, the player should not be granted impunity because he had no knowledge of what was going on. The court stressed it was not in the position to decide whether Messi was aware of the fraud or not, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/10/inenglish/1433935729_245719.html\" title=\"\">according El Pa&iacute;s</a>.</p> \n<p>Messi’s defence had argued the player had “never devoted a minute of his life to reading, studying or analysing” the contracts. However, judges noted Messi had ratified the contracts when he turned 18 and he was listed as the sole administrator of one of the companies.</p> \n<p>In October of last year, a court in Gava, near Barcelona, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/oct/03/lionel-messi-appeal-tax-fraud-rejected\" title=\"\">ruled the 27-year-old should face trial over the allegations</a>, regardless of whether or not he was aware of the alleged tax fraud. At the time, Messi released a statement announcing his intention to appeal against the ruling.</p> \n<p>It was this appeal that was rejected on Wednesday. Despite voluntary payments of more than €5m to Spanish tax authorities in the past year – representing the €4.1 of alleged unpaid taxes plus interest – the court said Messi and his father remain under investigation for three counts of tax fraud.</p> \n<p>The court’s decision cannot be appealed against. There is still the possibility an out-of-court settlement could be reached, but it could be complicated by the state attorney’s insistence on pushing forward with the accusations. Spain’s public prosecutor has recommended the charges be dismissed, arguing that Messi’s father was solely responsible for the family’s finances.</p> \n<p>The court decision comes only days after Barcelona clinched the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/07/barcelona-champions-league-final-juventus-lionel-messi\" title=\"\">Champions League</a>.

Finn’s dismissal of McCullum all but stopped the chase in its tracks even given the potential of Martin Guptill’s hitting prowess.</p> \n<p>It certainly provided an ideal environment for Rashid with his leg-spin. He bowled very nicely, showing deceptive variations and some decent spin, and with his runs was a plausible candidate for man of the match. But the clamour that is already there for his instant inclusion in the Test side is heaping too much expectation on him and getting way ahead of the game.</p> \n<p>It is four years since I found myself writing an optimistic piece about Scott Borthwick perhaps having the potential to become the first English wrist-spinner since Tommy Greenough, in 1959, to take five wickets in a Test innings. That prospect fizzled out and last season he managed only 13 wickets for Durham at more than 58 runs apiece: his batting has become his forte instead.</p> \n<p>As an aside, the most prolific wrist-spinners for England since Doug Wright (108 wickets), the left-armer Johnny Wardle (102) and Eric Hollies (44), all in the decade after the second world war, have not been the obvious ones (Robin Hobbs, Ian Salisbury and Chris Schofield, all of whom were selected specifically as spinners) but the opening batsman Bob Barber, who took 42 wickets, and Ken Barrington, who managed 29.</p> \n<p>In Ian Peebles (45), Len Braund (47), Walter Robins (64) and Tich Freeman (66) you have the only wrist-spinners to have taken more wickets for England than Barber. As a contrast there are 25 finger-spinners with more than him, of whom 15 have more wickets than Wright. A lack of quality wrist spin is scarcely a new phenomenon.</p> \n<p>Even back in the Caribbean, where Rashid was selected for the Test tour but did not play, it was felt by some of the management that he could have a stronger part to play in England’s limited-overs cricket. For spinners, particularly those who can turn the ball either way, have tended to thrive in the format, largely because of the imperative for batsmen to attack and the preponderance of boundary fielders.</p> \n<p>On the other hand Test cricket – as New Zealand and most recently England have shown – can be adventurous, but it still remains a world away from the white-ball game. Unless there was a pitch that was so obviously going to turn significantly (the UAE in October might be a case in point) then, particularly in this country, the bowling is always going to be dominated by seamers, with a spinner largely required to play a holding role until the latter stages of the match.</p> \n<p>There is certainly a case for saying he could play a part in winkling out the tail, something that has eluded England for several years now, but technically, in terms of his default pace, he may allow Test match batsmen too much time. He really cannot play as a single spinner and in general, unless the seamers would be largely redundant once the new ball had gone, he would unbalance the team as a second spinner.</p> \n<p>For now, best to enjoy what Rashid is doing in the happy environment in which he finds himself. Test cricket is no longer the benchmark against which a cricketer should be judged.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945187320/Adil-Rashid-England-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The clamour for England to include Adil Rashid, left, pictured high-fiving with Chris Jordan at Edgbaston, in the Test side is heaping too much expectation on him and getting ahead of the game.

In Sydney, the real estate boom has gentrified boxing’s inner-city heartland, moving it to clusters in the distant outer suburbs, and 40 kilometres out west, Blacktown has become the new epicentre of Australian boxing. The Vinegar Hill Boxing Gym sits in the heart of a dusty industrial area, in the roof cavity at the back of a concrete factory wedged between exhaust muffler and scrap metal dealers. It is named after the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Vinegar_Hill\">1798 Battle of Vinegar Hill</a> – the last stand of the Irish Rebels against the English and its local namesake, the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castle_Hill_convict_rebellion\">1804 Battle of Vinegar Hill</a> when the British Colonial army crushed an Irish convict rebellion nearby. The gym reeks of struggle.<br /></p> \n<p> The posters hanging off the cinder blocks surrounding the ring are old-school – Thomas Hearns, Mike Tyson, Roberto Duran, Sugar Ray Leonard, Muhammad Ali, Sonny Liston. It is a surreal yet suitable habitat for a boxing blue blood, Nigel Benn, nicknamed the Dark Destroyer and at his peak one of England’s most recognisable sporting heroes. Benn’s record as an amateur boxer was 41-1 before he turned professional in 1987. Over a nine-year career he won two world titles, at middleweight and super middleweight, and finished with a professional career record of 42-5-1 with 35 knockouts. </p> \n<p> Trainer Rod Williams waits patiently on the ropes for Benn’s private training session to start. Williams is a wiry and wise South African who moved to Australia from the tough streets of Johannesburg at the age of 10. A champion coach, he has devoted his life to the fight game and now trains a stable of rookies and elite amateurs including Benn’s son Conor. Benn was so impressed at Williams’s work with his son that he joined the stable himself to keep learning. </p> \n<p>Williams trains champions like Benn, but he also works with novice fighters. “They are the ones who teach me how to teach,” he says. Since taking on Benn over a year ago, Williams has been shocked at his ability to do new things. “He could easily have played the old dog you can’t teach new tricks to, but in every single session he’s done everything I’ve asked,” says Williams. “He has never put the ‘I’m the Dark Destroyer’ on me. He’s good that way. For a man over 50 his stamina and strength is amazing.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90681ca1314927b66512cbba2b23381322dd8652\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/90681ca1314927b66512cbba2b23381322dd8652/0_57_2953_1912/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benn working the pads with trainer Rod Williams.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"647\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benn working the pads with trainer Rod Williams.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Inside the ring, Benn explodes into action. The stereo blares while Williams calls the shots and Benn obliges. Conor leans on the ropes watching his father’s every move. Conor has now had 20 amateur fights and is planning to join the Hatton Academy in Manchester run by former world champion Ricky Hatton. “I still watch my father’s fights” Conor says with smile. “I look up to him and he’s my inspiration. I didn’t know how big he was growing up in Spain. Until we went to England and everybody wanted a photo – it was bizarre. Look at him – he’s still looking good!”</p> \n<p> Benn Snr is in mint condition and throwing thunderclap straight rights into the pads, working feverishly through three-minute rounds with half-minute rests. Between rounds, Williams chimes in: “Conor brings a lot to the table genetically but gets no special privileges.” “He’s got the DNA!” shouts Benn, sweating profusely, but Williams continues. “Conor loves it to death but he has to be patient.”</p> \n<p> The buzzer rings and the gruelling rounds continue. Williams has his eyes closed now as Benn machine guns short punches into the pads before exploding with a series of vicious left hooks. Williams stops Benn mid-round to explain an adjustment in angles. Benn soaks it in: “I got you, I see what you mean.” As the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> round looms, Benn finishes with a furious flurry that goes one minute over time. “That’s what an old man can do!” he yells. Towelling off the sweat, he invites my questions: “Bring it on!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"962f64d59c54d91236d6dbf2c01f86ddbc35d305\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/962f64d59c54d91236d6dbf2c01f86ddbc35d305/0_126_2953_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"“It’s all in the mind,” says Benn to the photographer as he hurtles through his training regime.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"624\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“It’s all in the mind,” says Benn to the photographer as he hurtles through his training regime.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Born in 1964 in Ilford in east London to immigrant parents from Barbados, Benn was brought up in Essex before moving to Spain and then settling in Australia in 2013: “Tell you the truth my wife Carolyne suggested it,” Benn says. “I said to her ‘Australia? You must be mad, everything’s venomous’. Then I worked through it. We black men don’t surf so that ruled out sharks.” Eventually, he was convinced. Twelve years in Spain was enough, and it was easy to communicate in Australia. His first day in Sydney had a huge impact. He remembers ordering fried rice in English from a Chinese waiter. “I thought, ‘Here we are!’” he says. “I fell in love with it all – the size of the beaches, the big blue sky, the barbecues and focus on families getting together.”</p> \n<p> Benn left painful memories back in England. At the age of eight his hero older brother Andy was killed suspiciously and violently at just 17, and a hole was created that nothing could fill. “Something severed when my brother died,” he says. “I was living but not living. Andy used to lie on the bunk bed and cuddle me – I was his lion cub. He had proper respect in Ilford. I was a scared little boy who didn’t want to die. I cried myself to sleep every night.”</p> \n<p> After Andy’s death, Benn began smoking, hustling on the street, and eventually continuing his brother’s work fighting against the National Front racist skinheads. “The black and white communities would come to together at Ilford Town Hall to listen to soul music and they [the skinheads] would wait for us outside,” says Benn. “I was into Bruce Lee at the time and I remember knocking one skinhead out with a hop, skip and a jump through the air and my leg cracked him.” Benn remembers shouting: “I was born here mate. I’m more English than you are.”</p> \n<p> School was a blur as he roamed the streets until the early hours of the morning. Even though he went wild fighting on the streets, Benn’s staunch father was there for him with some tough love Bajan style. Benn smiles. “I would get in some trouble, my father would hear about it and when I got back home he would bellow in a thick Bajan accent ‘If you can’t hear you can feel’, followed by a clip. He gave it to me but I still respect him today.”</p> \n<p> The value of his father’s discipline became apparent later in life. “I didn’t understand at the time but later he explained it to me. He said by hook or crook, you’re not going to end up like your brother.” Benn’s father insisted he join his older brother in the British Army and he took to “squaddie” life with relish, kicking off his boxing career and surviving some harrowing times in Northern Ireland including losing friends in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droppin_Well_bombing\">Ballykelly bombing</a>. “I was just a brother wanting to do my time and get out,” he says. After almost five years Benn left the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers with an exemplary record, tried security but was lured into professional boxing, skyrocketing to a 22-0 record and building a reputation as an exciting puncher with a growing fanbase.</p> \n<p> It all came crashing down when he was “<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rope-a-dope\">rope-a-doped</a>” brilliantly by fellow Brit Michael Watson and having punched himself out, was knocked out himself. “I had some friends who disappeared to hang out with Michael,” says Benn, who sat alone in the change room after the fight. “I didn’t want to leave the house and decided to go to America.” The experience was an epiphany and defeat can be instructive. “I’d been lying to myself about how good I was.”</p> \n<p>Boxing was different in America. “It’s the land of truth over there,” says Benn. “Guys off the street can give you a tough spar. Reputations mean nothing.” But the move paid off. He won the world middleweight title against Doug De Witt in New Jersey in 1990. In his first defence he brutalised fearsome Iran “the Blade” Barkley in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-wpk99I3Q8\">famous one round war</a> that made him an international star. When Barkley looked away from him at the weigh-in, Benn knew he had his man.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5522f50d70bb2c0e7046251a3451d0781ae4487\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a5522f50d70bb2c0e7046251a3451d0781ae4487/0_336_3828_2298/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benn v Eubank in November 1990.

It was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7to-Ch5Omaw\">a violent, brutal fight</a>, the British Bulldog versus the American Pitbull, and Benn was bludgeoned near unconscious and out of the ring in the first round before getting himself back into the contest, roared on by a partisan crowd. McClellan eventually retired on one knee in the 10th round, dehydrated, confused and blinking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a906bbfeb7352bd33c10d02f6461e81ca84ed7c2\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/a906bbfeb7352bd33c10d02f6461e81ca84ed7c2/398_140_1131_1490/759.jpg\" alt=\"Benn launches a counter-attack during his 1995 fight with Gerald McClellan in London. \" width=\"759\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benn launches a counter-attack during his 1995 fight with Gerald McClellan in London. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> British fight writer Hugh Mcilvanney described the fight as “relentless, mutually destructive aggression…one of the most brutal fights any of us at ringside had witnessed.” McClellan was rushed to hospital cutting Benn’s celebrations short. He had scored one of the bravest, most dramatic victories in English sporting history – a titanic struggle and the devil took the hindmost. Benn had a damaged nose and jaw, urinated blood for three days and had a shadow on the brain. The fight left McClellan blind, 80% deaf and paralysed in a wheelchair, in the care of his sisters.</p> \n<p>This year marks 20 years since McClellan was paralysed. Eight years ago Benn returned to England to raise $250,000 to assist McClellan’s care. In an emotional reunion, Benn was granted forgiveness by McClellan’s sister, who once told the media “We want Benn dead, we want his money”, and, “How does a man who almost killed a man sleep at night?” To see <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYCFR1KrD6g&amp;t=32m19s\">Benn and McClellan embrace</a> is one of the most moving moments in boxing history with the latter in his wheelchair asking: “Am I handsome?” </p> \n<p>“It’s my greatest moment in the ring but I can’t celebrate it,” says Benn. “I’ve done what I can and I’m grateful it’s been laid to rest. It’s a cross I have to bear but ultimately I’m here to support my family.” Benn was never the same again and his career soon ended. Without the discipline of boxing his life descended into a path well trodden of chaos featuring drugs, cheating, fast women and slow horses. Famously, Benn was once quoted as saying: “I was Satan’s right hand man.” He suffered depression and attempted suicide one lonely night in the car. Rock bottom is a good foundation and Benn found salvation in religion joining a long line of religious boxers including Evander Holyfield and George Foreman.</p> \n<p> In an attempt to expel his demons Benn left his marital home and went to live with his pastor who assigned him to a 63-year-old woman. “She broke me down slowly,” he says with a wince. “She made me deal with my unresolved issues with drugs, sex addiction and the anger at the loss of my brother. No more spliffs, no more cheating, no more swearing. Get this. I was only allowed to watch Little House on the Prairie and loved it. I’ve got all 11 seasons on DVD!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"aa49de6a034d32456106df0255ea17d04ba64141\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/aa49de6a034d32456106df0255ea17d04ba64141/0_0_2953_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A portrait of former Benn after his workout.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A portrait of former Benn after his workout.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Benn interrupts the memories, checking his watch. “We’re late for Blacktown PCYC, let’s go,” he says. Blacktown Police Youth Citizens Club is one of the most diverse sports clubs in Australia, a kaleidoscope of cultures blending together daily. Presiding over operations at her front office desk is community veteran club manager Jo Tau, a Samoan Dutch Kiwi who has one eye on her computer and the other keeping track of movement in the centre. She has no doubt of the importance of the PCYC. “More than once community tensions have calmed down when the different groups have met here or know each other from here,” she says. “Most recently we had some tension between the South Sudanese and Pacific Communities and leaders from our club helped return things to normal.”</p> \n<p> Tau remembers how Benn built the relationship with her and her husband, coming over to their house and cooking for the pair. “A world champion, in our little shack!” she says excitedly. “Nigel is a very humble man and has a presence about him that brings people in. I’ve had clients in my office who have nearly dropped to the floor like screaming schoolgirls when they’ve seen him. We’ve got a world champ interacting with our kids and adults, in of all places, Blacktown!” Pointing upstairs to the thudding boxing gym, she says: “His culture up there is all about family. We see the power of boxing here to engage youth. It’s not just something anyone can do and Nigel doesn’t sugarcoat, he gives it to them big time.”</p> \n<p> Benn has also helped out with at-risk youth and Tau is thrilled with the results. She says 30 disengaged kids who stopped going to school were spellbound by Benn’s presence after seeing highlights of his career. “Every time they are quiet, no fidgeting,” she says. “He shares his stories from the heart, then has a big laugh with all of them at the sausage sizzle afterwards. And sure enough some of them go back to school. He’s here to make a difference and he has been changing lives here for more than two years.”</p> \n<p> The upstairs boxing gym is bristling with feverish hustle, the windows foggy and the air larded with the aroma of toil. Around the ring fighters are lined up to do one round on the pads with Benn, whilst some are skipping and others thudding the heavy bags monotonously – the echoes of aspiration. A grandmother in a hijab looks on and smiles as her two grandsons wrestle a big punching bag. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"774cdc52409b22827d38296ff2ff3e32ee61e219\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/774cdc52409b22827d38296ff2ff3e32ee61e219/0_0_2953_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conor Benn (standing, left), son of Nigel Benn, is among those training at Blacktown PCYC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conor Benn (standing, left), son of Nigel Benn, is among those training at Blacktown PCYC.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Legen Hale arrived in Australia in January 2015, a proud Maori from Hamilton, New Zealand, and overweight at 150 kilograms. By his own admission he had no discipline and focus and came to Australia to turn his life around. Five months after first arriving at Blacktown PCYC, Hale has lost 45 kilograms under the tough love of the Dark Destroyer. “Nigel pushed me to the limit and stood by me on a hard journey. Every day he was on me,” says Hale. “My clothes are loose, I’ve got a great job, my own car, I’m moving faster, concentrating more. At the weekly weigh-in Nigel would look me in the eye and say – ‘You can’t lie to me, you’re just lying to yourself’.” Eventually Hale broke: “Finally I got discipline and accountability and I have a platform,” he says. “I’m now mentoring some youth myself and hope to have my first fight in five months. Crazy stuff.”</p> \n<p> Suddenly the gym lights up as one of the serious fighters does a round of padwork in the ring with Benn. The blows are loud and crisp and the children stop to watch. Gavin Smith has Brazil 2016 Olympic dreams. He has had 18 amateur fights for Blacktown PCYC and is the current ABL junior welterweight champion. “Nigel has been in my corner for at least 10 fights,” says Smith. “We rock up to a small town in the middle of nowhere and I walk in to the ring with his hand on my shoulder. By the time I reach the ring I’m 10 foot tall.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57498285c590bdf31d9bc19df2d2651e147c3617\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/57498285c590bdf31d9bc19df2d2651e147c3617/0_0_2953_1969/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Benn training amateur fighter Gavin Smith at the Blacktown PCYC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Benn training amateur fighter Gavin Smith at the Blacktown PCYC.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Some of the fights involve road trips of hundreds of kilometres during which Benn shares his wisdom. “He never talks about my opponent,” says Smith. “He says, ‘Relax, you’ve done the hard work. This is the easy part’. He is so enthusiastic, so passionate and encourages you to give everything. Go home, eat right, stay out of trouble. Discipline and focus. He makes us believe in ourselves.” When Smith won the state title, Benn jumped in the ring and hoisted him up on his shoulders to celebrate. “I’m the NSW champ, I’m sitting on Nigel Benn’s shoulders having just executed his game plan using some tricks he taught me,” says Smith. “It’s unbelievable.”</p> \n<p> As the session draws to a close, Benn is once again caked in sweat. He towels off and says goodbye to each fighter with a hug and shoulder bump and a “God bless you man.” Everyone has left the gym except for the Benn family; Conor is unwrapping his hands after a torrid session and Nigel’s youngest son and two girls are telling stories and laughing. “My new drug is serving people whether its through boxing or in my role for Hillsong as a volunteer assisting people with their marriages or helping those less fortunate,” Benn says. “I’m great friends with an 80-year-old woman whose lawn I cut and do odd jobs for. It’s a required part of the service.”</p> \n<p> Behind every redemption story is a rock. In this case it’s Benn’s wife Carolyne. “I look at women differently now,” he says. “More respectful. And I just love my wife, man.” Despite his past, Benn is optimistic for the future. “Boxing has helped millions around the world as a trigger for self belief, identity and connecting. It is therapy for rage,” he says.</p> \n<p> Religion has helped Benn overcome the sadness and anger of losing his brother. “The man upstairs has filled the hole left by my brother’s death,” he says. <br /> Life seems good. “I won two world titles and filled Old Trafford, owned a Bentley and a mansion, had tea at Buckingham Palace, DJ’d at Ministry of Sound, served proudly in the British Army and here I am cutting the grass of an 80-year-old woman,” he says. </p> \n<p>“And lovin’ it. I look at my life now and I feel blessed, no more drugs or smoking, I’m fittest I’ve ever been. Look at my family. I can’t ask for more.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/532da7aa11eeeb74cc85fe850d6eb5c78390b366/0_85_2953_1776/2953.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1776,"width":2953,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Matthew Abbott for the Guardian","altText":"Former boxer Nigel Benn in the ring at Blacktown PCYC after a long afternoon of training and teaching.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Matthew Abbott for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/90681ca1314927b66512cbba2b23381322dd8652/0_57_2953_1912/2953.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1912,"width":2953,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Benn working the pads with trainer Rod Williams.

The Cavs imposed their will on the Warriors and never let up.<br /></p> \n<p>Aside from a 13-2 run which found the Warriors just down by one with about five minutes to go, the Cavs dominated and had a determination that was evident from the get-go.</p> \n<p>And once again, the gritty and undrafted Aussie guard Matthew Dellavedova continued to play his game of diving for loose balls, hitting floaters in the lane, and hitting James on a crucial alley-oop fast-break dunk in the fourth quarter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"40ffbfe7fd83c7080c52619ac07a34a51981debf\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/40ffbfe7fd83c7080c52619ac07a34a51981debf/0_47_4710_2825/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steph Curry scored 27 points but Golden State’s rally came too late.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steph Curry scored 27 points but Golden State’s rally came too late.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Golden State scored 37 points and shot just 34% from the field in the first half, and that bad start was just too much to overcome. The Cavs shut down the Warriors’ Splash Brothers, Klay Thomson and Steph Curry, in the first half, and the scoring duo had just nine points together at the half, and combining for just one of six three-pointers.</p> \n<p>The Cavs had a seven-point, 44-37 lead at half time, but they went on a 13-2 run in the third quarter that gave them an 18-point lead (68-49). James and Dellavedova found their range in the third, scoring 13 and ten points respectively. Through the third quarter, Golden State had managed just 55 points.</p> \n<p>The Warriors made several runs in the fourth – one being a 15-3 run – cutting the lead to three points at about the five-minute mark. But a key exchange came when Curry missed a three-pointer, and then Delladedova took the rebound on a fast break and tossed a lay-up to James. The lead was back to five. If Curry had hit that shot, the game would have been tied and the end might have been different.</p> \n<p>Curry did hit a three-pointer to cut the lead to one, but Delladevova hit a falling down prayer shot from the lane that banked in, and he hit the foul shot for a stunning three-point play with 2:20 to go. James then cam back on the next possession after holding the Warriors scoreless, and hit a three with 1:40 left to stretch the lead to 87-80.</p> \n<p>Curry said afterwards: “On the road we have to play free have fun and be the aggressors. We just have to stay sound fundamentally and especially not make mistakes down the stretch. LeBron is making some crazy plays … we just have to match their intensity.”</p> \n<p>Delladedova finished with 20 points on 7-17 shooting. Curry scored 24 points in the second half to finish with 27.</p> \n<p>The game was not pretty for the Cavs, and they did seem disjointed in the fourth quarter as they allowed the Warriors to score 36 points. James did miss 20 shots on 14-34 shooting. Maybe complacency set in after they got their big third-quarter lead. But every time the Warriors got within shouting distance, the Cavaliers gave the ball to James and he controlled the game. James scored 27 points in the second half, and 14 in the fourth quarter.</p> \n<p>James now has 123 points in the first three games of the finals series.</p> \n<p>But the game was won with defense on the part of the Cavaliers, and it was about blocking shots and diving for loose balls and putting bodies on bodies. The teams were close in rebounds (the Warriors led 46-43 there), they were equal in turnovers (14), and the Warriors had more assists (21-15). But the Warriors shot just 40% from the field, while the Cavs shot 46%.</p> \n<p>Cavs coach Dave Blatt said afterwards that his team “just a group that plays as hard as they can. We had [the Warriors] broken – they didn’t break. We played the way we wanted to play, and it wasn’t always the best but I’ll take it every day.”</p> \n<p>Blatt also called Dellevedova the “most Cleveland-like Australian you’ll ever seen. If you’re from Cleveland, this blue-collar town, you know exactly what I mean.”</p> \n<p>James said: “It’s great to have someone out on the floor who is willing to sacrifice everything for the sake of the team.”</p> \n<p>Andre Iguodala acknowledged that the Warriors had not played well. “Small things are really biting us in the ass,” he said. “Loose balls, they are getting all of them. We’re playing against a very good team that is very underrated.”</p> \n<p>Steve Kerr, the Warriors coach, thought his team lacked something. “Steph never loses confidence. I just thought he lost a little energy, and, I don’t know, life,” he said. “We just need life from everybody, We need emotion from everybody.”</p> \n<p>Game four will be in Cleveland on Thursday.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3b92a96874c02504ee1b0a71ac05763b396b17d6/0_31_1920_1151/1920.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1151,"width":1920,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jason Miller/Getty Images","altText":"LeBron now has 123 points in the first three games of this series.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jason Miller/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/40ffbfe7fd83c7080c52619ac07a34a51981debf/0_47_4710_2825/4710.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2825,"width":4710,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Steph Curry scored 27 points but Golden State’s rally came too late.

For in Cleveland, which hasn’t won a title in a major sport since the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/cleveland\">Cleveland</a> Browns won the NFL championship in 1964, losing big games and in melodramatic ways is just par for the course. Most dedicated sports fans here (and, quite frankly, almost everyone is emotionally attached to their teams) fans figured this series was over almost before it began, and the “waiting for next year” mantra started.</p> \n <p>But sports is a fickle business for good and for ill, so Sunday night’s overtime game two win has brought the Cleveland fans off the ledge and back into celebratory mode. The win over the Warriors on Sunday night was the first <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/nba\">NBA</a> finals game win in Cavs history, and gunshots were heard in some Cleveland neighborhoods after the game two victory as if the Cavs had actually won the series.

For in Cleveland, which hasn’t won a title in a major sport since the <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/us-news/cleveland\">Cleveland</a> Browns won the NFL championship in 1964, losing big games and in melodramatic ways is just par for the course. Most dedicated sports fans here (and, quite frankly, almost everyone is emotionally attached to their teams) fans figured this series was over almost before it began, and the “waiting for next year” mantra started.</p> \n <p>But sports is a fickle business for good and for ill, so Sunday night’s overtime game two win has brought the Cleveland fans off the ledge and back into celebratory mode. The win over the Warriors on Sunday night was the first <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/nba\">NBA</a> finals game win in Cavs history, and gunshots were heard in some Cleveland neighborhoods after the game two victory as if the Cavs had actually won the series.
