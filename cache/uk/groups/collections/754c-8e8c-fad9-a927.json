No matter that Mark Sampson’s side were required to come from behind after an edgy, erratic start. More audacious tactics from the Lionesses’ young coach ultimately earned a quarter-final place.</p> \n<p>The next chapter will unfold in Vancouver on Saturday night – or the early hours of Sunday in the UK – against the host nation. By way of further spice Canada are managed by John Herdman, a Newcastle United supporter from Consett in County Durham.</p> \n<p>“The team have made history. The team deserve all the credit in the world. They knew this was a big game for them, they wanted to put their names in English football history and the squad have stepped up and delivered for the country,” said Sampson. “We’ve seen in the tournament if you concede the first goal it’s incredibly difficult to win the game. This group of 23 players have shown brilliant resilience, fantastic character and excellent game discipline to come back and win that match. We’ll take huge confidence from this victory.</p> \n<p>“It’s a squad effort, the guys on the bench were absolutely outstanding today. The impact they made again. You saw the subs and their support today. The objective was to get to Vancouver, we’re there now and we want this journey to continue.”</p> \n<p>Norwegian reporters were applying factor 50 sun block in the press box at kick off where the temperature was 27 degrees centigrade. Pleasant as it was to sit in such wonderful warmth it cannot have been so nice down on the pitch where the artificial turf boosted the ground level mercury to well over 40 degrees.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/ng-interactive/2015/jun/05/womens-world-cup-canada-2015\">Women's World Cup 2015 - interactive wallchart</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Judging by his love of tactical surprise Sampson should make a fine chess player. Here he arranged England in a flexible 4-1-4-1 with Fara Williams sitting deep, Toni Duggan the attacking spearhead and Karen Carney and Fran Kirby occupying the wide roles. Controversially there was, once again, no starting place for Jill Scott in central midfield. Indeed England’s coach has not named her in a first XI since declaring Scott to be the “midfielder of Canada 2015”.</p> \n<p>Supremely confident – although not arrogant – Norway claim they are probably the tournament’s fittest team but Isabell Herlovsen swiftly emphasised she is quick as well as athletic after pouncing on a rare Carney error. That left her accelerating towards Karen Bardsley but, reacting well to the danger, Bardsley raced off her line, cleverly narrowing the angle. Suddenly under acute pressure Herlovsen miscued and the chance was lost.</p> \n<p>When Kristine Minde eluded Claire Rafferty at the far post she was well placed to meet Solveig Gulbrandsen’s long diagonal ball. Fortunately for the Lionesses the angle was awkward and Minde could not squeeze her shot into the bottom corner.</p> \n<p>Twenty-five minutes had passed before the first water break – by which time Ingrid Hjelmseth, Norway’s goalkeeper, had frequently seemed temporarily blinded by the strong sun in her eyes. Bronze had no such excuse when her ill-judged backpass was intercepted by the menacing Ada Hegerberg who creditably stayed on her feet under pressure before shooting straight at the impressive Bardsley. England could count themselves fortunate Hegerberg – who had earlier headed a presentable chance wide – did not attempt to win a penalty.</p> \n<p>It was proving a deceptively poor England performance, although Sampson’s decision to move Katie Chapman a little deeper alongside Williams did improve things. With Lene Mykjaland having rather less room for manoeuvre than before, the Lionesses at least mustered the odd attacking move. Even so the closest they came to scoring in the first half was from a 35-yard Williams free-kick which drifted over the bar and a similarly off-target Carney shot following a corner.</p> \n<p>With hindsight Sampson, whose early game plan screamed containment, was exhibiting the patience of a skilled poker specialist but it still seemed puzzling that Scott’s classy passing and technical assurance remained on the bench.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/womens-world-cup-england-coach-mark-sampson-praises-players\">Proud Mark Sampson heaps praise on England after comeback World Cup win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Across in Norway’s dug-out Even Pellerud must have been reasonably satisfied. Norway’s coach – who led his country to World Cup glory in 1995 – will celebrate his 62nd birthday next month, making him virtually 30 years Sampson’s senior. Yet while it seemed a case of the master putting the apprentice in his place Laura Bassett and Steph Houghton, England’s central defenders, were largely preventing Pellerud’s front three from wreaking too much havoc. Or rather they were until Bardsley did well to turn Gulbrandsen’s shot round a post. When the corner was whipped in to the near post by Mykjaland, Gulbrandsen dodged Rafferty before heading Norway into a far from underserved lead.</p> \n<p>As the corner was taken Scott finally came on to replace Kirby, who had been struggling badly throughout. Norway’s goalkeeper had not had a shot to save but, against all odds, she was soon beaten. The equaliser followed another corner, won this time by Scott. Houghton timed her run to meet Williams’s delivery to perfection and her ensuing header restored parity. The moment had arrived for Sampson to liberate Jodie Taylor from the bench. The Portland Thorns striker is his most incisive forward but she underwent knee surgery only eight weeks ago and the coach could not risk sending her on in Duggan’s stead any earlier.</p> \n<p>Elise Thorsnes very nearly put Norway back into the lead only seconds after stepping off the bench but her angled shot swerved fractionally over the bar. When Bardsley was forced to save from Hegerberg England appeared up against it again but Taylor’s pace and Scott’s passing had offered them a certain momentum that was amplified as Bronze hit that eye-catching winner. Appropriately the two substitutes created the goal, Scott and Taylor combining to cue up Bronze, advanced from right-back, for a fabulous drive from the edge of the area which Hjelmseth touched but could not hold.</p> \n<p>By now Norway’s proud boast of superior fitness rang hollow. Instead Pellerud’s players looked to be running on empty and were relieved to see their keeper save well to deny Chapman. Once again Sampson, supported by Bardsley’s heroics, had confounded the doubters.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435015496209/Lucy-Bronze-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England celebrate Lucy Bronze's long-range goal against Norway which secured a first ever victory in a World Cup knockout match.

They would have been more comfortable selling Cech abroad, particularly as Paris Saint-Germain had expressed interest but the player is reluctant to uproot his family back to France where he had played at Rennes. He made clear his priority was to remain in London, further encouraging Arsenal’s conviction he will be secured this summer.</p> \n<p>While personal terms have effectively been agreed between Cech and Arsenal, at improved terms of around &pound;100,000 a week, talks between the clubs continue over the fee. Chelsea are seeking up to &pound;15m for a player who has also claimed four FA Cups, three League Cups, a European Cup and a Europa League during his time at Stamford Bridge, while Arsenal hope to pay nearer &pound;10m.</p> \n<p>Cech’s first game for Arsenal is likely to be the Community Shield against his former club at Wembley on 2 August. He may be followed to the Emirates by his goalkeeping coach, Christophe Lollichon, who could replace Swansea City-bound Tony Roberts. Mourinho already has Silvino Louro, one of his assistant first-team coaches, on his staff, though Chelsea could still recruit from outside.</p> \n<p>The decision to allow Cech to leave is considered exceptional by the Chelsea hierarchy and was effectively sanctioned by Roman Abramovich despite Mourinho’s reluctance, expressed publicly towards the end of last season, to lose him to rivals and title challengers.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/john-terry-petr-cech-arsenal\" title=\"\">John Terry echoed those sentiments on Monday</a>. “There is obviously talk of Arsenal signing Petr and, if they do get Pete, that will strengthen them for sure,” the Chelsea captain told TalkSport. “He will save them 12 to 15 points a season. I am sure if he does leave the club, which nobody wants to see even if we understand he wants to play football, he is going to be sorely missed. He will improve whatever side he goes to.”</p> \n<p>Arsenal finished 12 points behind Chelsea last season, when their goalkeeping duties were shared by Wojciech Szczesny and David Ospina. The latter may leave if Cech arrives and Fenerbahce are keen to take the Colombian to Istanbul. The champions, too, would have to enter the market to purchase a replacement and have expressed interest in Stoke’s Asmir Begovic and Rob Green at QPR.</p> \n<p>Cech lost his starting place at Chelsea at the beginning of last season after Courtois’ three-year spell on loan at Atl&eacute;tico Madrid was curtailed. Cech still went on to make 16 appearances, including in the Capital One Cup final and on the last afternoon of the season when the title was celebrated, but the club consider the Belgian first-choice for the foreseeable future. “Petr and Thibaut are up there with the best goalkeepers in the world,” Terry said. “Big Petr’s career has been at the very top.</p> \n<p>“To take Pete out of the team, you have to be a great talent.

Mike Davis, the USGA’s executive director, will feel vindicated by a championship that threw up a dramatic finale and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/jordan-spieth-credits-caddie-us-open-victory\" title=\"\">Jordan Spieth, the star attraction of American golf, as the winner</a>. “Let’s look at how the course performed because at the end of it all that trumps everything,” Davis said.</p> \n<p>As Spieth celebrated, there was further woe for Dustin Johnson. The 31-year-old had a 12ft eagle chance on the last hole to win his first major but instead three-putted. Johnson was a notable absentee from the awards ceremony but did face the media.</p> \n<p>It was merely the latest major opportunity to be passed up by Johnson. He may deny it but psychological scarring seems inevitable. “At the end of the day golf is golf. I’ve got my family and that’s most important to me,” he said. “My trophy is holding up my little son. I couldn’t be more proud of myself and my family. No matter what, I’m going to keep my head high and I’m going to be happy.”</p> \n<p>On his first putt at the last, which slid 4ft past the hole, Johnson cited possible surface influence. “I might have pulled it a little bit but still to me it looked like it bounced left,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I’m disappointed that I three-putted the last hole. Other than that I had a damn good week. I’m happy with the way I played. I’m happy with everything in my game right now. I had a chance to win again a major on a Sunday.</p> \n<p>“Starting the week all you want is a chance to have a chance to win on the back nine on Sunday. I did that. I put myself in the position. I hit the shots I needed to hit. I just didn’t get in the hole quick enough. I had a lot of putts on the back nine from six feet and in that I missed. All of them I thought I hit good putts on. I did everything I could.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435000187988/U.S.-Open---Final-Round-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Billy Horschel insisted he had 'not hit the green with his putter' at the 6th but was unhappy with the Chambers Bay course.

Berryman died on Tuesday of a heart attack in Australia, where he has been based for several years.</p> \n<p>A father of six, he had recently worked as a forklift driver in Perth, where he had also played club rugby. Umaga and others expressed shock and sadness at the passing of Berryman, who will be remembered for a flamboyant attacking style and laid-back approach off the field.</p> \n<p>A decade-long career through the 1990s included three seasons with the Crusaders, where he won three Super Rugby titles from 1998-2000. He also represented the Chiefs and Blues. Berryman’s lone Test appearance was off the reserves bench in a 24-23 loss to South Africa in 1998.</p> \n<p>“He always had a big smile,” Umaga said. “He loved life, loved his family, he’ll be a big loss. It’s a life lost too young.”</p> \n<p>Umaga was constantly amazed by Berryman’s ability to scythe through defences, belying a physique which was wider of girth than most of his peers, and admits he was embarrassed more than once defensively when the pair locked horns at provincial and Super Rugby level.</p> \n<p>“There were probably a few times where he beat me on the outside, the inside, upside-down, I’m not too sure. He was that good with his footwork. He had amazing skills for a big man.”</p> \n<p>“Stormin” Norman Berryman, as many supporters knew him, represented New Zealand Maori across an 11-year span and finished his playing career with short stints at French clubs Castres and Bourgoin.</p> \n<p>Berryman’s death follows that of another recent former All Black, Jerry Collins, who died in a car accident in France this month.

The distrust in the relationship between Madrid’s vice-captain and the president, Florentino P&eacute;rez, is not new but, with Monday morning’s front-page headlines here, it has come to the surface – making rapprochement more difficult. United may feel that their hand has been strengthened.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/manchester-united-real-madrid-david-de-gea-sergio-ramos\">Manchester United tell Real Madrid: if you want De Gea, we’ll have Ramos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Ramos has two years left on his contract at the Santiago Bernab&eacute;u but it is rare for a renewal to be allowed to run so late and negotiations have been at a standstill for some time, while the relationship between president and player has descended into bitterness, acrimony and mutual suspicion. Ten years after joining the club, Ramos is prepared to leave. The Guardian reported United’s interest on Sunday afternoon and the Spanish sports daily AS followed with the stark headline: “Sergio Ramos Wants to Go Now” on Monday morning.</p> \n<p>On the other side, underlining that this is a battle that is likely to be partly played out in public, deepening the divide between player and president, the sports supplement of the newspaper La Raz&oacute;n opened with a front-page photograph of Ramos celebrating a goal by lifting his hand to his heart, where Madrid’s badge adorns the shirt. It is accompanied by a headline that demands: “Respect the badge!”</p> \n<p>Ramos has been at Real Madrid for 10 years and scored the goal that rescued the d&eacute;cima, their 10th European Cup. He is the club’s vice-captain and has played over 400 games. He was also among those players who fell out with Jos&eacute; Mourinho and publicly defended Carlo Ancelotti. P&eacute;rez did not appreciate that, nor did he welcome Ramos’s demands during contract negotiations. Ramos earns €6m-€7m a year after tax; €12m fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo and less than Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Iker Casillas. P&eacute;rez also does not trust players who accumulate power.</p> \n<p>Ramos believes Madrid have repeatedly briefed against him in an attempt to damage his reputation and his standing with supporters, portraying him as a money-grabber not interested in the club. That sense, which has grown over recent weeks, has come to a head and was reflected in the headline in La Raz&oacute;n this morning – a newspaper that is extremely close to P&eacute;rez.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"66a14916c1bf1991cf379568d792e6ee45593e0c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434988239413/6b4cfd9a-fdc4-4aca-9655-20ba03559ab1-311x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The front page of AS featuring Ramos.\" width=\"311\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The front page of AS featuring Ramos.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In an aggressive editorial Ramos and his agent are accused of lacking commitment by Josep Pedrerol, who also hosts a TV show that has been critical of the defender and a champion of the president, while his competitors on the TV channel Cuatro are lined up on the other side. “[Ramos] will go down in history as the man who scored the goal of the d&eacute;cima,” La Raz&oacute;n’s editorial reads. “But he could also be remembered as the footballer, who while he was an idol at the [Bernab&eacute;u], auctioned himself to clubs from all round Europe for a few euros.” The suggestion that he might not respect the badge is about the gravest accusation to level at him.</p> \n<p>Last week the Barcelona presidential candidate Jordi Maj&oacute; said that he had been offered Ramos but admitted that he had not spoken to the player or indeed to the player’s agent, who insisted that the story was categorically untrue.</p> \n<p>AS, which has long been critical of P&eacute;rez and a defender of both Ramos and the goalkeeper Casillas, this morning suggested that Ramos was annoyed that Madrid did not deny the story, when other rumours have been denied and other players protected.</p> \n<p>Some supporters naturally concluded that Ramos had offered himself to Madrid’s greatest rival and that, the player’s camp suspect, is exactly the point: that not only did Madrid not deny the story, they were behind it. Real would deny that but there could be no better way of damaging his status and justifying an eventual sale that might otherwise be unpopular with supporters than releasing that rumour. It is a tactic that has been employed before. It also serves as an expression of Madrid’s annoyance at what they see as Ramos’s manner of negotiating and his refusal to accept their first offer of contract renewal.</p> \n<p>While they have not yet said anything publicly (and nor has Ramos), Madrid’s position remains that any interested clubs would have to pay the full buy-out clause, €180m, in other words the player is not for sale. And nor have they received a bid, the line goes. Meanwhile the posturing continues via third parties.</p> \n<p>“Encouraging interest from Barcelona sounds like a joke in very bad taste,” La Raz&oacute;n concluded. Ramos would probably agree, while insisting he was not responsible for doing so. The lack of trust is extreme. It has got nasty already; it may end up getting nastier. United will hope that it ends with them getting their man.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/6/22/1434987797938/Sergio-Ramos--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A parting of the ways between Real Madrid and their iconic defender Sergio Ramos appears increasingly inevitable.

Despite suggestions Russia could be stripped of the World Cup if corruption is found during ongoing investigations, the president <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/20/putin-fifa-decision-to-grant-world-cup-2018-to-russia-should-not-be-questioned\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin this weekend reiterated his commitment to holding the event, noting that stadium construction had already started</a>. The Guardian reported this month that at least 40% of the World Cup construction programme was under way or has been completed.</p> \n<p>But in an investigation published on Sunday, the respected newspaper Vedomosti reported that <a href=\"http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2015/06/22/597304-kak-v-rossii-budut-ekonomit-na-chempionate-mira-po-futbolu\" title=\"\">at least half of Russia’s World Cup stadiums were behind schedule</a> and almost all were over budget this spring, quoting an unnamed stadium designer. In particular, the rouble crisis of last year, when the currency lost more than half its value against the dollar, caused prices for largely imported equipment to rocket. According to Mikhail Khryapov, director of Stroitransgaz, which is building the stadiums in Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod, equipment prices rose by 50% and the overall cost of the project increased by 15%.</p> \n<p>In addition, World Cup construction has run into unforeseen costs and delays. For instance, builders in Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave had to spend 850 million roubles on sand to firm up the swampy ground where the World Cup stadium there is supposed to be constructed.</p> \n<p>As a result of delays and price overruns, the sports ministry allowed contractors and builders to simplify the designs, Vedomosti reported. A spokesperson for the first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, said stadium projects were cancelling extra features, using cheaper technologies, replacing imported products with local ones and re-examining contracts to try to cut out middlemen. At the same time all of Fifa’s quality and safety requirements would still be met, he said.</p> \n<p>Previously Fifa has allowed Russian organisers to reduce the planned capacity of World Cup stadium projects in Kaliningrad, Volgograd and Yekaterinburg to 35,000 rather than the standard 40,000.</p> \n<p>In a separate interview with the newspaper, Aras Agalarov, the president of Crocus Group, which is building the stadiums in Kaliningrad and Rostov-on-Don, said that after prices began to rise, <a href=\"http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/characters/2015/06/22/597305-pochemu-to-vse-zabili-chto-blatter-sdelal-dlya-mirovogo-futbola\" title=\"\">he received permission from the government to “optimise” these projects</a> to fit the previously planned budget. For instance, the number of elevators planned at the Rostov-on-Don stadium was reduced from 45 to 25, he said.</p> \n<p>According to the Vedomosti report, government agencies and building companies have claimed they were able to save significantly by replacing imports and making projects more efficient. Not all imports can be replaced, since some complicated electronics and other components are not made in Russia. But Chinese companies often produce copies of European components, and buying from them instead can reduce costs by 15% or more compared with European stadiums, according to Delovaya Rossiya, a civic organisation that promotes an open business climate.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435013256143/Vitaly-Mutko-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Russian sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said costs for the 2018 World Cup will be reduced by. among other measures, dispensing with excess hotels and reducing the number of training facilities.

Since the Amateur Boxing Association of England reformed in 2013 and became England Boxing, it has had to comply with the worldwide regulations.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/paul-smith-defeat-andre-ward-las-vegas\">Paul Smith’s time is nearly up after defeat to Andre Ward in Las Vegas | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It means English coaches – who are often involved at both levels of boxing – have had to make either professional or amateur fighters their priority. Many have been forced to concentrate on the professionals and are therefore no longer permitted to work with amateurs during competitions, resulting in a breakdown of confidence for some youngsters.</p> \n<p>Steve O’Rourke, who coaches at Wodensborough amateur boxing club in Wednesbury, West Midlands, said: “Grassroots boxing is going to suffer. Without good amateur coaches you don’t get an Amir Khan or a Carl Froch. GB and England Boxing are given diamonds to polish, it’s the normal club coaches who work hundreds of hours a year, all voluntary and free of charge. I just think we’ve been sold down the river.</p> \n<p>“Your local kids who take drugs, who get in trouble and come from poverty-stricken areas where it’s the norm to do unsociable things … people are going to close their gyms and those are the kids who will suffer.”</p> \n<p>Stefy Bull, who manages and promotes 10 professionals including Gavin and Jamie McDonnell, believes the 50 carded amateurs at his gym in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, have suffered as a result.</p> \n<p>“These kids are being kept off the street, we’re keeping them busy and active,” he said. “But first and foremost I am a professional promoter and manager. It’s my livelihood. I love the grassroots but I’ve now got no involvement in amateur boxing. I can’t go in the corner with these kids. It’s terrible, you’re trying to build relationships with these youngsters, give them confidence. It’s crazy. Apparently you can coach an amateur boxer but can’t go in their corner. You can’t get your head around it. What kind of rule is that?</p> \n<p>“If you’ve got a great relationship with a young kid, who is listening to you in the gym, has trust in you and all of a sudden after weeks together they are in a fight, they look for you and you aren’t there; how does that youngster feel when the one person they trust isn’t there when they need them? Boxing is intimidating enough, even with support.”</p> \n<p>Bull’s view is one echoed by a number of coaches across England. Dan Kelly works at Birkenhead Venture gym on Merseyside in one of the country’s most deprived areas. He said: “There have been seven or eight amateurs in recent months that have gone into tournaments without me in the corner and they have told me they’ve been devastated.</p> \n<p>“ I feel guilty. Some of them, the younger ones, don’t understand the politics of it all. Our gym is in one of the worst areas in Europe. We won a community award not so long ago for the kids we took off the streets. But we feel it’s being taken away from us by Aiba.”</p> \n<p>Tom Chaney, the head coach at Hall Green Boxing Club in Birmingham, said: “You can still coach the kids, but you can’t drive them to a venue, you can’t get them weighed in. I have had good kids leave my gym because I can’t take them in. That’s not just me, it’s around the country. It has put amateur boxing backwards. I was nearly crying in the car, they have taken everything away.”</p> \n<p>England Boxing formed a new board in late 2013 following a sustained period of in-fighting among administrators, which caused the organisation to lose a significant chunk of funding from Sport England. Having reformed, it is obliged to implement international rules as decreed by Aiba or it risks fighters being barred from international competitions and even the Olympics.</p> \n<p>However, Rob McCracken has been the GB boxing performance director since 2009 and was the head of Britain’s team at London 2012. Throughout he has remained in the corner of Froch, the four-times super-middleweight world champion. Coaches cannot understand why it is permitted for an amateur official to be in a professional’s corner but not the other way around.</p> \n<p>Giorgio Brugnoli, an England Boxing director and secretary of Aiba’s technical rules commission, says Aiba want fighters to have a career through its own competitions. It has recently launched its own professional tournament called Aiba Pro Boxing, in addition to Aiba Open Boxing bouts and the World Series of Boxing that has run for five years.</p> \n<p>Brugnoli believes Aiba’s intentions are good but that the culture of professional boxing in England, run by the British Boxing Board of Control, means the regulations will always cause problems for coaches across the country.</p> \n<p>“Aiba want a kid who starts in AOB to continue right the way through and have a career in boxing through Aiba,” said Brugnoli. “But it’s not possible with the British Board of Boxing Control. In England budding potential professionals would go through the BBBC. In Asia, Africa and a lot of countries there is no professional boxing. We live in a different boxing culture to those who box in Nigeria, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan for example. I do empathise with the coaches, I think they have a very strong argument. Why should a coach who has had a kid since the age of nine, 10, 11, 12 be told you can’t go in the corner with them when they box just because they’re professional. It’s wrong. I’m hopeful the situation can change.”</p> \n<p>Daniel Geey, a sports lawyer at Fieldfisher, said: “Many individuals participating in amateur and professional boxing have been severely affected by the regulations the Aiba have put in place. No real rationale or justification has been given by Aiba as to why this artificial distinction is warranted or indeed necessary. Forcing coaches to choose between professional or amateur boxing is not acceptable. Unfortunately, Aiba has not substantively responded to our requests for rule clarification and we now must decide how best to take things forward.”</p> \n<p>Aiba has recently undergone a change in personnel at the top of the organisation which could have an impact on the regulations, with the French-Algerian Karim Bouzidi replacing the South Korean Ho Kim as the executive director, Kim having occupied the role for eight years.</p> \n<p>Aiba said in a statement: “As the global governing body, responsible for the safety of all of our athletes around the world, Aiba has established clear and comprehensive rules for coaches who wish to participate in any or all of the three Aiba programs (AOB, WSB and APB).</p> \n<p>“We have therefore organised and hosted special courses around the world for coaches to ensure that they can gain the Aiba certifications. However, in order to get the certifications, we urge coaches to only concentrate on Aiba programmes and coaching management by parting with their professional boxing involvement as they need to be in our system to focus on our boxers and should not cross over all the time.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434988868663/bd0f4426-e601-4375-bb77-1d1cd78fed03-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Justin Setterfield/Getty Images","altText":"Head guards hang from the ropes as boxers spar at Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in Lambeth, London.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Justin Setterfield/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T15:33:41Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T23:55:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":18,"contributors":[{"name":"James Riach","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/8/20/1408555677652/James-Riach-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/james-riach"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Boxing","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/boxing","webTitle":"Boxing"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"James Riach","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/james-riach"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/22/amateur-boxing-aiba-coaches-ruling","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a2n2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jun/22/amateur-boxing-aiba-coaches-ruling","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/22/amateur-boxing-aiba-coaches-ruling"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434988868663/bd0f4426-e601-4375-bb77-1d1cd78fed03-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Head guards hang from the ropes as boxers spar at Fitzroy Lodge Boxing Club in Lambeth, London.
