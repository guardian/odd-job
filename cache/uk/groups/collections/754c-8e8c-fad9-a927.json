Steven Gerrard’s emotional farewell to Anfield ended on the flattest of notes as Crystal Palace ruined his final outing on home soil and exposed Liverpool to the prospect of a worrying future without him. It was Norwich’s Jeremy Goss tripping up the Spion Kop’s last stand in 1994 all over again.</p> \n<p>Gerrard rallied late on as he tried to rescue Liverpool one last time but to no avail. The 34-year-old’s shots sailed high and wide, prompting mocking tribute from the Kop and a thumbs-up in return from their departing hero, whereas Jason Puncheon and the Palace substitutes Wilfried Zaha and Glenn Murray hit the target to remind all not only of their presence at Anfield but their stirring potential under Alan Pardew.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/16/painful-end-steven-gerrard-liverpool-crystal-palace-anfield\">Painful end for Steven Gerrard, Liverpool’s superman for all seasons | Daniel Taylor</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For the second time this season Palace had beaten Brendan Rodgers’ team 3-1, completing the club’s first league double over Liverpool, and in Yannick Bolasie they possessed the most formidable talent on the pitch.</p> \n<p>Rodgers complained legitimately over the visitors’ second and third goals – offside and a penalty for a foul outside the area – but the most accurate verdict on the day came from the Liverpool supporters themselves. The home crowd gave Bolasie a deserved standing ovation when he departed eight minutes from time. Later, when Gerrard was asked how bright the future looked for Liverpool next season, laughter rolled off the Kop.</p> \n<p>The Liverpool manager stood in the crowd with a face like thunder before embarking on a lap of honour where his players trailed far behind their captain, just as they had done Palace throughout the game.</p> \n<p>“We started reasonably well and scored a fantastic goal but we made poor defensive errors across the field and they punished us,” Rodgers said.</p> \n<p>“Their second goal was offside and their penalty was clearly outside the box but that doesn’t take away that we could have done much better in the defensive moments of the game.”</p> \n<p>Events before kick-off indicated Palace were not exactly at the forefront of Liverpool’s minds as Gerrard ended his warm-up by conducting a brief television interview in front of the Kop and both teams formed a guard of honour for the captain, appearing with his three young daughters in tow.</p> \n<p>The game itself, however, must have been a release to the 34-year-old and his team-mates after a week of intense scrutiny and Liverpool did start with some purpose. The ceremonious atmosphere was reflected in the sky above Anfield where a plane flew carrying a banner that read “In Rodgers We Trust”. Liverpool’s previous home game, of course, had witnessed a very different fly-over when the manager looked up at a banner that read “Rodgers Out Rafa In”. Anfield’s aerial tit-for-tat demonstrated one thing: some people have far too much time and money to waste.</p> \n<p>Liverpool were gifted the lead from one of their former players and one of their supporters in the heart of the visiting defence. Martin Kelly played Scott Dann into trouble with a careless pass behind his central defensive colleague and Adam Lallana took full advantage, pressuring Dann into a slip, racing through from deep and sweeping an excellent finish into the top corner of Wayne Hennessey’s goal, then seeking out Gerrard for the celebration of only his fifth goal of an injury-hit season.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/gallery/2015/may/16/anfield-says-goodbye-to-steven-gerrard-in-pictures\">Anfield says goodbye to Steven Gerrard – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Pardew and Palace responded impressively, the manager switching Bolasie into the attack and his team were instantly more threatening as a result. Joe Ledley, Bolasie, Puncheon and Lee Chung-yong all went close or squandered clear chances before the visitors scored a fine and merited equaliser. Emre Can, tormented by Bolasie all game, conceded a free-kick 20 yards from goal with a trip on the Congo international. Puncheon marked his new four-year contract at Selhurst Park by sweeping the set piece into the bottom corner.</p> \n<p>The men in yellow showed more urgency in the second half too and were incensed when the FA Cup final referee, Jon Moss, ignored two strong penalty appeals when Martin Skrtel handled Bolasie’s cross and then clipped Lee on the follow-up. Palace would not be denied. Zaha converted Bolasie’s inviting cross to the back post 22 seconds after his introduction, albeit from an offside position, and Lucas Leiva was wrongly adjudged to have fouled the former Manchester United player inside the area in the 90th minute. Simon Mignolet saved Murray’s spot-kick but the substitute scored on the rebound.</p> \n<p>“He showed where he is in his world today,” said Pardew of Bolasie. “He has fantastic power, pace and is a real dangerous threat. He has that scare factor but he needs to get that end product sorted out and he is 25, not 21.”</p> \n<p>For the 34-year-old about to set off on his last lap of Anfield, however, it was a deflating way to go.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431844057167/97a50b7b-955d-48cf-b294-b81bed79c3ab-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Tom Jenkins","altText":"Liverpool’s Steven Gerrard looks dejected in the final minutes of the match against Crystal Palace at Anfield.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Tom Jenkins"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-16T18:44:50Z","lastModified":"2015-05-17T06:27:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":849,"contributors":[{"name":"Andy Hunter","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/22/1400764274125/Andy-Hunter-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/andyhunter"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Premier League","Liverpool","Crystal Palace","Steven Gerrard","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/premierleague","webTitle":"Premier League"},{"id":"football/liverpool","webTitle":"Liverpool"},{"id":"football/crystalpalace","webTitle":"Crystal Palace"},{"id":"football/steven-gerrard","webTitle":"Steven Gerrard"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Andy Hunter","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/andyhunter"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"footballContent":{"id":"3736260","status":"FT","phase":"after","kickOff":"2015-05-16T16:30:00Z","competitionDisplayName":"Premier League","homeTeam":{"id":"9","name":"Liverpool","shortCode":"LIV","crestUri":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/sport/football/crests/9.png?width=#{width}","score":1,"scorers":[{"player":"Lallana","timeInMinutes":26}],"followUp":{"type":"list","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/liverpool"},"topic":{"displayName":"Liverpool","topic":{"type":"football-team","name":"9"}}},"awayTeam":{"id":"5","name":"C Palace","shortCode":"CRY","crestUri":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/sport/football/crests/5.png?width=#{width}","score":3,"scorers":[{"player":"Puncheon","timeInMinutes":43},{"player":"Zaha","timeInMinutes":60},{"player":"Murray","timeInMinutes":90,"additionalInfo":"+0:27"}],"followUp":{"type":"list","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/crystalpalace"},"topic":{"displayName":"C Palace","topic":{"type":"football-team","name":"5"}}},"matchInfoUri":"http://football.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/match-info/3736260","venue":"Anfield"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/16/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49xa2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/may/16/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/16/liverpool-crystal-palace-premier-league-match-report"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/17/1431844057167/97a50b7b-955d-48cf-b294-b81bed79c3ab-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Liverpool’s Steven Gerrard looks dejected in the final minutes of the match against Crystal Palace at Anfield.

insists only those candidates aligned with his stance towards Kevin Pietersen, with the batsman ruled out of this summer’s plans, will be considered.</p> \n<p>When asked on Tuesday at Lord’s whether English cricket’s relationship with the 34-year-old could ever be rebuilt, Strauss replied “absolutely” and claimed both parties “should look at ways and methods of trying to make that happen”. Those words felt optimistic at the time and since then the mud-slinging has continued, with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/15/colin-graves-england-kevin-pietersen-chairman-recall-ecb\">Colin Graves</a>, the new chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, the last to stick his head above the parapet.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/16/england-tough-time-new-zealand-kevin-pietersen-peter-moores-andrew-strauss\">England’s tough time could get trickier against strong New Zealand | Vic Marks</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While Graves can now reflect on his first day in the job on Friday that was spent <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/15/colin-graves-kevin-pietersen-england\">defending himself over accusations of deceit from Pietersen</a>, Strauss will step up the process to identify <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/may/09/andrew-strauss-peter-moores-ecb-revolving-door\">the right person to replace Peter Moores</a>. But be it the front-runner Jason Gillespie, Strauss’s former Middlesex team-mate Justin Langer or AN Other, they must agree on Pietersen.</p> \n<p>“Any coach who comes into the England environment will know the situation,” said Strauss. “And he also, if his philosophy is aligned with mine, will understand the importance of trust in a team environment and why we made the call we made [on Pietersen] – because trust doesn’t exist. So I would have thought he’d understand the situation and be willing to work on those terms.”</p> \n<p>This assertion came as the former Test captain and the chief executive at the ECB, Tom Harrison, when not repeating the words “trust” and “clarity”, were trying to provide some sort of tangible vision for how the national side will operate. Strauss has, after all, been hired not just to rebolt the door that had creaked open to Pietersen at the start of March following some loose talk from Graves. His true brief is to set a four-year plan in motion that will release England from the constipated cricket that turned their World Cup into a long walk off a short pier and has left the Test side seemingly only ever one defeat from requiring open-heart surgery, despite a results column that suggests it is in slightly ruder health.</p> \n<p>The early visit of New Zealand for two Tests and six limited-overs internationals, starting at Lord’s on Thursday, is timely. For it was their rocket-fuelled World Cup campaign under Brendon McCullum, when they finished runners-up to the co-hosts Australia, that perhaps best illustrated how a side can wins hearts and minds of its public by playing instinctive, attacking cricket.</p> \n<p>England, low on confidence and with a fanbase divided, could do with a spot of that. But of all the questions he fielded on Tuesday – and bear in mind there was a tidal wave on the thorny subject of Pietersen – the only query he claimed he was uncomfortable in answering was in regards to the style of play his sides will strive for. Aggressive cricket is not a switch that can be flicked, apparently. “Everyone wants people to go out there and take the game to the opposition, whack them for 500 in 30 overs and bowl them out for 10. That would be perfect but that’s not the reality,” he said. “The style of cricket comes with the level of confidence of the players, the ability to get on top of opposition and that is going to take time, it won’t come overnight. I can’t go into the dressing room next week and say ‘lads, you need to score five an over’ – that’s ridiculous.”</p> \n<p>Instilling such confidence, for Strauss, comes down to the team’s culture and identity. It is here where he intends to learn from other successful teams, with New Zealand’s most successful sporting export, the All Blacks, his favourite. While he wisely chose not to mention their famous “no dickheads” selection policy, the 38-year-old is taken by the mantra that their international rugby players must “leave the shirt in a better place”.</p> \n<p>“The All Blacks have a very strong team identity and that sort of philosophy is absolutely spot on,” said Strauss. “England cricketers have got to be unbelievably proud of pulling on that shirt and there has got to be a whole culture that is associated with it. It’s not just about putting it on and going out and playing cricket, there has got to be something much bigger than that.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/17/kevin-pietersen-cricket-batsman\">Kevin Pietersen: is this the end for cricket’s great maverick?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“That drives everything and it’s got to be policed and bought into by the players themselves. That’s the only way culture works properly. Part of my job is to look at other sports and work out what we can take from them.</p> \n<p>“To be doing everything through the prism of our experiences in cricket is the wrong way of looking at it.”</p> \n<p>While the creation of such a sporting culture will take time, Strauss knows he must move fast on the coach, with Michael Clarke’s Australia arriving at the end of next month for their defence of the Ashes. Having been Test captain for six months before England last reclaimed the urn in 2009, he is not in agreement with the pessimists. “There’s been a lot of people saying we don’t have a chance of winning this Ashes series – I don’t believe that for one moment,” he said. “I’m not holding my hands up and saying we will lose this Ashes series to Australia, I think we have got a good chance of winning it.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431779898702/Andrew-Strauss-England-di-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Andrew Strauss, England's director of cricket, intends to learn from other successful sporting teams about identity and spirit.

They have led the table for the whole season, but, in a virtual reserve side, their props were Alex Corbisiero and Salesi Ma’afu, who were very much first choice at the start of the campaign. It showed how the scrum has become an issue for the Saints to the point where it seems to be the greatest barrier between the club and a second successive Premiership title.</p> \n<p>They lost their two tight-head props to the sin-bin in two minutes in the third quarter and they also suffered in the set piece against Saturday’s play-off opponents, Saracens, when the sides met at Milton Keynes last month. That game turned when Corbisiero and Ma’afu were replaced and the loss of the latter at the end of the season has turned from a blow into a blessing.</p> \n<p>The play-off between Northampton and Saracens is a repeat of last season’s final, which Saints won in the final seconds of extra time, while the one that follows it has Leicester travelling to Bath, where they lost 45-0 in September. That was not quite their season’s nadir as they were to be thumped a few weeks later by a club nowhere near the top four, Gloucester, but they have fought their way back redoubtably; eight wins in their final nine Premiership matches being enough to pip Exeter and make Bath feel slightly twitchy.</p> \n<p>Victory against Leicester is never to be assumed and they were the only one of the play-off contenders who knew what they had to do on the final day of the regular season: win.</p> \n<p>Northampton’s decision to field virtually a reserve team – only Lee Dickson and Ma’afu had held down starting positions regularly this season – on a ground where they had not won in the league since 2007, suggested a routine home victory, but the rivalry runs deep.</p> \n<p>Northampton led at half-time, three penalties from James Wilson trumping one from Freddie Burns and a rolling maul try for Jordan Crane, but it was largely a tame encounter considering the fixture had produced nine yellow cards and two red in the past four league meetings between the sides, as well as a citing for gouging.</p> \n<p>A scuffle between Corbisiero and Crane was as hot as it got in the opening period, but within 12 minutes of the restart Northampton were down to 13 men and 10 points behind after conceding a number of scrum penalties near their own line. Ma’afu was responsible for three of them and was promptly replaced by Gareth Denman as the referee, Matthew Carley, checked to see where his yellow card was.</p> \n<p>Denman’s first task was to set himself at a defending five-metre scrum with Leicester continuing to opt for a set piece rather than three points. The scrum went down and Denman joined Ma’afu for 10 minutes’ reflection on technique, but perception is everything. Leicester’s front row had popped up out of a retreating scrum at the end of the first half but play carried on and at his first scrum, the home replacement Marcos Ayerza dropped his elbow to the floor only for Ma’afu to be penalised moments following the Saints being blown after their front row had stood up at a scrum.</p> \n<p>Leicester, who have struggled to take play to opponents all season, won the match in the 10 minutes when they enjoyed a two-man advantage. Burns kicked his second penalty as Ma’afu trudged off and the full-back, Niall Morris, broke Ahsee Tuala’s weak tackle to score near the corner, extend his side’s lead to 13 points and take the game beyond the Saints.</p> \n<p>Northampton did have the last word with Tom Stephenson’s try, but only after Tommy Bell had kicked a penalty one minute after replacing Burns, who left the field for treatment having injured his shoulder in a tackle.</p> \n<p>With Owen Williams out for the season, Leicester will be monitoring their outside-half closely in the next few days, even if he is yet to show the fluency and devil that made him a favourite at Gloucester. “Freddie will play,” said Leicester’s director of rugby, Richard Cockerill.</p> \n<p>“Never mind what Bath did to us in September, they know they will be in for a battle. We have a dressing room full of players with big-match experience and we are mentally fresh. We know we can go there and win.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/16/1431792942759/Leicester-Tigers-v-Northa-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Leicester crowd celebrate as Niall Morris breaks clear to score a try during the Premiership match between against Northampton.

Despite the &pound;50m loss of revenue from not being in the Champions League, the world record &pound;750m, 10-year kit deal with Adidas starts on 1 August, so money will not be hard to come by.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/16/manchester-united-paul-pogba-summer-spend-louis-van-gaal\">Manchester United hand another &pound;150m to Louis van Gaal for summer spree</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Van Gaal also wishes to strengthen by adding a central defender – Borussia Dortmund’s Mats Hummels is first-choice – and a striker, with Harry Kane of Tottenham Hotspur potentially on the radar. But given United already have the centre-backs Phil Jones, Marcos Rojo, Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling, plus Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie, James Wilson and Radamel Falcao in attack, Van Gaal’s prime concerns are to find an elite operator to run the midfield and to answer the question of who is to be the United No1.</p> \n<p>Van Gaal and his philosophy have had a year to bed in, the players deep into the manager’s strategy of “retraining their brains” and familiar with his penchant for formation tinkering. High-octane <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/15/manchester-united-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">victories over Spurs</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/22/liverpool-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">Liverpool in consecutive weeks in March</a> provide the blueprint of how the Van Gaal United should play. On-field matters are largely in place. What is required to return the club to the highest level is correct recruitment.</p> \n<p>The Dutchman’s preferred tactical shape is 4-3-3 and if Pogba can be landed he would go straight into the midfield trident. The value of a high-class midfielder to United is illustrated in how results dip when Michael Carrick is unavailable. This year he has featured in 18 Premier League matches and missed 18. With Carrick in the side United have won 13 times, a 72.2% success rate that has yielded an average of 2.3 points per outing. Without Carrick there have been seven victories, a fall-off that drops the win percentage to 38.9, at an average of 1.4 points per match. Carrick turns 34 in July and age is beginning to affect him, a factor Van Gaal recognised recently by hinting the 2015-16 campaign may be his last.</p> \n<p>Pogba is available and <em>The Observer </em>has learned Van Gaal is free to pursue his purchase despite Sir Alex Ferguson allowing the 22-year-old to leave for free in the summer of 2012. Arturo Vidal, Pogba’s team-mate, is another option who remains on Van Gaal’s radar from last summer, the Chilean impressing in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/13/real-madrid-juventus-champions-league-semi-final-match-report\">Juve’s Champions League semi-final, second leg 1-1 draw at Real Madrid </a>that took them to the final in Berlin. Van Gaal may also consider Borussia Dortmund’s Ilkay G&uuml;ndogan.</p> \n<p>In De Gea, Van Gaal has a goalkeeper who would grace any continental aristocrat and whose stellar rise continues. The Spaniard was the sole United player to be voted into the PFA Team of the Year, the reward for a near-perfect campaign during which he has claimed invaluable points for his club.</p> \n<p>Given De Gea’s deal expires next summer and he has still not signed a fresh one it would be surprising if he was still United’s keeper next season, especially as Real Madrid lurk. Van Gaal has said that the question of De Gea’s future is dragging, and the club are seeking a replacement.</p> \n<p>V&iacute;ctor Vald&eacute;s, signed in January on a free transfer, is yet to make his debut and given the particular challenge of being United’s No1, represents a gamble should the Spaniard get the job. As Ed Woodward, the United executive vice-chairman, has indicated, the next campaign is not one for gambles. The requirement of Van Gaal was laid out publicly on Thursday when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/14/manchester-united-challenge-all-fronts-ed-woodward\">Woodward said that United “expect to be challenging for trophies on all fronts.” </a>Tottenham’s Hugo Lloris is a candidate to replace De Gea should he leave, though United have yet to make an official enquiry about the Frenchman.</p> \n<p>This summer should be the club’s serenest since 2012. The trauma caused by Ferguson’s retirement the following May, compounded by David Moyes’s disastrous campaign, is finally subsiding under Van Gaal. The Dutchman’s prime task has been to ensure a return to the Champions League and barring a mathematical miracle he has achieved it with two matches remaining. United welcome Arsenal on Sunday buoyed by the prospect of again performing under the midweek continental lights.</p> \n<p>What Woodward desires is a return to the gilded Ferguson years when the great Scot never went more than a season without a trophy after claiming his first, the 1990 FA Cup. When the 2015-16 season starts, on 8 August, it will be three seasons since Ferguson claimed United’s last honour, their 20th championship.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/16/arsene-wenger-hunger-arsenal-success-diminishing\">Ars&egrave;ne Wenger’s hunger for Arsenal success shows no signs of diminishing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While Woodward states United should mount a four-pronged challenge to land the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup, he would settle for a serious title challenge and claiming a domestic trophy.</p> \n<p>This will be Woodward’s third summer in the transfer market and after the trials of the corresponding window two years ago under Moyes when only Marouane Fellaini arrived he now possesses the experience to operate slickly. Having the Van Gaal name to help entice targets is a boon, too. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/07/manchester-united-agree-fee-memphis-depay-psv-eindhoven\">The fleetness of the Memphis Depay deal</a> was possible due to the Dutchman’s direct intervention to head off Paris Saint-German, Van Gaal having mentored the winger into the Holland squad for World Cup finals in Brazil.</p> \n<p>Depay’s impending arrival suggests United will hardly care should the Gareth Bale will-he-won’t-he-stay saga result in the Welshman remaining in Spain. Bale has no wish to leave Real, though given the ongoing circus United will monitor his situation. But if Pogba is bought and De Gea stays then expect Van Gaal to be quietly ecstatic even if the Welshman does not arrive.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431710726984/Paul-Pogba-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Paul Pogba left Manchester United in 2012 for Juventus on a free transfer.

Should Europe retain the Solheim Cup in Germany during September, the first time such a feat would have been achieved on home soil and with Koch as the captain, her decision to study the methods of Paul McGinley may have proved crucial.</p> \n<p>“The European Tour asked if I wanted to go,” Koch recalls. “And it was great, to see the team room and Paul. The thing that struck me the most was that is it not that different. Of course it is bigger and they have a different budget but the things we do are similar; blue and yellow everywhere, we make the players feel special, treat them the best they can be treated so they feel great about being there.</p> \n<p>“I was able to speak to Paul, I went into the team room to see what they had done and I will see him again over dinner, to discuss more. He already said that he would give me his phone number for any questions I had, so that is great. I think we are quite similar in that we want to know as captains that we have done all that we can. If I prepare properly and take care of all the details that I think are important then come Monday after the Solheim Cup, I want the feeling that I did all that I could to make the players play their best.”</p> \n<p>The connection here is obvious. The Solheim Cup team, just like their male equivalent, are seeking to continue with a template of success rather than re-invent wheels. “Whenever we have had a question or a decision, if there was something that was done in 2011 or 2013, the answer is: ‘We should do that because it worked,’” Koch adds. “That is the general feeling: we are not going to change a lot of things that have worked. Why would we? You also want to put your style as captain into it, though.”</p> \n<p>The 44-year-old Swede instantly rejects the notion that previous victories bring automatic fear of failure. “I don’t see it that way,” she says. “I think it is the US team that has the pressure. They have lost two. They don’t want to lose three in a row.</p> \n<p>“I put pressure on myself to be a good captain, I want to do my best. I want to be as good in the role as I can be and make sure the players are comfortable. From that, from having a great week together, come the results and success.”</p> \n<p>Koch is engaging company, but, like McGinley, she is not a soft touch and is clear in her goals. Whereas, say, many in the upper echelons of female golf play down the significance of gender splits in the sport – or the Royal &amp; Ancient’s previously discriminatory membership policy – Koch takes an alternative view. She has even studied it closely through research work.</p> \n<p>“I think it is very relevant. I was a bit shocked when I learned of all the rules that still exist in the UK; how many clothing and time restrictions on women when they can play for example,” she says. “I think it needs to change a bit to make it more accessible and more fun.</p> \n<p>“Women have to feel as welcome as men to go and play golf. A lot of it is tradition, that it is a men’s sport, we have that a little bit in Sweden as well but I think we are ahead of the UK when it comes to women’s participation. By about 10-13% more women.”</p> \n<p>The role the Solheim Cup has in this is clear; women’s golf is afforded a platform that is not common. The same applies this week; Koch will be in attendance at the Turkish Airlines Ladies Open, which will take the novel but sensible approach of running from Sunday until Wednesday with a view to attracting audiences.</p> \n<p>“The Solheim Cup is a big deal for European golf and a big showcase event for women’s golf in general,” Koch acknowledges. “It is our chance to really be the ambassadors for our sport, to show how great our players are.</p> \n<p>“The role-model element of women’s golf has changed a lot over the past few years with Charley Hull being so young, Lydia Ko the No1 player in the world having just turned 18.”</p> \n<p>Thankfully for Koch, she will be able to call on Hull but will not need to worry about facing Ko on the basic grounds of nationality. Hull’s starring role as a Solheim Cup debutant in Colorado two years ago will not be readily forgotten by anyone who witnessed it.</p> \n<p>“Charley had only played a year [professionally] so there was no way of knowing how she would react to that pressure,” Koch explains. “We all knew she would be great for the team and she really was – she brought a fresh, young spirit and a lot of laughs to the team. It was so refreshing to have her there, with her attitude.</p> \n<p>“It is sometimes hard to change someone’s confidence but situations can do that quite easily. My job that week is to make sure the team is as confident as it can be but if you come into it, like I did as a player, having done brilliantly two years before then you feel like just by being there you are going to play well. I know some of the players feel like that. I’m pretty sure that’s how Charley is going to feel when she shows up because she only has good memories.”</p> \n<p>Koch’s are still to be forged.
