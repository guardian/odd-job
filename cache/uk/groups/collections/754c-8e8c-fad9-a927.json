Rodgers has been asked to give his findings at a meeting to be held after the final Premier League game of the season at Stoke City on Sunday. There is no suggestion the manager’s position is under immediate threat but the investigation into Liverpool’s season, plus the extent of it, underlines the owner’s dissatisfaction with what has unfolded. The discussion promises to be a gruelling experience for Rodgers and his back-room staff at the very least.</p> \n<p>Tom Werner, the Liverpool chairman, and John W Henry, the principal owner, accepted last summer that the &pound;75m sale of Luis Su&aacute;rez to Barcelona would have an impact on Rodgers’ team and their prospects of a second successive challenge for the Premier League title. They also appreciate the effect that Daniel Sturridge’s dreadful run of injuries has had on a side that scored 101 league goals last season but only 51 this term. However, having spent &pound;117m on nine players last summer, the Boston-based owners believed Liverpool were equipped to qualify for the Champions League once again.</p> \n<p>There is concern not only at the modest impact of the recruits but the miserable end to the season, which has yielded only eight points from the last 24 available and also included a lame FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/19/raheem-sterling-booed-liverpool-fans-club-awards-ceremony\">Raheem Sterling booed by Liverpool fans at club’s awards ceremony</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Liverpool could end the season in seventh place should they lose at the Britannia Stadium on Sunday and both Tottenham Hotspur and Southampton win their final games. The absence of Champions League football at Anfield next term – for the fifth time in the last six seasons – is also believed to be a factor in Sterling’s determination to leave the club this summer, an intention he and his representative, Aidy Ward, are expected to confirm on Friday when they meet Liverpool’s chief executive, Ian Ayre.<br /></p> \n<p>Sterling was booed by a section of the Liverpool support when he picked up the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/19/raheem-sterling-booed-liverpool-fans-club-awards-ceremony\">club’s young player of the year award</a> night on Tuesday. The 20-year-old attended the event at the city’s Echo Arena despite the latest controversy over his future with the first team squad, the Liverpool Ladies team, academy players and former players paying tribute to the outgoing captain, Steven Gerrard, along with paying customers.</p> \n<p>Sterling had postponed talks over his contract until the end of the season but the meeting was brought forward at the request of his representatives, increasing the belief at Liverpool that the England international will refuse to commit to a new deal and wishes to leave.</p> \n<p>Manchester City are monitoring developments, although Ward has claimed the latest furore over his client’s future has been exaggerated. “The story has been blown somewhat out of proportion,” said the agent in a statement. “Raheem and his representatives have a meeting scheduled with Liverpool later this week and we will take proceedings from there.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/19/raheem-sterling-liverpool-fenway-sports-group\">Raheem Sterling has exposed flaws in Liverpool’s desire to play fair</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nevertheless FSG is willing to take the same hard-line stance it adopted with Su&aacute;rez in 2013 should Sterling refuse to sign a contract extension and keep the winger on his current &pound;35,000-a-week deal. Sterling is under contract at Liverpool until 2017 and the club’s owners are prepared to retain the player on his existing terms until next summer – costing him more than &pound;3m in lost wages given his rejection of a &pound;100,000-a-week contract – should the impasse continue. It would take a vastly inflated offer to test FSG’s resolve.<br /></p> \n<p>The former Liverpool winger John Barnes has given a damning verdict on Sterling’s stand-off with the club, claiming he could become the next Scott Sinclair should he succeed in moving to Manchester City. “Raheem has great potential but Liverpool gave him an opportunity and he should stay,” said Barnes. “He has not achieved anything. He has not won anything. Does anyone believe that, if he goes to Manchester City, he will be the first name on the team-sheet or are they just signing him because they need English players?

It is about building solid foundations over months and years, backing shrewd selectorial hunches, identifying the best tactical approach and instilling collective confidence. The naming of England’s 50-man training squad for the 2015 Rugby World Cup on Wednesday is less about individual gain and more about setting a collective tone.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/19/steffon-armitage-to-miss-out-on-england-rugby-world-cup-training-squad\">Steffon Armitage to miss out on England’s Rugby World Cup training squad</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In his own mind Stuart Lancaster already knows the vast majority of those who will make his final 31-man posse to be confirmed in late August. What he wants to ensure over the summer months, when his players will be invited to sweat buckets for their art in Surrey and Colorado, is that no preparatory stone – or boulder – is left unturned. Identifying those with sufficient strength of character to cope with the colossal pressures ahead is absolutely key.</p> \n<p>For that reason there will be few rookies travelling to the Rockies. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/19/steffon-armitage-to-miss-out-on-england-rugby-world-cup-training-squad\" title=\"\">Once the decision was taken not to make an exception and select the Toulon-based Steffon Armitage</a>, a significant number of the other moving parts fell relatively easily into place. By extending the wider squad to 50 from the provisional 45, Lancaster has also opted to keep as many contenders sweet for as long as possible.</p> \n<p>In contrast, France have named a training squad of only 36, leaving rather less margin for error in the event of injuries. There will always be unscheduled hiccups – in 2011 Danny Care damaged his foot in the buildup and missed the tournament – and Lancaster has clearly taken the view he would prefer not to be calling reinforcements up from the beach. Strength in numbers suits the management as much as it does the fringe contenders.</p> \n<p>What is instructive, either way, is how few of Martin Johnson’s mature squad in New Zealand are likely to be involved this time. Only a third are set to feature again this autumn and some of the 2011 backline names – Shontayne Hape, Matt Banahan – make that tournament feel an awful long time ago. Instead there are likely to be only a handful of uncapped players in Lancaster’s 50, fewer still if Sam Burgess’s representative league history is taken into account.</p> \n<p>What unites the up-and-coming youthful element – Maro Itoje, Luke Cowan-Dickie, Henry Slade, Elliot Daly – is the same quality exuded by George Ford and Owen Farrell: on-field presence beyond their years. Not all of them will make the final 31-man cut this time but Itoje, who can play either back‑row or lock, and Cowan-Dickie will keep their seniors more than honest while Slade and Daly have the midfield class to make <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/15/manu-tuilagi-rugby-world-cup-assautling-police-officer-england\" title=\"\">Manu Tuilagi’s abrupt absence</a> less problematic.</p> \n<p>What England do with Burgess will be mighty interesting, particularly given his increasing preference for playing at flanker rather than centre. At the very least he possesses leadership quality and a winner’s mentality, a more attractive package for Lancaster at this precise moment than, say, Exeter’s impressively strong but raw Dave Ewers. On the flip side, Burgess has barely had a break since the start of last year and has not done a great deal so far to indicate that he is a born Test union midfielder.</p> \n<p>England still have until the end of August to make their minds up. Do they pick people on what they can do, or jettison them on the basis of what they cannot? On form or reputation? Bath’s director of rugby, Mike Ford, was fascinating on that subject this week, claiming England selected too negatively when he was involved with the national team. “I’ve been in selection meetings where people have said: ‘We can’t pick him, he can’t tackle.’ I’ve learned to say: ‘Let’s look at what he can do.’”</p> \n<p>Gloucester’s James Simpson‑Daniel was among those he cited and, barring a late reprieve, Christian Wade is in danger of suffering a similarly unfulfilled Test career. There is no more dangerous wing in half a yard of space out wide than Wade but Johnny May and Chris Ashton, motivated by being dropped from the national team, have both finished the season at a gallop.</p> \n<p>Leicester’s Ed Slater, unlike his club‑mate Tom Croft, has also made it back from a long-term knee injury in the nick of time and, like Itoje and Nick Easter, can offer the bonus of being able to play in the second and back rows. With Ben Morgan’s match fitness still uncertain following a broken leg, Easter will also consider he has everything to play for.</p> \n<p>The last two weekends of the Premiership season will also offer others the chance to update perceptions, including for Henry Thomas, who has played just 47 minutes of Premiership rugby for Bath since February. For Armitage, though, the dream is over; he will be pushing 34 by the time of the 2019 World Cup in Japan. For a player of his talent never to feature at a World Cup is a crying shame.</p> \n<h2><strong>Possible England 50-man training squad</strong></h2> \n<p><strong>Full-backs</strong> M Brown (Harlequins), A Goode (Saracens). <strong>Wings</strong> C Ashton (Saracens), J May (Gloucester), J Nowell (Exeter Chiefs), A Watson (Bath), M Yarde (Harlequins). <strong>Centres</strong> B Barritt (Saracens), S Burgess (Bath), L Burrell (Northampton), E Daly (Wasps), K Eastmond (Bath), J Joseph (Bath), H Slade (Exeter Chiefs), B Twelvetrees (Gloucester). <strong>Fly-halves</strong> D Cipriani (Sale Sharks), O Farrell (Saracens), G Ford (Bath), S Myler (Northampton). <strong>Scrum-halves</strong> D Care (Harlequins), L Dickson (Northampton), J Simpson (Wasps), R Wigglesworth (Saracens), B Youngs (Leicester). <strong>Hookers</strong> L Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs), D Hartley (Northampton), R Webber (Bath), T Youngs (Leicester). <strong>Props</strong> K Brookes (Newcastle), A Corbisiero (Northampton), D Cole (Leicester), J Marler (Harlequins), M Mullan (Wasps), M Vunipola (Saracens), D Wilson (Bath). <strong>Locks</strong> D Attwood (Bath), M Itoje (Saracens), G Kruis (Saracens), C Lawes (Northampton), J Launchbury (Wasps), G Parling (Leicester). <strong>Flankers</strong> C Clark (Northampton), J Haskell (Wasps), M Kvesic (Gloucester), C Robshaw (Harlequins), E Slater (Leicester), T Wood (Northampton). <strong>No8s</strong> N Easter (Harlequins), B Morgan (Gloucester), B Vunipola (Saracens).</p> \n<h2>ALLEZ CLIVE?</h2> \n<p>When I mentioned in these columns last month that Sir Clive Woodward’s name had been linked to the vacant French coaching job, I suggested it was about as likely to become reality as Nigel Farage becoming French president. Since then Woodward has made the final shortlist of eight and is now being quoted as 10-1 fourth favourite by some bookmakers. Should the firm favourite Guy Nov&egrave;s lose out to England’s 2003 World Cup-winning coach, it will require an England comeback by Kevin Pietersen to oust it as the year’s most unlikely sporting new story.</p> \n<h2>ONE TO WATCH...</h2> \n<p>Bath v Leicester. When the Tigers lost 45-0 at the Recreation Ground in September it suggested the rivalry between two of England’s most successful clubs was entering a new phase. This weekend they will be reunited in a Premiership semi-final at the same venue. If Leicester win it will be one of the more striking achievements of Richard Cockerill’s eventful tenure.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432043951846/Stuart-Lancaster-will-tes-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stuart Lancaster will test his extended England squad in Surrey and Colorado this summer.

With the pitch displaying a green tinge two days before the first ball is sent down, fast bowlers are once again expected to prosper.</p> \n<p>Two of their breed were paraded in front of the media on Tuesday. While one of them can reflect on 10 wickets in his last outing at the ground, the other has never played a competitive match there and is yet to experience the effects of the ground’s famous slope. It is something of a curiosity that the second of those is the Englishman.</p> \n<p>Mark Wood is the uncapped quickie in question and, after a month of carrying the drinks in the Caribbean, the 25-year-old is hoping raw skills trump a lack of familiarity with the home of cricket and that he is granted a Test debut by the captain, Alastair Cook, and the caretaker coach, Paul Farbrace.</p> \n<p>“I haven’t played here before for Durham or anything so I’m really excited,” said Wood, who made his ODI bow in Dublin. “The whole feel of the place is not something I can explain to anyone. I’ve been here twice as 12th man and as you all know, I’m used to running drinks. Hopefully this time I’m here to play. Third time lucky!”</p> \n<p>Does the famous Lord’s slope hold any fears for a bowler with only 24 first‑class appearances under his belt? “The stumps don’t move,” Wood replied, with a smile. “I’m going to run in, try to bowl with good pace and see if I can knock the Kiwis over.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"779938998badd123a67aa79923bbc67c367e5646\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/779938998badd123a67aa79923bbc67c367e5646/496_210_2488_1493/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southee\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tim Southee said the famous Lord’s slope can take time to get used to for some bowlers</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Cooper/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is certainly something his counterpart Tim Southee struggled to adapt to when, on his first Lord’s appearance in 2008 as a 19-year-old, he went wicketless. Five years later, however, the right-armer overcame those issues to claim match figures of 10-108, albeit in a 170-run defeat.</p> \n<p>“The slope is different to anywhere else in the world – that’s the biggest thing,” said Southee, who arrived on Sunday after a spell playing for Mumbai in the Indian Premier League. “The nets out the back are no different to any other nets but then you come out in the middle and you have to react to the slope. Different people take longer, some adapt straight away.”</p> \n<p>Should they select Wood, England will hope he fits the latter description. In an era of media-coached professional sportsmen, he is certainly a breath of fresh air. When asked why his county have produced fast bowlers such as himself, Steve Harmison and Graham Onions, he replied: “Because we’re used to hard work up there, working-class people and that.”</p> \n<p>It appears England have found the natural successor to the now retired Graeme Swann as the joker in the pack. Just ask Christine Ohuruogu, who was on the receiving end of his penchant for a prank when the athlete was staying in the same hotel as England’s fast bowlers during their training camp in Potchefstroom, South Africa, last November.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-uLmSt-gro\" title=\"\">video that has since circulated online</a>, the Olympic gold medallist answered her bedroom door to discover a seemingly empty wheelie bin, only for Wood to burst out and put the frighteners up her. Drunken japes on tour? Not so, with Wood a teetotaller and just naturally up for a laugh.</p> \n<p>Caps are not handed out for humour, however, and it is Wood’s skiddy pace, generated from a short approach to the crease and a whippy action, that has led to him being retained from the Caribbean tour. Among his many idiosyncrasies – <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/mar/25/mark-wood-england-cricket-caribbean-durham-sussex-abu-dhabi\" title=\"\">he spoke to the Guardian in March about his imaginary horse</a> – is a quirky run-up, which he starts from a lunging position.</p> \n<p>“It’s almost like a sprinter’s start – a little step back then quickly into my run-up before my gather,” said Wood. “It’s something I did probably when I was about 18-19, I used to have a really long run-up, and the academy coach John Windows at Durham wanted me to change my run-up slightly to be a bit more efficient and explosive. It’s worked well for me since then so I’m going to keep doing it.”</p> \n<p>If selected, Wood faces a New Zealand side fresh from a thrilling World Cup campaign under their captain, Brendon McCullum, in which their players walked out on to the pitch exhibiting the confidence of Tony Montana in the final scene of the film Scarface. Not that Wood is intimidated by batsmen who come after him.</p> \n<p>“You’ve got to be right on the money and concentrate really hard on what you’re doing. If you can settle into that rhythm, everything almost flows, it’s dead easy,” he said. “If a batsman wants to come hard at you and you bowl him good balls then you can get him out. If Plan A isn’t working I’ve almost always got a back-up plan I can pull out of the locker.”</p> \n<p>If Wood gets the nod at St John’s Wood for the third seamer’s berth on Thursday, England will find out if that is the case and New Zealand, like Ohuruogu, could be in for a surprise.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/19/1432058201892/Mark-Wood-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mark Wood says his unorthodox lunging start to his run-up helps him 'be a bit more efficient and explosive'.

That means 1, 4, 7, 13 is the same as 13, 4, 1, 7.</li> \n <li>Prior to the lottery, each team is assigned a predetermined amount of four-number combinations based on their order of finish during the regular season.</li> \n <li>Since the Minnesota Timberwolves ended the season with the NBA’s worst record, they will get 250 of the 1,001 combinations available – giving them a 25% chance at the No1 overall pick. The team with the best record, the Oklahoma City Thunder, have only five combinations (0.5%).</li> \n <li>Only the top three picks are selected through the lottery. The remaining slots are determined by reverse order of finish. That means the Timberwolves can receive no worse than the No4 pick.</li> \n</ul> \n<p>While the results will be nationally televised on ESPN, the lottery itself took place roughly an hour ago in a conference room below the lobby of the Hilton. The New York Times had a well-reported story yesterday about the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/18/sports/basketball/before-envelopes-are-opened-draft-fates-are-sealed-in-secrecy.html\">security measures taken by the NBA</a> to keep the results embargoed.</p> \n<p>ESPN’s pre-show starts at 8pm ET with the lottery itself scheduled to begin at 8.30.

In G&ouml;tzis she will not be gunning for victory, or even a podium position, against a stacked field but to score the 6,200 points required to make the qualifying standard for next year’s Rio Olympics. As her coach, Toni Minichiello, who professes himself very pleased with her comeback since <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/jul/18/jessica-ennis-hill-birth-baby-boy-reggie\" title=\"\">the birth of her child, Reggie, last year</a>, admits: “We wouldn’t be going there if we didn’t think we had a realistic shot of getting it.”</p> \n<p>The decision to compete in Austria was taken after a short discussion between the pair on Monday. Minichiello asked how her achilles, which have niggled and hampered her in recent weeks, were feeling after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/16/jessica-ennis-hill-continues-comeback-loughborough\" title=\"\">competing in the long jump and javelin at the Loughborough International meeting on Sunday</a>. Ennis‑Hill told him she felt fine. Minichiello then ran it past the medical team and sports scientists at the English Institute of Sport, who also gave their blessing. After a series of baby steps, Ennis-Hill had taken a giant leap forward on the comeback trail.</p> \n<p>She clearly cannot wait to throw herself back in at the deep end. “The results I have had at the competitions over the past few weeks are promising and we believe it is feasible for me to do a full heptathlon and achieve the level of points I need to qualify for Rio,” Ennis-Hill says. “If I can achieve this early in the season it removes a real pressure and all the indicators are looking positive, so I plan to go to G&ouml;tzis and give it my best shot.”</p> \n<p>There is bound to be a stumble or two on the way. Minichiello admits that her high jump “will be interesting” given that she has hardly practised it this year because of how “destructive” it can be on the body.</p> \n<p>However, the pair are hoping that a strong field in G&ouml;tzis – which includes the Commonwealth champion, Brianne Theisen-Eaton, the world bronze medallist Dafne Schippers, the two‑times European champion Antoinette Nana Djimou and Briton’s world junior champion, Morgan Lake – will turbo-boost Ennis-Hill’s competitive juices and thereby her points tally.</p> \n<p>There are reasons for optimism. Her <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/may/10/jessica-ennis-hill-athletics-heptathlon-gotzis-toni-minichiello\" title=\"\">hurdles time of 13.14sec in the Manchester CityGames this month</a> would score 1,103 in the heptathlon, while her long jump of 6.16m and javelin of 43.88m in Loughborough would be worth 899 and 742 points respectively. That would be a combined tally of 2,744 points from three events – leaving her needing 3,456 from the other four events she tackles in G&ouml;tzis.</p> \n<p>As Minichiello rightly points out, it is hard to judge those comeback performances in isolation because the demands of seven events over two days are so different.</p> \n<p>“The hurdles is the one that is really comparable because you rock up to that one fresh,” he says. “But then there is a fatigue factor. Can you produce that long jump on day two having done four events on day one? Can you improve on&nbsp;the javelin? And can you top it off with an 800m?”</p> \n<p>However, Minichiello, an arch realist as well as a deeper thinker, admits he is very pleased with what Ennis-Hill has already achieved since her comeback. “What I have never explained very well is how hard it is to return after having a baby,” he says. “Jess returned to training in November but she had to take such a limited approach. She couldn’t lift heavy weights because the abdominals were not fully knitted together after her pregnancy. She couldn’t do any twisting and turning and we had to wait three months before she could lift over her head.</p> \n<p>“The other difficulty is that her body is more flexible than it was before,” he added. “In same cases that is a good thing but the lack of tendon tension is a bad one because she hasn’t yet got the jump speed that she had before. We have also had to tinker, to adapt and sometimes to back off because of soreness.”</p> \n<p>On the back of such challenges, Minichiello agrees that the early stages of Ennis‑Hill’s comeback have been more impressive than many have given her credit for. “If you look at her physical shape it’s great,” he says. “People talk about distance runners returning quickly from pregnancy but they can instantly run and jog. They don’t need to propel an object from above their head. Or lift heavy weights. It took Jess six, seven or even eight months after giving birth to her son before she could do some things.</p> \n<p>“Given all that, I am really pleased with the way she is returning and I am feeling quite positive about her being in a position to achieve the qualification for the Olympics.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/5/19/1432055782368/Jessica-Ennis-Hill-contin-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jessica Ennis-Hill continued her comeback at the Loughborough International meeting at the weekend.
