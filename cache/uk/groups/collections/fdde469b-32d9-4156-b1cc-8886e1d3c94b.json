But this week the TV cook and food campaigner is to expand his commercial empire into the heart of unpretentious cuisine: the family home.</p> \n<p>After a faltering start, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/JamieOliver\" title=\"\">Oliver’s two popular YouTube channels, Food Tube and Drinks Tube</a>, are to be joined on Tuesday by a third, Family Food Tube. Appearing alongside his wife, Jools, and their four children, Oliver will be introducing a few other specially chosen family-friendly presenters and guest chefs, demonstrating that he is convinced that on-demand internet films are the best way to reach and teach his public.</p> \n<p>Speaking to the <em>Observer</em>, the chef said: “The thing I love about the YouTube channels is that they allow a more or less direct connection to the audience, so you can work out what they’re passionate about much more quickly.</p> \n<p>“Take <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9r-CxnCXkg\" title=\"\">the video we put up for scrambled eggs three-ways</a>. It’s had almost two million views and created a huge amount of discussion, because people want to share the video with their friends and also share their own ways of making it.”</p> \n<p>Oliver’s existing food channel, which was relaunched in 2013 after a major rethink of its content, now has 2.6 million subscribers. Drinks Tube was launched in its wake last year and within months the app version was topping the profitability charts on UK iTunes.</p> \n<p>The decision of a company that makes some &pound;10m profit a year to pour more time and money into YouTube is a symptom of the growing emphasis on this sort of broadcasting, particularly for food-related programming. Michelin-starred chef Gordon Ramsay was in the vanguard and retaining a big audience. Delia Smith followed, claiming that, although she could have continued to work in television, she did not like the pressure to entertain and preferred to just communicate her techniques.</p> \n<p>Oliver, motivated by the same yearning for a direct relationship with his audience and consumers, said he has now identified the family as the centre of demand for easy-access recipes.</p> \n<p>“With Family Food Tube, we’re making video content for parents by parents, which is exactly what the public have asked for. Everyone appearing on the channel is a parent, including my missus, so they know what they’re talking about, but we’re not preaching at all.”</p> \n<p>The channel, he claims, will just be “giving a helping hand”. It will be, he promises, a place to get “no-nonsense, practical advice”.</p> \n<p>It is also, of course, the way to ensure that the Jamie Oliver brand stays in contact with consumers and in touch with changing food trends. It is a commercially astute way to promote his books and television shows, as well as his national food campaigns.</p> \n<p>“Jamie is obviously backing YouTube channel as the communication platform of the future,” said broadcaster and <em>Observer</em> food critic Jay Rayner. “Has he found a way to make it pay already with advertising and sponsorship? Or is it a way of ensuring he stays ahead of changing television audience habits?”</p> \n<p>Food Tube is among the handful of top international food channels, which is quite something when you remember that food is the second most sought-after topic on the internet after sex.</p> \n<p>His digital platform already claims to reach 30 million global viewers a month and he also has an advertising venture, Fat Lemon. Some of the most downloaded content is already advertising and Drinks Tube is supported by a three-year sponsorship deal with rum manufacturer Bacardi.</p> \n<p>Oliver argues that his YouTube presence is the perfect way for him to develop new broadcasting talents – something that networked television channels were wary of letting him do.</p> \n<p>Some of the cooks who have made their name on his existing channels, such as his <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/kerryanndunlop\" title=\"\">protege, Kerryann Dunlop, </a>already have their own spin-off channels and operate like kitchen DJs, listing their favourite food videos and posting clips of bloopers and out-takes.</p> \n<p>The new family channel is more likely to build on the popular “vlogged” video footage from his own kitchen table and featured in the Food Tube segment known as “What’s Jamie Eating Today?” The use of the Oliver children in this wider context is a bold move for a protective father. Two years ago he was reported to have banned his eldest daughter from Facebook.</p> \n<p>The key to a YouTube hit is a personal, informal tone, and food channels such as Vegan Black Metal Chef, Hungry YouTube and SortedFood have perfected the haphazard look. TV executives are leaving networked food shows to learn these techniques; online news services Buzzfeed and Vice have also joined the food business recently. Oliver clearly believes there is still a gap for family-oriented information – to be updated with new content every Wednesday.</p> \n<p>“Everything has gone through my nutrition team, so the recipes are going to all be full of good ingredients,” he says</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432327153184/jamie-oliver-youtube-laun-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jools and Jamie Oliver at a special screening at Bafta Photograph: David Benett/Getty Images","credit":"David Benett/Getty Images","altText":"jamie oliver youtube launch","cleanCaption":"Jools and Jamie Oliver at a special screening at Bafta Photograph: David Benett/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-23T23:07:08Z","lastModified":"2015-05-23T23:07:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":59,"contributors":[{"name":"Vanessa Thorpe","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vanessathorpe"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Jamie Oliver","UK news","YouTube","Food TV"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/oliver","webTitle":"Jamie Oliver"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"technology/youtube","webTitle":"YouTube"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/food-tv","webTitle":"Food TV"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Vanessa Thorpe","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/vanessathorpe"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/24/jamie-oliver-youtube-launch","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/496n6","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/24/jamie-oliver-youtube-launch","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/24/jamie-oliver-youtube-launch"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432327153184/jamie-oliver-youtube-laun-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jools and Jamie Oliver at a special screening at Bafta Photograph: David Benett/Getty Images","credit":"David Benett/Getty Images","altText":"jamie oliver youtube launch","cleanCaption":"Jools and Jamie Oliver at a special screening at Bafta Photograph: David Benett/Getty Images"}},"importance":7,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432327153184/jamie-oliver-youtube-laun-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jools and Jamie Oliver at a special screening at Bafta Photograph: David Benett/Getty Images","credit":"David Benett/Getty Images","altText":"jamie oliver youtube launch","cleanCaption":"Jools and Jamie Oliver at a special screening at Bafta Photograph: David Benett/Getty Images"}}]},{"title":"Celebrity MasterChef 2015: the contestants revealed","rawTitle":"Celebrity MasterChef 2015: the contestants revealed","item":{"type":"article","id":"tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/may/14/celebrity-masterchef-2015-the-contestants-revealed","title":"Celebrity MasterChef 2015: the contestants revealed","trailText":"Who’ll be wearing the aprons in TV’s toughest celebrity cooking test?

Probably the end of known existence. There’s always been one. Even in the background of Da Vinci’s Last Supper, you can just about make out a team of aspiring chefs talking about how hard it was to put a unique twist on “bread for 13”.</p> \n<p>There are so many culinary shows, jumping between channels makes me feel like a rather mundane superpower whose only skill is switching the identity of the chef that’s currently waxing lyrical about local produce. I now refer to my remote as The Chef Changer.</p> \n<p>Sating our need for pornographic close-ups of souffl&eacute; – and unnervingly clear audio of critics wetly chewing their food – is <a href=\"http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/masterchef/episodes http://tenplay.com.au/channel-ten/masterchef/season-7/episode-6\">MasterChef</a> (Channel Ten), returning for its seventh season in Australia. Of all the shows that take “stuff on plates” as their premise, it’s probably my favourite. There’s less focus on building up unnecessary, and false, character rivalries to generate drama, leaving more time to focus on the cooking.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, we don’t have to sit through footage of the contestants going shopping either (something which often made My Kitchen Rules seem like little more than choppy CCTV footage of Coles). MasterChef has its own supermarket in the studio, which the cooks hurtle towards in a high quality grabbing-frenzy. A note here: chefs make particularly fussy looters, so don’t pal up with them in a zombie apocalypse; there’s no time to look for shards of saffron, just grab the nearest tin of mushy peas!</p> \n<p>Sunday’s episode featured the Mystery Box round, a feature made mysterious by the box rather than its contents, unless you consider a crab and a coconut mysterious (I suppose they would be if you found them on adjacent seats on a bus). As far as cooking shows go, it’s a good segment, allowing us to see the generation of 20 different dishes, most of them pretty impressive and none particularly predictable. I could only think of putting the crab in the coconut, thereby creating the world’s most horrifying Kinder Surprise.</p> \n<p>After the Mystery Box was the Invention Test, which is sort of the same thing, to be honest, except that the key ingredient is revealed from under a cloche instead of a wooden box. Again, the end results were fascinating, but by this time I think I’d had enough of the TV competition tropes of ticking clock, mid-cook interviews with the chefs sure they weren’t going to make it, and the three judges pottering around muttering: “You’re not making that are you? Ooh, I wouldn’t do that.”</p> \n<p>Okay, so the moments of judgement can be slightly grating. First, there’s that moist, masticating soundscape as the three critics gurn, grunt and slaver their way through the dish, accompanied by the metallic chimes of cutlery repeatedly clinking against plates. It sounds like a wildlife documentary of some starved lions gorging on the cast of Stomp. </p> \n<p>There’s also George Calombaris’ slightly intense handshakes, reminiscent of the sort of fatalistic bonding sessions that occur between two soldiers before they go over the top. I’m convinced there’s something else going on as he grips the contestant’s hand: a mind meld perhaps, or the communication of his entire life story through his fiercely staring eyes. Bits of fat to be trimmed, then, but MasterChef is still far more rewarding than most of the alternatives.</p> \n<h2>And the award for worst promo goes to ...</h2> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456613170__\n</div> \n<p>What were the marketing team behind <a href=\"http://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/433209411782/struggle-street-s1-ep1\">Struggle Street</a> (SBS) thinking? Having seen <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/may/06/struggle-street-review-must-see-tv-undersold-by-sensationalism\">the first episode</a>, I’m reassured this show might actually be a sympathetic and eye-opening glimpse into the lives of the disadvantaged (yes, even worse off than those on <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/really-mr-abbott-185k-not-especially-high-20150510-ggyeuh.html\">the rather low income of $185,000 a year, Mr Abbott</a>). Why then set the show up as if it were meant to appeal to viewers who want to do nothing more than have a good scoff at those less fortunate?</p> \n<p>Ashley, for example, comes across as a loving father in the first episode, albeit one who struggles due to his various health concerns. But sure, plop him in the promo having a good fart. Guess what: everyone farts.

Until series two (already commissioned). The last episode of Poldark (Sunday, BBC1) and the last opportunity to understand the subplot involving angry pseudo-aristo types, copper and smelting works. But what’s this? The Putrid Throat. “I would not wish the Putrid Throat on my last enemy,” said the Captain. At least aunt Agatha (Poldark’s answer to Downton’s Cousin Violet) is not at risk. “Ninety-three and the appetite of a girl of 20,” she announced, whilst snaffling her nephew’s supper. This was not a cheery episode. Please not Demelza! The Twin Peaks hallucinogenic bit was a bit weird. And then the worst: a dead baby. “Everything I touch is cursed,” said Poldark, overwhelmed by the attendance at his daughter’s funeral. But what’s this? A shipwreck. Bringing pilchards for all. Or not quite all. “T’ain’t right. T’ain’t fair. T’ain’t proper. T’is our beach.” But what’s this? Off to jail! Huge emotions, lots of excellent acting, probably a bit too much flashing between different plotlines. True of this episode. And true of the whole series. Adieu, Captain. See some glimpses of your chest again soon.</p> \n<h2>Sous-vide operation is a basic skill nowadays</h2> \n<p>I wept throughout most of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/apr/24/simon-wood-masterchef-winner-2015-bbc\">the MasterChef final</a> (Friday, BBC1) following the “this is my journey” Pop-Idol-circa-2001 video segments at the beginning. Simon and Emma both have four children! Simon is a single dad! Emma also runs a successful luxury travel business! Tony wears a bow tie when he goes to the butcher! And he loves to sew on his sewing machine! There was an undeniable foreshadowing with Simon’s newspaper cutting from his childhood: he won a competition once. Surely he will win again? And, of course, he did. Simon is symbolic of everything that is good and bad about this series. He’s a genius chef, learns quickly from his mistakes and is generally an excellent role model. On the other hand, though, his perfection has been maybe a bit, er, boring. This combined with the ridiculous standard now expected has elevated this show into something that might be more at home on a foodie channel. I’m sure you didn’t need to know about sous-vide to compete before. How many “amateur cooks” have got one of those at home? Or maybe I’m behind the times, seeing as you can buy a sous-vide starter kit for around &pound;100. I will continue to make toast.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59b8cd2a3a311f11ff4ecfe97dd5f1a71df6937e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430122272404/81e494ba-d555-4a82-ad10-d718aee991dd-460x390.jpeg\" alt=\"Simon Wood, this year's Masterchef winner.\" width=\"460\" height=\"390\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simon Wood, this year’s MasterChef winner.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shine TV/BBC/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>When sitcom characters cut their hair, it’s the beginning of the end</h2> \n<p>We’re now on series eight of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/the-big-bang-theory\">The Big Bang Theory</a> (Sunday, E4) and apparently Penny has had short hair for some time. Not sure why I didn’t notice until now. But it has pointed up some shortcomings in what is otherwise a brilliant series, possibly better than <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/friends\">Friends</a> ever was. The characters are drawn in broad brushstrokes: a bunch of nerds and their geeky girl-next-door girlfriends. After such a long and successful run you can sense the actors straining at the seams of their characters. This is a problem when series 10 has just been commissioned, scheduled for 2016. I think Penny’s haircut was a protest. Friends lasted 10 seasons. The 21st century equivalent deserves to go out with a bang not a whimper. Maybe time to do a Penny and cut it short?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c9375b732e8492817e95497ad4c259e8a0a5a77b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430130886850/0e75f063-69ac-43e1-9798-f8088df09b86-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Penny with her new short hairstyle on The Big Bang Theory.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penny with her new short hairstyle on The Big Bang Theory.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Warner Bros/Warner Bros</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>A hair in a bed is unacceptable. Especially pubic.</h2> \n<p>I love Three in a Bed (Sunday, Channel 4). B&amp;B owners stay in each other’s properties and say how much they would pay to stay there if they were punters. The moment when they open the envelope containing the money – and carefully count it out – is priceless. Here’s 81-year-old Irene running The Don in Snowdonia’s historic mining town Blaenau Ffestiniog, recently awarded three stars by Visit Wales. She’s going to make it a successful business if it kills her. Meanwhile, online sweethearts Cath and Dave think they are running Blackpool’s classiest B&amp;B. On the Scottish borders Michael and Jane designed their own house: “Our breakfasts are second to none.” A hair on the bed? Not acceptable. “Not pubic hair. It’s impossible,” responded Irene. In Blackpool, everyone complained about the (lack of) views. “Well, at least we’ve got beautiful decor indoors.” In Scotland: “This isn’t a B&amp;B. It’s someone’s house.” And there’s another hair! With snobbery, Schadenfreude and judgement all round, this is the most quintessentially British programme on telly. Even more so than Come Dine With Me.

But he has, in this crammed hour, not only to re-thumbnail the personalities with a wizard’s thumb but get the timing beyond reproach. To this end, the entire cast are apparently “invited” to spend up to seven hours rehearsing 10 seconds of rapid-fire dialogue. I’m sure the above four could improvise delightfully – been lucky enough to meet two of them, one over drinks after a funeral, another over an extremely fun lunch, and what different people they <em>are</em>, thus what fine actors – but the Morton gene calls for just-so, and the BBC, bravely risking much to rip the ferret out of itself in this wince-out-loud comedy, acceded, in what may well become its finest confection since <em>Fawlty Towers</em>.</p> \n<p>Thus, for instance, the five just-so bollards. In more minor hands, the sequence in which the black Range Rover of HRH, an (unseen) Charles, is stymied at the entrance to New Broadcasting House, inside which the welcoming committee have become hogtied by their own insane security protocols, could have been simple farce. The anti-terrorist bollards would just have jumped up and down or spiked Charlie’s RR in the sump. Instead, Dave (Andrew Brooke), head of Beeb security, aided only by a ridiculous smartphone and the meaningless catchphrase “we are status-active”, manages with a stoic glower to “relent” bollards 2 and 4. And then, in quiet desperation, Nos 1, 3 and 5. There is a full nine-second pause. All bollards down. Then bollard 3 reappears, like a giant erection (as if there’s any other kind).</p> \n<p>There is glorious timing here, yes, but there’s also humanity. Was I alone in quietly cheering whip-smart Lucy (Sosanya) in being the first to make it to the royal meet-and-greet, having left the three witches trapped in their own personalities and also a non-revolving revolving door? Or in feeling, admittedly slightly, a twitch sorry for Will, the good-looking, charming intern with the kind of shoe-size IQ even a mother would struggle to love? If you didn’t see it, I just feel for you.

Again served by a great ensemble, it was hampered only by being so close not only to topicality but to truth. Stronger, Fairer, Nicer is the slogan on the Lib-Dem battle bus and a blistering <a href=\"https://twitter.com/actualbenmiller\">Ben Miller</a> couldn’t better negate any of those adjectives. The Tory bus has Hugh Dennis as the head of something involving “delivery”, although you were invited to set your watches back to 1954 as a bereft “women’s spokesman” had to crane her neck against the bus-rack just to be heard past his dullard alpha shoulders. Labour? Just constantly worried about the reaction on the doorstep to happy warrior Miliband. Andy Nyman’s Ukip press officer is not so much fighting Twitter storms – most of them engendered by the bus’s other occupants – as engaged in a Sisyphean bout of Whack-a-Mole. If only politics could be this much fun. If only Labour hadn’t sold everyone down the river. Adapted to the paradigm contiguities of a modern vibrant age. Sold everyone down the river.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"094a9683253eba32942bfbc9a72796ee07a8c998\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/23/1429791002834/56cbc8bb-2146-4d5d-9c17-760db95fbfa1-460x285.jpeg\" alt=\"safe house review\" width=\"460\" height=\"285\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Home security: Marsha Thomason, Christopher Eccleston and Paterson Joseph in Safe House.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>People have said many very good things about <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/drama/safe-house\"><strong>Safe House</strong></a>, but I’m yet to be convinced. It was dark – seriously dark in tone, but also there was much heavy shoe polish on all lenses. And it had Chris Eccleston. And I’m normally greatly in favour of… much of that… but there were enough plot holes for a battle bus to drive through, even one driven by Farage after 15 swifties. Why on earth was the daughter – locked away to protect her from a rampaging killer – allowed to keep her mobile phone (she was, see later in the episode, and if there’s one thing we know about teenage girls it’s that they <em>never</em> engage in social media and lead a killer to their safe house)? Why would ex-cop Eccleston, now cosy among the Cumbrian stone, choose to become haunted by a benign mistake reworked as a lazy plot twist, <em>and</em> fail to report a tail? His “You’re completely safe. No one knows you’re here” already rings as empty as “Trust me, I’m a lawyer” or “Fair deals for hard-working families”.</p> \n<p>Finals week on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006t1k5\"><strong>MasterChef</strong></a> and, as pretty much expected, Tony of the looby-loo moustaches and Simon of the two goody shoes are through, accompanied a little surprisingly by Emma of the overwhelming spices. It’s been fun, this series, with the contestants encouraged to chat away and dig into their respective dishes, and anything that reduces <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GreggAWallace\">Egg Wallace</a>’s on-screen babble is perforce a good thing. They went to Sweden last week to tackle a couple of frankly lunatic restaurants, including one rooted in a stone age ethos, which must have had Isis salivating. But the closer the finals loom, the more one feels heartsick sorry for the final fallers: even the runner-up is almost bound to land a cookbook deal. I’d certainly buy Tony’s, but a) print deadlines mean I can’t yet know – did he/has he won? Winned? He should have/should have had/was set in hindsight to, and b) if I can’t master the simple grammar of time travel, I suspect I would not be an unalloyed success with his choux.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b098673ee7205ae7290595cfebd616f7b372c27\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/23/1429791437462/9f021915-4def-4ecb-a41e-fb4c1f5be862-460x316.jpeg\" alt=\"chefs on trial gilpin review\" width=\"460\" height=\"316\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reality bites: Alex Polizzi’s Chefs on Trial in the Lake District.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Twofour</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Across the way, in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05sczfp\"><strong>Chefs on Trial</strong></a>, Alex Polizzi was finally able to settle into a decent hotel. How she must have dreamed of a temporary absence of roaches in the wainscotting, bogies in the bath and the pompous recalcitrant nincompoops who run such establishments, and of trotting out her dull but effective formula for success (savage the sprawling menu, paint the rooms magnolia, er, that’s it). Here, she was in a delightful Lake District place run by a sharp, kindly family willing to pay a new executive chef a six-figure salary to garner them a Michelin star. The hoops the contestants jumped through – man-management skills, portion control, winning over the family – were every bit as important as the cooking, and incidentally there <em>must</em> be a more felicitous phrase than “fine dining”, urgh. This was fascinating, all week, but then you remembered they weren’t purely on, effectively, a talent show. This was the very lives of the chefs, willing to move heaven, earth and families for the job: and the disappointment on expulsion concomitantly far more bruising.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/23/1429790369082/w1a-review-bonneville-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Timing beyond reproach’ (left to right): Hugh Bonneville, Monica Dolan, Sarah Parish and Andrew Brooke in BBC satire W1A.
