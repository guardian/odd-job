The answer is ‘no’, and doing so hurts the environment and your wallet</p>","byline":"Luisa Dillner","body":"<p>It’s the world’s bestselling soft drink – more people buy bottled water than fruit juice or fizzy drinks. In 2013, the UK glugged <a href=\"http://www.britishbottledwater.org/vital-statistics.asp\">2.4bn litres of it</a>, and by 2014 this had risen to 2.6bn litres. Yet, remarkably, you can get this particular beverage from the tap, for free. Bottled water can cost between 500 to 1000 times more than tap water. So, is it healthier? And does it taste better? It certainly has a hefty carbon footprint – with some reports estimating <a href=\"http://elua.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/Elua-Bottled-Water-and-Our-Environment.pdf\">around 82.8g of CO2 for a half-litre bottle</a> – not insignificant when everyone’s drinking it. Recycling rates are improving but, in America, for example, it’s estimated that only a quarter of bottles get recycled. So is it really so much better that it’s worth both paying for and harming the planet? Or should you stop buying it?</p> \n<h2><strong>The solution</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>It’s simple: yes, you should stop buying it. There is no evidence it is better for you and, indeed, it may be less safe than tap water. Two thirds of water from the tap comes from surface water (reservoirs, lakes, rivers) and the rest from ground water (underground geological formations that store rainwater). It is subject to stringent treatment standards – according to Professor Paul Younger, a hydro geochemist, these make it safer than bottled water. The Drinking Water Inspectorate regulates mains water (99.97% of samples pass the strict standards) while local authorities watch over bottled water plants. Tap water has a residual amount of chlorine in, which you usually can’t taste, but which makes it more resistant to bacteria. If you think you can taste chloride, then sticking the water under a cover in the fridge for half an hour gets rid of it. Concerns that tap water contains oestrogens from contraceptive pills being peed out or that it has passed through the kidneys of 10 people are not valid, says Younger. Water companies have to treat wastewater before it can reach natural waters and there is no evidence (from extensive studies) that oestrogens are present in tap water.</p> \n<p>A study of over 1,000 people in Belfast found that they couldn’t tell the difference between tap and bottled water when asked which was the more pleasant, pure, natural and refreshing. Bottled water can come from springs or from the mains. It can also be treated, for example, to have iron removed. Its success is due to excellent marketing and our laziness in not buying reusable bottles and filling them with tap water. Furthermore, Younger says if you decide to ditch bottled water, you don’t need to compensate by filtering what comes out of the tap. “It’s hocus pocus,” he says.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432910465076/Bottle-of-water-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There is no evidence it is better for you and indeed it may be less safe than tap water.

But what initially appear to be random occurrences gradually start to feel anything but – could these people be somehow emotionally and sensorially connected? The first episode of this new drama takes a riskily long time to begin to reveal its mysteries but it’s never less than intriguing and, given that it’s the handiwork of Matrix creators Andy and Lana Wachowski, fans of mysterious, portentous sci-fi drama will feel inclined to trust that persistence will be rewarded.</p> \n<p><em>Netflix</em></p> \n<h2>TV: Frankie Boyle’s Election Autopsy</h2> \n<p>“The next five years are going to be like The Hunger Games without the games.” Yeah, we know Frankie. But sometimes, all you can do is laugh. There’s been much talk of the Labour party’s need for self-examination since 7 May. But no one escapes with their foibles unexplored here. Whether it’s the gobby tweets of 20-year-old SNP MP Mhairi Black, the vanishing Lib Dems or Ukip’s branded hi-vis jackets (“In case you’re worried that people won’t know you’re a c*nt in the dark”), everyone is in line for a righteous Boyle tongue-lashing.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p02qs82x/frankie-boyles-election-autopsy\" title=\"\"><em>BBC iPlayer</em></a></p> \n<h2>TV: Louie</h2> \n<p>“We’re the future.

This is the latest sign that when it comes to personal style, millennials just want to be comfortable. </p> \n<p>At 36, I’m just barely bending under the millennial limbo bar. I have one foot squarely placed in Generation X, which might explain my willingness to wear high heels and Spanx on an alarmingly regular basis. My firmly mid-to-late-20s friends, however, scoff at any garment that could temporarily change the shape of the body part it’s on. They live in oversized tees and knit pants – a uniform that, on me, I’m pretty sure looks like pajamas, even when worn with their footwear of choice: slip-on sneakers like Vans or flat, wide-strap sandals like Birkenstocks.</p> \n<p>“I don’t wear anything that takes too much effort or feels fussy,” Carly Shatzkin, a 26-year-old graphic designer, assured me. “Comfort doesn’t have to be sacrificed for style and I think more brands are appreciating that.”</p> \n<p>There’s no greater evidence of this than in the ubiquity of chic, non-activewear sweatpants at retailers of all price points.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0a8bddc459704eded3a7dd35a8243e5406a400bf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/30/1432994689668/0a9ec19d-c57d-4e78-b648-5edf72f2c288-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sweatpants and heels\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It takes weeks, if not months, to find the perfect pair of dressy sweatpants that will never even see the inside of a gym’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: glowdotcom</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Dressy sweatpants encapsulate the ultimate millennial dream: looking good without any effort, being trendy without being try-hard,” 24-year-old fashion and beauty writer Kelly Dougher told me. “The irony of this is the fact that it takes weeks, if not months, to find the perfect pair of dressy sweatpants that will never even see the inside of a gym: not too baggy but not too clingy, the perfect shade of marbled grey, cropped at just the right point at one’s ankles. If you have to spend upwards of $100 to achieve this studied slouchiness, then so be it.”</p> \n<p>Also ironic: I, personally, would feel the need to wear Spanx or some other brand of shapewear with my non-gym sweatpants, to achieve that smoother, I’ve-been-going-to-the-gym look.

There will be just 12 international all-female teams, far fewer than their male counterparts, and it won’t include women’s league teams, but many have acknowledged this as another important step towards equality in the game – Fifa has not featured female players in any of its 22 previous editions, despite having sold more than 100m copies worldwide.</p> \n<p>It is not the only piece of good news women’s football has had recently: last week, the BBC gave its first <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/26/liverpool-asisat-oshoala-wins-bbc-womens-footballer-of-year-award\" title=\"\">Women’s Footballer of the Year</a> award to 20-year-old Nigeria and Liverpool forward Asisat Oshoala. Meanwhile, the Women’s World Cup kicks off in Canada on Saturday, with Swedish broadcaster TV4 keen to show its support for gender equality by calling the competition “VM i fotboll”, which means, simply, World Cup (<a href=\"http://www.thelocal.se/20150528/swedes-push-for-gender-equal-world-cup-for-women\" title=\"\">although Fifa is not quite so keen on the idea</a>).</p> \n<p>Footballer Shannen Meadows, who captains Goldsmiths university’s women’s football team, is a regular player of Fifa and says she is “thrilled” to see women finally being included in the (console) game. “There’s still sexism across most sports, but more in contact sport, such as rugby and football,” says Meadows. “Look at when Sian Massey-Ellis is an official at one of the Premier League games – her offside decisions are forever being questioned. I feel that in order for sexism to be removed from the football industry it needs to be tackled in the same way racism is:&nbsp;with players, both male and female, promoting equality.”</p> \n<p>While women’s football fans will be pleased to know that the number of&nbsp;female players is five times what it was in 1985, it is a shame the increased focus on women’s football comes at a time when Fifa is facing perhaps the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/28/fifa-blatter-resolves-ride-out-scandal-bid-for-fifth-presidential-term\" title=\"\">worst crisis in its history</a>, with 14&nbsp;senior officials arrested for corruption last week.</p> \n<p>However, there is some satisfaction to be had in knowing that the popularity of women’s football is on the up, even as the&nbsp;frenzy surrounding Sepp Blatter – the man who once suggested women should wear&nbsp;more “feminine clothes” to&nbsp;increase the popularity of the&nbsp;game (“They could, for example, have tighter shorts”) – continues.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432925337018/A-level-playing-field-for-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A level playing field for women's football?

Dr David Hazafy, a scientist at Queen’s University Belfast, believes there is another problem: those afraid of getting skin cancer do not venture outside and deprive themselves of the vitamin D their body needs.</p> \n<p>His solution is a simple and cheap piece of plastic which can be tied around the wrist and contains an ink which disappears when the user has been exposed to the recommended daily dose of sun for their skin tone.</p> \n<p>“It is for people who care about the potential dangers but still want to have some fun – mothers, parents for their children or for themselves, older people, people who want to know when it is still safe,” Hazafy says.</p> \n<p>The wristband can also be used with sunscreens to mimic the reaction of the skin to sunlight, allowing parents to see how long their children should stay outside during the day, says Hazafy, who works at the school of chemistry and chemical engineering at Queen’s.</p> \n<p>“The sunshine gets the negative press. People are quite scared of getting skin cancer so they don’t go out at all. They cover themselves and then there is a problem with vitamin D deficiencies. You need a little bit of sunshine to create vitamin D. If you don’t go out at all because you think the sun is dangerous, you don’t get it” he says.</p> \n<p>While sunshine is mostly made up of UV A rays, UV B rays are responsible for 80% of skin cancer cases, and this is what the technology focuses on. </p> \n<p>The ink on the plastic wristband is made up of dye and a photocatalyst, a substance which harvests energy from sunlight to cause chemical reactions. When the photocatalyst absorbs UV light, the energy drives a change in the dye: so as the sunlight is absorbed, the colour slowly disappears. When it disappears completely, the maximum amount of UV B light for the day has been absorbed and the wearer knows that they should withdraw from the sun.</p> \n<p>If sunscreen is added to the plastic, it will again mimic how sunscreen acts when it is added to the skin, prolonging the amount of time that the user can be exposed.<br /></p> \n<p>As different skin types can take varying amounts of sun, the ink can be altered so that it changes at different rates,says Hazafy. When the product comes to market, there will likely be three different formulations for varying skin types which will allow most people use the bands, he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76152d653419d7a23a70dfefa76a0b35e7680447\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433077243114/891b2fe7-a1a3-45de-93b7-cd066ef94c68-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chemist Dr David Hazafy from Queen's University Belfast, has developed a wristband which changes colour once the wearer reaches the point when they have been exposed to too much sunlight.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chemist Dr David Hazafy from Queen’s University Belfast, has developed a wristband which changes colour once the wearer reaches the point when they have been exposed to too much sunlight.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul McErlane</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dermatologists “calculate the times, how much UV light you can take without getting sunburnt and that is what the colour change tells you”, he says.</p> \n<p>Behind the company set up to commercialise the product, SunCatalyst Laboratories, is Hazafy and Prof Andrew Mills, also from the school of chemistry and chemical engineering at Queen’s University. </p> \n<p>What the final product will look like has not yet been decided. As the dye is not destroyed when it is exposed to sunlight, it can ‘recharge’ or return to its original form overnight. This could result in the technology either being on a permanent band, such as those used by charities, or on a piece of biodegradable plastic which could then be thrown away, says Hazafy. It can be waterproofed by sandwiching the plastic with another plastic, he says.</p> \n<p>The product itself is “very inexpensive” to make and could retail for between &pound;5 and &pound;10 for a package of disposal bands which would last for a two week holiday or be sold with sunscreen, he says. It will also be possible to print with the ink so that messages can come up on the wristband when the maximum exposure is met, says Hazafy, who aims to have it on the shelves for summer 2016. The NHS says that there are over 100,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin cancer – cancers in the upper layer of the skin which are caused by overexposure to UV light – in the UK every year.</p> \n<h2>Treating cancer with a virus</h2> \n<p>Researchers in cancer therapies have found that patients with aggressive skin cancer have been treated successfully with a drug based on the herpes virus. The treatment mark a success for virotherapy, where one disease is used to attack another. Trial results have shown that the therapy, which is not yet licensed, could prolong survival for a number of years in some patients.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <ul> \n  <li>You can read our archive of The innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/business/series/the-innovators\">here </a>or <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.</li> \n </ul> \n</blockquote>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433074354871/7dcc7c82-d617-4708-a302-04154bedca55-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Gavin Hellier/Gavin Hellier/JAI/Corbis","altText":"Blue Lagoon and Belcekiz beach, Oludeniz, near Fethiye, Mediterranean Coast, Turkey.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Gavin Hellier/Gavin Hellier/JAI/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/31/1433077244386/891b2fe7-a1a3-45de-93b7-cd066ef94c68-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chemist Dr David Hazafy from Queen’s University Belfast, has developed a wristband which changes colour once the wearer reaches the point when they have been exposed to too much sunlight.

Now, in a cartoon strip posted to Instagram and Twitter on Sunday afternoon by singer Matty Healy, it is suggested the band – whose debut album was a No 1 hit – might be disappearing for some unspecified period from that date.</p> \n<p>“Our projected identity must change not only visually but philosophically – how do you do that?” the comic-strip-cum-statement-cum-manifesto read. “Firstly we must reclaim our identity &amp; repossess our control of it … Until then there won’t be any pop music or dancing with long hair … The hardest part of any relationship is to say goodbye … So we must leave, with a parting ‘we love you.’”</p> \n<p>It seems unlikely that the band have split – their manager had previously tweeted that he had heard demos for their second album – but it does appear some dramaticchange is on the horizon for the group.</p> \n<p>Fans took to social media to speculate.
