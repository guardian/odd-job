What used to feel like a slightly grotty product is now a mainstream staple for any woman who’s had to endure lank hair and a stringy fringe. Ingenious and gamechanging though they are, dry shampoos have not been without their problems. Users will know that chalky, patchy, flaky residue has been par for the course and required vigorous brushing to shake off the powdered wig look.

Poaching for meat, and money, soared. Mark Butcher of <a href=\"http://www.imvelosafarilodges.com/\">Imvelo Safaris</a>, who runs camps there says he saw the heavy price paid by the wildlife: “When people are hungry, they don’t worry about conservation. The wildlife gets left in the care of poorly motivated and ill-equipped bureaucrats.”</p> \n<p>When Tanzania closed its border with Kenya between 1977 and 1983, visitors to the Serengeti dropped from 70,000 a year to around 10,000. The loss in revenue caused a 60% decline in anti-poaching patrols and a rapid rise in poaching. Rhino disappeared, elephant numbers dropped and meat poaching skyrocketed. Similar things are now happening in northern Mozambique, where a government-backed survey has estimated that half of the country’s elephants (almost 10,000) <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/may/26/poachers-killed-half-mozambiques-elephants-in-five-years\">have been illegally killed in the past five years</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4af3adb1b858ade247e28f1fc291e86d133e4562\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/29/1432902710534/fbe9e38c-43dd-48a3-b219-fd1cf117943a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A lioness surrounded by safari tourists in the Maasai Mara national park.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lioness surrounded by safari tourists in the Maasai Mara national park.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/picture/2015/mar/19/lewa-wildlife-conservancy-kenya\">World view: Lewa wildlife conservancy, Kenya</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Like many in the safari business, Butcher thinks Kenya’s conservancy movement is its brightest hope. This has seen large areas of Kenya protected by small landowners pledging land to communal conservation zones. Franchised safari camps pay landowners according to the number of tourists they take. “Communities set aside land for wildlife because it’s financially in their interests,” says Butcher. “But in the absence of tourists, poachers give the incentives.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://sdt.unwto.org/content/unwto-briefing-paper-towards-measuring-economic-value-wildlife-watching-tourism-africa\">A report in March</a> by the United Nations World Tourism Organisation (UNWTO) highlighted the scarcity of data on the economic value of wildlife tourism in Africa, but surveyed data from 48 government bodies and 145 tour operators from 31 African countries and concluded that poaching “threatened the tourism sector’s long-term sustainability”. However, only 50% of the operators were directly funding anti-poaching initiatives or engaging in conservation projects.</p> \n<p>Encouraging them, and getting tourist numbers back up is vital. Jonathan Scott, who presents the BBC’s Big Cat Diary and has lived in Kenya for 40 years, says: “If the world is serious about helping to prevent poaching, we need those tourist dollars.”</p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2015/5/27/1432740428534/Elephant-walks-past-the-E-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Dawn patrol: elephants are highly prized by tourists and poachers alike.

What you need is a&nbsp;Zone Dome – a huge curved screen that sits in front of a treadmill, playing footage of running trails from around the world to make you feel as if you’re really there. It’s a fancy Google Street View, basically.</p> \n<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong> For now, it’s&nbsp;available only at selected gyms around the country, so you’ll need to be a member to use it.</p> \n<p><strong>What does it promise?</strong> “The ultimate immersive running experience”, apparently. The fact that the footage plays at the pace of your run is said to be so motivating and engaging that you’ll run for an average of 25% longer than on a&nbsp;normal treadmill.</p> \n<p><strong>What’s it actually like? </strong>The visual highlight of my current running route is a local Cup a Soup factory, so I had high hopes for the Zone Dome. The thought of spending the duration of a run on a beach, or an arctic mountain trail, sounded especially appealing. And, to some extent, it works. However, there’s still room for improvement. The treadmill matches the speed of the film, but not the incline, which seems like a hugely wasted opportunity.

If we touch in passing, it is clumsiness, not affection.</p> \n<p>It didn’t start well. Almost as soon as the wedding service was over your libido, which was never that high, plummeted. I rationalised it in so many ways over the years: it must be my fault somehow (no), illness (all tests proved negative), the stresses of a demanding job (though mine was infinitely more stressful than yours). I could not have children, so that was never an issue. Had it been one, I might have taken a different course, but I will never know.</p> \n<p>Eventually, when we were comfortably retired and financially secure, I ran out of excuses. With great difficulty, I got you to accept couples therapy. It was a disaster. You felt no attraction to me, had not felt any for years, but you saw no reason to think any more deeply than that.</p> \n<p>Things did change then: my life now is almost totally outside our marriage, but the damage to me has been immense. I can’t envisage an intimate life again: this one hurt too much. I feel demeaned as a&nbsp;woman; my own libido has now disappeared, crushed by years of rejection. I even flinch when a man hugs or kisses me in a nonsexual way, and it unnerves me for days.</p> \n<p>So why do I let it continue? Good question. Because I do at least have a good social life and no financial worries, which many women my age lack. Because I fear similar failure again. I can now never be the woman I might have been: the damage is done.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Tell us what you’re really thinking at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:mind@theguardian.com\" title=\"\">mind@theguardian.com</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/5/20/1432129928648/WIRT-the-celibate-wife-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Lo Cole for the Guardian","credit":"Lo Cole for the Guardian","altText":"WIRT: the celibate wife","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Lo Cole for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-30T05:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-05-30T05:00:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":24,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Marriage","Family","Life and style","Sex"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/marriage","webTitle":"Marriage"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"What I'm really thinking","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/what-im-really-thinking"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/30/what-really-thinking-celibate-wife","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48zjg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/30/what-really-thinking-celibate-wife","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/30/what-really-thinking-celibate-wife"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/5/20/1432129928648/WIRT-the-celibate-wife-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"  Illustration: Lo Cole for the Guardian","credit":"Lo Cole for the Guardian","altText":"WIRT: the celibate wife","cleanCaption":"  Illustration: Lo Cole for the Guardian"}},"importance":4,"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[]},{"title":"Take the biscuit with these jammie dodger and bourbon cream recipes","rawTitle":"Take the biscuit with these jammie dodger and bourbon cream recipes","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/may/30/old-school-biscuit-recipes-jammie-dodgers-bourbon-creams","title":"Take the biscuit with these jammie dodger and bourbon cream recipes","trailText":"<strong>Rosie bakes: </strong>Old-school biscuits are hard to beat.

These twists on two all-time favourites – the jammie dodger and the bourbon cream – make teatime treats so good you’ll have a hard time not scoffing the lot</p>","byline":"Rosie Reynolds","body":"<p>I would love to be able to tell you that these biscuits evoke nostalgic memories of erstwhile days. However, I would be lying; I eat far too many of these family favourites for them to be anything but a vivid memory. They’ve been around for as long as I can remember, nestled within a big red box next to those impossible-to-make and even more impossible-to-resist pink wafers.</p> \n<p>Granted, some things are best left to the magicians at biscuit kingdom HQ. However, a few of the old-school classics can be improved with a little kitchen tinkering to bring them up to date. I am hopeful that the few simple efforts that go into making these biscuits will prevent you from scoffing the lot before offering them to others – which so often happens with a packet of their shop-bought counterparts!</p> \n<h2><strong>Jammie dodgers</strong></h2> \n<p>Cornflour and ground almonds create a rich, crumbly texture, while lemon zest balances out the sweetness of the jam – choose your favourite flavour for a tailor-made dodger. Perfectly partnered with a hot cuppa.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Makes about 15 </strong><br />150g butter, softened <br />85g caster sugar, plus extra for dusting <br />Zest of 1 lemon <br />150g plain flour, plus extra for dusting <br />50g ground almonds<br />25g cornflour <br />125g jam (such as seedless raspberry)</p> \n<p>1 Beat the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl until really pale and fluffy. Stir in the lemon zest.</p> \n<p>2 Add the flour, ground almonds and cornflour, then beat until the mixture is combined – there should be no visible signs of flour. Bring the biscuit dough together with your hands into a ball, knead briefly, then wrap in clingfilm and chill for 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>3 Remove the dough from the fridge and roll out on a lightly floured work surface to a thickness of about 5mm. Use a 6cm round cutter to make around 30 circles of dough. Use a 2cm cutter (a bottle top works perfectly here) to stamp out a hole in the centre of half of the biscuits – these will become the tops of your dodgers. Re-roll any offcuts and repeat the stamping out process to make more biscuits.</p> \n<p>4 Transfer to a couple of lined baking sheets – I find it helpful to keep the tops and bottoms separate – and place in the fridge for a further 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>5 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Transfer your biscuits to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until pale golden and sandy. Remove from the oven and allow to cool completely on the tray.</p> \n<p>6 Once cool, put a scant teaspoon of jam on to the full biscuit bases. Spread the jam out with the back of the spoon in an even layer – don’t go right to the edge or you with end up losing jam when you sandwich with the top half. Pop the biscuits with the holes on top and sprinkle a little more sugar over the exposed jam. Serve immediately.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2013/jun/10/best-biscuit-recipes-dan-lepard\">Dan Lepard's baking: 10 best biscuit recipes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> \n<h2><strong>Bourbon creams</strong></h2> \n<p>I have added ground and stem ginger to these biscuit sandwiches for a more grown-up flavour, but feel free to leave it out if you are a traditionalist. The joy of a bourbon is prising the two halves apart, quickly gobbling the un-iced half then savouring the creamy remainder – I have been intentionally heavy-handed with the buttercream filling as it’s the best bit.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Makes about 12 </strong><br />125g butter, softened <br />75g soft light brown sugar <br />75g caster sugar <br />1&frac12; tsp ground ginger <br />1 tsp vanilla extract <br />1 medium egg<br />175g plain flour, plus extra for dusting <br />50g cocoa powder</p> \n<p><strong> For the filling</strong><br />75g plain chocolate, roughly chopped <br />75g butter <br />25g soft brown sugar <br />75g icing sugar<br />2 balls stem ginger in syrup, drained and finely chopped <br />1 tbsp ginger syrup from the jar</p> \n<p>1 Put the butter, sugars, ground ginger, vanilla and egg into a mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon to beat the ingredients together until fully combined.</p> \n<p>2 Sift the flour and cocoa powder into a separate bowl, then gradually add to the wet ingredients, beating as you go until no lumps of butter and sugar mixture remain. You will end up with a slightly sticky yet firm dough. Bring it together with your hands, wrap in clingfilm and chill for 30 minutes.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/07/10-best-jam-recipes\">The 10 best jam recipes</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>3 Line a couple of baking sheets with baking paper and preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Remove the biscuit dough from the fridge, then roll out on a well-floured work surface to a thickness of 5mm. Use a ruler to measure out a 30cm x 20cm rectangle. Trim to size and set aside the offcuts to be re-rolled later.</p> \n<p>4 Divide the dough into 5 rectangles horizontally and 4 vertically. Use a palette knife to transfer half of the biscuits to the lined trays, leaving around 2cm between each to allow for spreading. Roll up any offcuts and shape roughly to the same size and shape. Use a cocktail stick to make a pattern around the edge of half of the biscuits. These will become the tops of your biscuits. Return to the fridge for 15 minutes.</p> \n<p>5 Transfer the biscuits to the oven and bake for 8-10 minutes, or until sandy in texture – the biscuits will look remarkably like shop-bought bourbons. Allow them to cool completely on the tray.</p> \n<p>6 Meanwhile, make the filling. Melt the chocolate in a bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water. Remove from the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Beat the butter, brown sugar and icing sugar together until smooth, then fold in the melted chocolate, chopped ginger and ginger syrup. Stir to combine, then leave at room temperature.</p> \n<p>7 To build your bourbon creams, spread the filling over the bottom half of the biscuits and sandwich with the patterned tops.

The colour it describes as “goldbusters”, but to picture the actual hue, you have to think of some kind of human effluent (bile, say) given a metallic shimmer. In town, it&nbsp;darts and scuttles like a tiny, exotic insect. On&nbsp;longer journeys, I&nbsp;could hardly believe it had only a one-litre engine, so poky was it. It does 0–60 in 9.9 seconds, and everything seems so effortless. The claimed top speed, 121mph, is quite something, though I didn’t come anywhere near to verifying it.</p> \n<p>What you notice, as a regular civilian driver, is a sense of ever-readiness. There were times when I&nbsp;couldn’t tell what was cool and what was a gimmick, what was modern and what a cut-corner. The system it uses instead of a satnav – you download <a href=\"http://www.bringgo.com/\" title=\"\">BringGo</a>, then plug in your phone and the screen shows on the display – feels a bit second-rate, but it works, and fast. Gunning through Brixton, trying to get to a civil-unrest event before anyone (everyone) had been arrested, I&nbsp;darted in and out of traffic, while the photographer buzzed the folding roof in and out. I lack the poetry in my soul to understand the point of a&nbsp;roof that opens, but he and the children were delighted.</p> \n<p>We arrived at our destination (not the children; I rarely take them to civil unrest), I dropped him off and hared off. This is the way to live, I&nbsp;thought; unencumbered, dainty, fast, always leaving someone else in a fix, and disappearing.</p> \n<p>Look, it has its downsides: there are only two seatbelts on the back seat. There are only three doors. There is an unconscionable number of airbags (six), and almost no room for any passengers. But if you’re intending to stick to the driver’s seat, you’ll be pleasantly surprised; it’s a dinky but rather tall car, for its range. The windscreen is an expanse, and the steering wheel is large, adjustable and heated (me neither).</p> \n<p>Combined economy is 55.4mpg. At 119g/km, the emissions rating felt designed to fall below a threshold, like a house priced for stamp duty: carrying so little weight, with such a&nbsp;lot of refinement to the engine, this could have gone lower. And, ultimately, there are cars in the world only 5% bigger that are 50% more practical (not that I ever would, but God knows where you’d put a dog in this car).
