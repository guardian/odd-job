He was a bifurcated man, making cute movies for kids, his primary fanbase as a wrestler, such as Tooth Fairy, Game Plan and Race To Witch Mountain (I call these his “Pet Rock” movies), and bad movies for adults, iffy remakes like Walking Tall, and bad sports movies like Gridiron Gang, and illiterate thrillers like Faster.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UN1G4BSyIos\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UN1G4BSyIos?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>But the signs of his genius were already evident. His gay bodyguard in Be Cool was the only worthwhile thing in that D-minus Elmore Leonard adaptation. (Also worth underlining: macho man plays gay character, and it wasn’t homophobic or cheap, which is something of a precedent, and entirely commendable.) He proved his comedy chops again in Reno 911!: Miami and Get Smart. And there were pleasing oddities that suggested a venturesome actor not content to do as his agents told him, like Richard Kelly’s extraordinary heroic failure of an epic, Southland Tales.</p> \n<p>Then he wisely attached himself to the slumping Fast/Furious franchise, a move that paid off earlier this year when the latest instalment coolly pounded a billion bucks out of the global box office. And then there was Pain &amp; Gain, the strangest, vilest, possibly greatest movie of Michael Bay’s career, a bonehead kinda-masterpiece I’m still trying to figure out. By that time he was the top-grossing actor of 2013.</p> \n<p>As he has refined his brand, Johnson has stepped out. His recurrent appearances on SNL, playing Hulk-like, shape-shifting Potus “The Rock” Obama, have been ridiculously endearing (especially whenever he flings Ted Cruz out of a window), and you haven’t lived until you’ve seen him lip-sync Taylor Swift’s Shake It Off with Jimmy Fallon (“Oh Jimmy, your ass is gettin’ ready to know Tay-Tay!”). There is an unadulterated joy to be derived from watching a performer make all the right movies, one after another.

When faced with the challenging prospect of discussing previous employment, graduates should be ready to add a positive spin on even the most reasonable of complaints. While we’re on the subject, keep your integrity intact and never lie. Being able to trust your employees is pivotal, so being caught out in an interview can mean an instant rejection. </p> \n<h2>Inappropriate interview attire</h2> \n<p>While it can depend on the job sector, the general rule of thumb is formal clothing. First impressions are vital and demonstrate how seriously you are taking the opportunity. If a graduate turns up in jeans and flip flops, they shouldn’t expect a warm welcome. The best advice is to always take a conservative approach and be well groomed - polished shoes and irons at the ready. You need to fit into a commercial, professional environment which often means you need to be willing to sacrifice youthful fashion for the job.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/what-wear-job-interview-fashion-dress-impress\">Dress to impress: what to wear for a job interview</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Talking too much or too little </h2> \n<p>Your answers should be like concise mini-essays with a clear beginning, middle and end. Too short and it looks like you have little to say, too lengthy and you’ve probably babbled and missed the point. Be composed, think before you answer and employ structure. </p> \n<h2>Not enough research</h2> \n<p>This can either be a lack of research into the company and role, or not enough preparation for tricky interview questions. Although nerves come with the territory, if a graduate is both anxious and underprepared, they won’t come across well. You therefore need to go the extra mile when carrying out any research. Candidates should memorise a few key background facts, find out more about who will be interviewing them, such as finding them on LinkedIn or Twitter, and familiarise themselves with the company’s market and wider online presence – not just their own website.</p> \n<h2>Lack of questions</h2> \n<p>An interview isn’t just about why a graduate’s past experiences and skills can be applied to the particular role. It’s also a test of their interest in the position. This demonstrates your enthusiasm and as a result, strengthens your credibility as a candidate. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Be careful: asking questions about things you should already know illustrates a lack of research.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>But be careful: asking questions about things you should already know illustrates a lack of research. Perhaps you could ask how a current affairs issue might affect their business. This shows you’ve given the company serious thought. Prepare a list of questions to ask so you don’t forget them. Where possible, relate them to your interviewer and their experiences. A great example would be: “What do you like most about working here?” There is also an opportunity to seek feedback. Asking the interviewer if they have any concerns about you can allow you to overcome any potential objections – but make sure you accept these concerns gracefully.<br /></p> \n<h2>How can graduates make a good impression during an interview?</h2> \n<p>First impressions are key: <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-6570.1975.tb01383.x/abstract\">research</a> has found most interviews are decided in the first two to three minutes. Make sure you practise your strong and professional handshake accompanied by a gracious smile and confident body language. But don’t let the confidence end there. From the moment you press the buzzer, you should come across as professional and dynamic. Making confident small talk with both the receptionist and the hiring managers will allow you to expose a little of your personality without the pressure of answering: “Where do you see yourself in five years?” </p> \n<p>Confidence (not arrogance) is important. Fight through the nerves and give your potential new employer a good impression of the real you. Essentially you have nothing to lose, so just go for it. Also, interviewers generally don’t want to catch candidates out – they want you to do well. Recruitment is a business challenge and employers go into interviews hoping, praying even, that the candidate is the solution.<br /></p> \n<p>Self-analysis is another good area to add to your pile of research and something that candidates regularly forget. Look at the job specification and consider what the client might be looking for. Now think about your own achievements and all the challenges you have overcome. Finally, try and match the two together. Without self-reflection, you may forget key life experiences that you could have applied to those tricky competency questions.<br /></p> \n<p><em>Steve Agace is director of sales at the <a href=\"http://www.grb.uk.com/\">Graduate Recruitment Bureau</a></em><br /></p> \n<p><strong>Looking for a job?

The family who run the business are warm and welcoming and breakfast includes homemade cakes, fresh fruit from the garden and coffee. For the brave, a further 1,000 steps take you up to the Cammino degli Dei (Path of the Gods), a cliffside walk with views across the coast that should have a place on any walker’s list. There is a beach just over the road with an outdoor bar that serves some of the best fresh fish in town. <br /><em>From €40pp pn or €240 per week, Via Arienzo, 43-84017, Positano, (+39) 339 8390809, </em><em><a href=\"http://rifugiodeglidei.it/\">rifugiodeglidei.it</a><br /></em><strong>ID8078709</strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Otranto, one of Puglia’s gems</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"624f727a6e05a95a40b3ef186f38dfceb009c660\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432731951548/d018a4f4-080e-4b6a-bcc9-2f91e8b01ec5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Otranto old town.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Otranto old town.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marco Cristofori/Marco Cristofori/Robert Harding World Imagery/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong> </strong>Otranto is one of those little fortified towns that just makes you go “whoa!” and reach for the camera constantly.

for his favourite author – and for the teenager who discovers his unpublished works</p>","byline":"James Smythe","body":"<p>Writers are obsessed with other writers. So many of the greats have, somewhere in their&nbsp;oeuvre, at least one novel in which an author is&nbsp;either writing a book, or is struggling with writer’s block. It is a narrative writers relish: that somebody can make&nbsp;their fortune from nothing other than telling stories, and trying to&nbsp;tell them well.</p> \n<p>For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/series/rereading-stephen-king\" title=\"\">King</a>, it is a rich vein that he has mined on more than one occasion. Some of his most enduring works feature writers: <em>Salem’s Lot</em>, <em>It</em>, <em>The Shining</em>, <em>The Dark Half</em> and many more&nbsp;feature writers of either novels or&nbsp;plays. But King’s most famous work&nbsp;about an author is <em>Misery</em>, a truly terrifying look at what happens when a&nbsp;keen fan strays onto the wrong side of obsession. It is commonly read as a metaphor for addiction, but can also be taken at face value as an investigation into the love that fans feel for the writers who have changed their lives.</p> \n<p>It is that same part of the vein that King draws from here, in the follow-up to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/jun/04/mr-mercedes-stephen-king-review-novel-crime-thriller\" title=\"\"><em>Mr Mercedes</em></a>, last year’s crime thriller. In that book, retired detective Bill Hodges chased down the mass-murdering psychopath Brady Hartsfield, leaving him in a coma. By the time this sequel begins, Hodges and his associates have formed the titular investigation agency, which eschews criminal cases&nbsp;in favour of mysteries that will&nbsp;never involve the police. It is the thrill of the&nbsp;chase that King wants to capture, rather than the nitty-gritty of&nbsp;crime‑scene dusting.</p> \n<p><em>Finders Keepers</em> introduces us to Morris Bellamy, as big a fan of the (invented) novelist John Rothstein as&nbsp;you could imagine. Rothstein is American literary royalty, a towering amalgam of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/philiproth\" title=\"\">Roth</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/jdsalinger\" title=\"\">Salinger </a>and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/johnupdike\" title=\"\">Updike</a>.His fame comes from his Runner books, a trilogy that tips its hat to Updike’s Rabbit novels. But Morris – who is nursing, in true Kingian style, a burgeoning tendency towards psychopathy – hates the third novel. He has heard rumours that Rothstein wrote other books, and keeps them in a vault at his home. Wanting to read them, he does the natural thing: he murders his hero and steals the first drafts, burying them under a tree near his home until the heat on the crime dies down.</p> \n<p>When Morris goes to prison for an unrelated (and truly heinous) crime, the notebooks are abandoned to rot. Forty years later, they’re found by Pete&nbsp;Saubers, a teenager who now lives&nbsp;in Morris’s old house, along with&nbsp;the money Morris also stole from Rothstein’s vault. Pete puts the money to good use, saving his family from financial strife (caused, in a delicious chain of consequence, by the opening events of <em>Mr Mercedes</em>), and he too falls in literary love with the writer who created the notebooks. Eventually Morris gets out of prison, and all he has been dreaming of during his incarceration is getting those notebooks. Cue: the chase.</p> \n<p>Structurally, the book is an almost constant build of momentum, growing in pace and tension until it finally explodes. That much is similar to <em>Mr Mercedes</em>. But, unlike that book, this is very much not Bill Hodges’s novel. He doesn’t appear until near the halfway point, like some detective-ex-machina. By the book’s close, it’s abundantly clear that he isn’t the focus of this series: that honour belongs to the coma-bound Brady. These two novels are about repercussions: the effects of&nbsp;Brady’s actions, of the recession, of&nbsp;injury and illness, of retirement. They are about leaving the past behind, and yet how it will always come back to haunt you.</p> \n<p>Which brings us back to the theme of writers. Morris wants to read Rothstein’s unpublished work in order to discover that the book he disliked was an aberration. Morris may not have developed, but writers do; and we&nbsp;have to go with them, to see where they’ll take us. That’s the greatest joy of this book: watching as King still makes it all&nbsp;seem so effortless, and 55 novels in, manages to thrill with every page.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> To order <em>Finders Keepers</em> for &pound;16 (RRP &pound;20) go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/290809/\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

My mortgage for the property is &pound;623 a month and I have nine years left on it with &pound;63,000 outstanding. The house is worth approximately &pound;120,000 so I have &pound;57,000 in equity.</p> \n<p>I am looking to buy a new home with my wife for around &pound;130,000. She too, owns a property worth &pound;115,000, pays &pound;450 a month for her mortgage and has about &pound;20,000 in equity. We don’t know whether to sell both properties and buy a new house, or alternatively rent one of them out. But we think owning three houses could be too risky.</p> \n<p>Could I charge my friend &pound;780 a month – which is 125% of my &pound;623 mortgage payment – and take equity as a deposit for the new house? <strong>MF</strong></p> \n<p><strong>A</strong> I think the friend to whom you let your house is best placed to tell you whether he or she is prepared to see a 30% increase in the rent. It could well be that you’ll have to find yourself a new tenant. Besides, increasing the rent isn’t the way to get at the equity you have in the property. To do that, you need to either sell the house or increase the mortgage on it. </p> \n<p>The most you can borrow with a buy-to-let mortgage (which is the kind you need) is typically 75% of the value of the property. In your case, that would mean the most you could increase your mortgage to would be &pound;90,000 (75% of &pound;120,000) so the most cash you could release to put down as a deposit on your new joint home would be &pound;27,000 (the difference between the increased and current mortgage amounts).</p> \n<p>However, if you were to increase your mortgage to the &pound;90,000 level, your monthly mortgage repayments would also go up. To satisfy any buy-to-let lender, the rent you are able to charge – as determined by an independent valuation – must be 125% of the mortgage payment. If you were able to borrow at a competitive rate of 3.5%, your monthly payment on an interest-only basis would be &pound;262.50 meaning that you would have to charge at least &pound;330 in rent per month. This would be the same whether you stuck to your current nine-year term or extended it. You would, however, need some way to repay the mortgage at the end.</p> \n<p>If you arranged the mortgage on a repayment basis – which is unusual for buy-to-let mortgages – you would need to charge rent of just over &pound;650 and have a mortgage term of 20 years. If you arranged a repayment mortgage over 10 years, the rent would have to be &pound;1,111 a month which is totally unrealistic given what you currently charge.</p> \n<p>Choosing to let your wife’s property isn’t really an option as her mortgage is currently greater than the maximum 75% loan typically required by buy-to-let lenders. </p> \n<p>If you chose to sell both houses, you would have &pound;77,000 in cash to put towards a new home (your equity of &pound;57,000 plus your wife’s &pound;20,000) and would need a mortgage of &pound;53,000.

Topshop has 80 “Bardot” items on sale – design director Jacqui Markham thinks the design’s popularity ties in with fashion’s obsession with the 1970s – while <a href=\"http://www.asos.com/search/bardot?hrd=1&amp;q=bardot\">a search for “Bardot” on ASOS gleans 397 results</a>. At the rarefied end of the trend, Sienna Miller wore a shoulder-showing design by Balenciaga <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2015/may/13/sienna-miller-cannes-film-festival-stylewatch\">to Cannes</a>, while Leandra Medine – of influential fashion blog Man Repeller – is a fan of Bardot designs by <a href=\"http://www.manrepeller.com/2015/05/wedding-outfit-pinterest-ideas.html\">Rosie Assoulin and Alessandra Rich</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d959603eb725a0b6ab330ce7bc1cb9f6afae7bfa\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432726456197/43261ad9-a894-4f8f-9c87-8a75c4d7a5f2-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Off Shoulder Striped Dress by Wal G, &pound;27.00, Topshop.com\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Off Shoulder Striped Dress by Wal G, &pound;27.00, Topshop.com Topshop</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Topshop</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Undeniably, the Bardot is a neckline with pitfalls – starting with your armpits. In the main part, on the high street, the trend is aimed at those who are keen to flash flesh, so many styles show more back/torso/arm than you might want to in the office. The Bardot can also look downright awkward – as if someone has yanked down your top and your arms are now trapped. Or a bit fancy-dress, as though you are recreating Sandy’s makeover moment in Grease.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d840db067745ba2a1c245d0fa2af81ae2409136\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432726324641/5a1a16a4-049d-4bad-87de-a16a66165661-339x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Grace Kelly in Rear Window 1954.\" width=\"339\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grace Kelly in Rear Window.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/Rex/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The right Bardot, however, can be easy to wear and flattering, showing off shoulders and collarbones while keeping upper arms covered – think of Grace Kelly, in Rear Window, her wide V-neck black top tucked in to full Dior New Look skirt. Close-cut Bardots <a href=\"http://www.asos.com/warehouse/warehouse-textured-bardot-top/prod/pgeproduct.aspx?iid=5114314&amp;clr=Black&amp;SearchQuery=bardot&amp;pgesize=36&amp;pge=0&amp;totalstyles=39&amp;gridsize=3&amp;gridrow=5&amp;gridcolumn=2\">such as this one from Warehouse</a> are a brilliant foil for voluminous culottes or midi skirts. Looser, frillier styles are handy, too, bringing a touch of the Carmen Mirandas to your jeans.
