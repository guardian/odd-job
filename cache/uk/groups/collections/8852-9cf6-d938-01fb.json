Our sex life is the elephant in the room</p>","byline":"Pamela Stephenson Connolly","body":"<p><strong>My boyfriend is 17, I am 19. We have been dating for five months and have sex once a week, sometimes more. It&nbsp;starts off good, but then it just never seems to end and becomes dull because he hardly ever finishes. I&nbsp;have really strong feelings for him but our sex life is like the elephant in&nbsp;the&nbsp;room. </strong></p> \n<p>All that’s missing is communication, so&nbsp;initiate a frank conversation. First, put him at ease by letting him know you have strong feelings for him, and that you particularly enjoy sex at the beginning of each lovemaking session. Then ask if he’s noticed that the erotic spark between you seems to plateau for too long, and if he can help you to figure out why. A plateau phase is actually a normal aspect of the human sexual response cycle, but in your case&nbsp;it goes on for too long. Try to work together on a solution, and be brave enough to share your individual experiences. You might say: “At a certain point, I always start feeling anxious about whether or not you’re still enjoying it. Does the same thing happen to you?” Eventually you can become more specific: “Does something distract you? I’m wondering if there’s something I could do – or not do.” Choose your words carefully, and avoid being goal-oriented about orgasm. If possible, encourage each other to ask specifically for what you need, when you need it; that is the essence of good lovemaking.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</em></p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>private.lives@theguardian.com</em></a><em> (please don’t send attachments).</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113807737/7aea6e6f-cc2e-4a30-a094-f1dfb6cc1988-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty","altText":"I have really strong feelings for him but our sex life is like the elephant in the room.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T07:00:23Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T07:00:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":56,"contributors":[{"name":"Pamela Stephenson Connolly","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/pamelastephensonconnolly"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Sex","Relationships","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/relationships","webTitle":"Relationships"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Pamela Stephenson Connolly","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/pamelastephensonconnolly"}}],"series":{"title":"Sexual healing","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/sexualhealing"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/15/i-find-sex-with-my-boyfriend-dull","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49jdc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/15/i-find-sex-with-my-boyfriend-dull","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/15/i-find-sex-with-my-boyfriend-dull"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113807737/7aea6e6f-cc2e-4a30-a094-f1dfb6cc1988-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"I have really strong feelings for him but our sex life is like the elephant in the room (posed by models).

Get one? That’s a discussion that will have been going on in the country’s living rooms during and after the first episode of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/humans\" title=\"\"><strong>Humans</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday). One meaning your own synthetic, or “synth”: a green-eyed humanoid robot.</p> \n<p>On the plus side it will clean and iron and then cook you a nice chicken chasseur for tea, freeing you up for all the good stuff you never find time for. It might even provide some kind of companionship. Plus there are potential upgrades, including adult ones, if you know what I’m saying.</p> \n<p>On the downside, there is a danger synths might make you, me, everyone redundant. They are already doing all the jobs people don’t really want to do, not just in the house, but street cleaning, handing out free newspapers, sex work etc (they are basically a bit like immigrants, I’m afraid). But it won’t be long before they’re doing the jobs you might want to do yourself – doctor, lawyer, politician, TV critic, footballer perhaps. The Singularity – when artificial intelligence overtakes human intelligence – isn’t far off. Also, returning to the basic domestic model, it might be a bit creepy having a machine that looks just like a person living in your house. It’s not good for the children either, it’ll mess with their heads. Plus you might be unlucky – like the Hawkins family – and get one, like Anita, that … who can think, and feel. Then things start to get really complicated.</p> \n<p>One of the beauties of Humans is that, like Charlie Brooker’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/black-mirror\" title=\"\">Black Mirror</a>, it really isn’t such a big leap, or ask. Only last week there was a story about Ocado creating an army of humanoids with artificial intelligence. The online supermarket robots might not be as pretty as Gemma Chan, who plays Anita (very convincing as a semi-humanoid), but this stuff is happening. Tellingly, Humans is set not some time in the future, but some time around now. It’s sci-fi for the non sci-fi fan, sci-fi that has more than a foot in sci-fact.</p> \n<p>It’s also a clever, high-energy thriller. Written – actually adapted from a Swedish series – by Spooks writers Sam Vincent and Jonathan Brackley, it has some of that show’s breathless urgency and tachycardiac pace. There are more of these sentient synths about the place, in the woods, plus urban wastelands, hiding, running. They are seen as a threat, bad dudes are after them, darting them, bundling them into vans, taking them away to be wiped clean, rebooted, decommissioned, or abused. Actually, it’s too early, and too simplistic, to divide into good and bad. There’s a more complicated, more realistic, more interesting morality to Humans.</p> \n<p>So you’re sitting on the edge of your seat, but maybe you’re also resting your chin in your hand, as you ponder technology, intelligence, consciousness, humanity, who we are and how we live now, and so on. And maybe that discussion you have should be not would you get a synth, but <em>will</em> you? Me? Are you kidding? Of course I bloody will. Mmm, chicken chasseur.</p> \n<p>Can there really be 100 Lego bricks for every child, woman and man in the world, as revealed in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-secret-world-of-lego\" title=\"\"><strong>The Secret World of Lego</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday)? Seven hundred billion bricks? By my calculations that would mean (for someone with average size feet) that approximately every other time you walked into a room bare-footed you’d step on a piece … yeah, so about right then.</p> \n<p>Head office, in the Danish village of Billund, is a secretive place where strange child-adults stick coloured bricks together, for their job. Secretive, until now; “Reputation Manager” Roar Rude Trangbaek has opened the doors and is showing us round, except for the product development area; as the camera approaches, the building’s shutters do their thing (shut).</p> \n<p>The cultishness of the company – or the fact that sugar isn’t allowed in the canteen – doesn’t put Justin off, a 23-year-old Afol (adult fan of Lego) from London from wanting to work there. Wanting to, and succeeding. The dream comes true! Of the thousands who apply, Justin is selected. And here he is, six months into the job. “It’s amazing, it’s this great family atmosphere, you feel like you’re part of something,” he says, smiling. There’s something slightly different about him, now he’s in, from before, when he was just a fan. I think Justin is lost, to Lego.</p> \n<p>Another interesting stat: in a couple of years the population of Minifigures will overtake humans … Hang on, this is beginning to feel like the other show. How long before Lego Minifigures will be able to think?</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434112822237/Not-such-a-big-leap---Gem-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Not such a big leap … Gemma Chan as 'synth' Anita with Sophie (Pixie Davies) in Humans.

The other 10 are life-like robots. </p> \n<p>It sounds like science fiction but advances in automation, robotics and artificial intelligence are revolutionising how businesses are run. And it’s not just hospitality. From manufacturing to accountancy, the rise of the robots means the days of living, breathing people <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-new-generation-of-robots-for-manufacturing-1433300884\" rel=\"nofollow\">running a production line</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-21/robots-will-know-how-to-cut-your-capital-gains-taxes\" rel=\"nofollow\">calculating your taxes</a> could be numbered. But can robots ever really be a substitute for warm-blooded workers? Or are there times when you need a human touch?<br /></p> \n<p>“The work robots are best at is rote work – anything that can be routinised and performed according to a manual and a set of instructions,” explains tech entrepreneur Richard Newton, author of The End of Nice: How to be human in a world run by robots. He adds that the speed of automation means many jobs will be swept away. </p> \n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/view/1314\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxford University study</a> published in 2013 claims almost half of all jobs will be at risk from computerisation in the future.<br /></p> \n<p>While automating the mundane, repetitive tasks involved in a factory production line or crunching data will inevitably help time-poor, cash-strapped small businesses make efficiency savings, Newton reassures us that scientists still have a long way to go before they create a machine that has the ability to be genuinely creative.<br /></p> \n<p>He says: “Robots will only do the work that can be explained to them. Increasingly the profoundly human attributes of creativity and personal connections can be simulated – from a <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/05/30/robotic-quintet-composes-and-plays-its-own-music/\" rel=\"nofollow\">robot quintet</a> which composes music to <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2014/07/10/meet-the-robots-writing-your-news-articles-the-rise-of-automated-journalism-4792284/\" rel=\"nofollow\">automated journalists</a> writing the news. But there is no personality to the work. That’s what people want when we come to creative tasks – we want that context and insight, that array of human skills, that comes from a rounded person rather than an algorithm.”<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Consumers want to know where the products have come from and who has made them.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Sophie Jewett</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Sophie Jewett, the owner of the York Cocoa House, agrees. She believes that despite the unstoppable tide of automation that has transformed the food industry, nothing can compare to the intimacy a chocolate lover feels when devouring a handmade truffle or coffee cream.<br /></p> \n<p>She started her chocolate shop, cafe and school in resistance to what she saw as a product that she has loved from childhood becoming dehumanised through the process of automation and mass production by global confectionery companies. Jewett’s plan is to return production back to the Terry’s factory in the city by opening a chocolate processing facility with a visitor centre, cafe and shop. It will be the first time the site has been used for that purpose since the company was bought by Kraft and operations moved to Europe.<br /></p> \n<p>She says automation and factory production has led to chocolates being made with cheaper ingredients and delivered so far in advance that the quality has suffered. However, she believes the tide is turning and a consumer demand for more traditionally made artisan chocolates is growing.<br /></p> \n<p>“Consumers want to know where the products have come from and who has made them. They are more discerning and interested in trying something different,” she says. “But we need to see how automation plays a role in that change.”<br /></p> \n<p>Jewett says she is not a luddite, adverse to all forms of automation, but stresses that it is important to find a balance between the quantitative and the qualitative elements of the business. If something undermines the quality of the product, that is when any form of upscaling will compromise their values. That will be the key, she says, to how the business uses automation effectively to deliver its global ambitions and vision.<br /></p> \n<p>Of course, as the hotel in Japan highlights, robotics has the potential to do more than simply perform physical tasks – it can also lend a hand in customer service. Amelia is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform created by software company IPsoft to reduce the need for human intervention in IT infrastructure management and other business processes.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The UK tends to be very cautious and people resist change unless they have to.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Grant Collier</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>This ‘mid-level knowledge worker’ can assist desks and customer service centres. Amelia can, for example, potentially take over the function of a call centre agent. But there are limitations to what it is capable of doing, however. It cannot reason and can only perform tasks that it has been ‘taught’ by a human colleague.<br /></p> \n<p>IPsoft’s European chief executive Frank Lansink predicts AI will be “one of the most significant trends of the 21st century” and believes it could replace 9% of the global workforce, helping businesses keep up with shrinking margins and increasing demand, flexibility cost and change.<br /></p> \n<p>However, what if you could create a robot that did have all the characteristics of a human and was equally creative and emotionally layered? That’s the dream of scientists developing AI and, while it might sound preposterous, the idea is plausible enough to prompt <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2014/dec/02/stephen-hawking-intel-communication-system-astrophysicist-software-predictive-text-type\">great minds such as Stephen Hawking</a> and Bill Gates to warn that this technology could “spell the end of the human race”.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/small-business-network/2015/jun/04/rise-connected-machines-intelligence\">The rise of the connected machines</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Grant Collier, an expert from the Processing and Packaging Machinery Association, claims the possibility of a robot-led doomsday is not as ridiculous as it sounds. Technology is advancing at an incredible pace and whatever the future holds, businesses large, medium and small need to join the revolution or find themselves surplus to requirement. The UK, he bemoans, is particularly slow to take advantage of automation and robotics.<br /></p> \n<p>Collier says the UK has to “wake up and do it”. He says: “The UK tends to be very cautious and people resist change unless they have to. But in the same way that computing transformed the way we worked and did business in the 1970s, we will realise that we will simply have to go down this route to survive and compete in the modern world.”<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>","section":"Guardian Small Business Network","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934797370/fcea20b2-bcb2-46f5-8195-5305317c6e08-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Xinhua/Alamy","altText":"Robot","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Xinhua/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T08:27:39Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T08:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Matthew Jenkin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/matthew-jenkin"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Guardian Small Business Network","Business","Small business","Internet of things","Internet","Technology"],"tags":[{"id":"small-business-network/small-business-network","webTitle":"Guardian Small Business Network"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/small-business","webTitle":"Small business"},{"id":"technology/internet-of-things","webTitle":"Internet of things"},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"}],"section":{"id":"small-business-network"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Matthew Jenkin","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/matthew-jenkin"}}],"series":{"title":"Connected world","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/small-business-network/series/connected-world"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"small-business-network"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/small-business-network/2015/jun/15/robot-run-business-automating-tasks","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49k7a","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/small-business-network/2015/jun/15/robot-run-business-automating-tasks","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2015/jun/15/robot-run-business-automating-tasks"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934797370/fcea20b2-bcb2-46f5-8195-5305317c6e08-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Advances in automation, robotics and artificial intelligence are revolutionising how businesses are run.

That’s what made the Tango brief stand out. Here was a client saying you can write whatever you want, just make Tango famous.</p> \n<p>My creative partner, Al Young, and I were pretty anti-advertising in our mindsets back then. Cause and effect advertising, ie you come into contact with the product and somehow it changes your life for the better, was a big trend. Bored and frustrated by the genre, the nucleus of our idea really came from a reaction to this.<br /></p> \n<p>Desperate to make a name for ourselves after spending what felt like eons trying to get into a West End agency, we knew we had to do something bold, standout and memorable to make sure we didn’t find ourselves back on the dole.<br /></p> \n<p>Coca-Cola was the big name in soft-drink advertising then. Nothing was taking on the Coke ads; nothing came close. We knew you couldn’t beat Coke at its own game. Where they had huge budget for media spend and advertising campaigns, Tango had to generate its own momentum – word of mouth was our media spend.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The actual idea started out as a joke. We said how brilliant it would be if you had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The commentators in the advert were actually from an idea we had for another ad, but we decided mash the two together (a cardinal sin in adland). We originally had American football commentators, but we were asked to make everything more British. So we got actor Hugh Dennis to do a Eddie Waring-esque commentary and contrasted that with the dry and amusing delivery of ex-footballer Ray Wilkins.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>At first, we thought the ad would have a fat orange genie who ran up and kicked the Tango drinker on the bum. Of course, the advertising authority at the time, the <a href=\"http://www.bacc.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BACC</a>, said no way. We got the script cleared by changing the kick to a pleasant, Morecambe and Wise-style slap on the face. I think it’s safe to say the little slap got a bit out of hand. </p> \n<p>We went to the park to do a test film, which basically involved us, two grown men, mucking about, “Tangoing” each other. As we messed around we realised the “little slap” just wasn’t powerful enough, so we exaggerated it. If you watch the ad, the Orange Man’s arms go way back before he slaps the person in the face.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>We even got jazz performer Gil Scott Heron, because of his deep, charismatic voice, to do the “You know you’ve been Tango’d” end-line. He was the first person to see the ad and I was shaking with fear, but he loved it.</p> \n<p>Somehow we also convinced serious up-and-coming actor Peter Geeves to play the Orange Man. We knew as soon as he auditioned – the way he ran with his stomach sticking out – that he’d be perfect. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>I first knew the ad was huge when I fell asleep on the London Underground one evening. I woke up to hear a group of kids talking about and mimicking it. I wanted to go up and say: “I did that!”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The ad continued to grow in notoriety. I remember having a conversation with a doctor who complained that kids were “Tangoing” each other at the cost of perforated ear drums. Naturally, it got banned and we had to write a new version, in which the orange man comes up and gives the Tango drinker a big kiss – far less likely to perforate the eardrum (skip to 1:20 in the video to see the ad).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"676902e036731ebae5dff792fb6629f0faf8ea52\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434108571450/7adf79cb-d8b7-4a46-9d88-cf0a85974933-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Orange Man from the Tango ad\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Geeves played the ad’s Orange Man.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quiet Storm</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the time advertising tended to be very slick, beautifully-scripted and with big budgets, so a lot of the industry didn’t like our ad. One of the big advertising professionals called it “oik advertising”. But we loved that. We were a combination of a very talented Scotsman, Al and me, helped along by some very talented creative directors. We knew we were brave enough to do stuff that nobody else would do, or think about doing. I think that’s what made the ad what it is. Now, years later, that’s what makes my own agency what it is.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>You can say “Tango ad” to people and they still remember it. Some even dress up as the Orange Man today. That, for me, is what makes a piece of work great – when the general public take it on, play with it and it becomes theirs.<br /></p> \n<h2>Ad facts</h2> \n<p><strong>Who:</strong> Trevor Robinson OBE (art director), Al Young (copywriter), Jon Leach (planner), Axle Chaldecott and Steve Henry (creative directors) and Matt Forrest (director)<br tabindex=\"-1\" /><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Companies Involved:</strong> <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://advertising.about.com/od/international/p/Howell-Henry-Chaldecott-Lury-And-Partners.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury</a> (advertising agency) and Limelight (production company)<br tabindex=\"-1\" /><strong tabindex=\"-1\">Length of the project:</strong> two to three months (including research)</p> \n<p><em>Trevor Robinson OBE is executive creative director and founder of <a href=\"http://quietstorm.co.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Quiet Storm</a></em><br /></p> \n<p><strong><em>To get weekly news analysis, job alerts and event notifications direct to your inbox, </em></strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/media/\"><strong><em>sign up free for Media Network membership</em></strong></a><strong><em>.</em></strong></p> \n<p><em>All Guardian Media Network content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled ‘Advertisement feature’ – find out more </em><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sponsored-content\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>","section":"Media Network","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434107717354/3dd015bd-abc8-425c-ade3-1d2ceb6f1765-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Quiet Storm","altText":"Orange Man Tango ad form the 90s ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Quiet Storm"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434108572130/5878bcd6-8fc9-4fc6-a50d-3281a9e016c4-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Peter Geeves played the ad’s Orange Man.
