It’s late at night, and I’m standing in a hotel lobby, waiting for a lift to take me up to my room. In front of the lift there is a framed sign on a stand. My name is printed on the sign, above an arrow pointing to the stairs. Below that are some words in Spanish. From the context, it seems obvious to me that the sign says, “Tim Dowling is barred from the lift.” But I’m alone in the lobby, so when the door opens, I&nbsp;get in.</p> \n<p>In the morning, after breakfast, I ring my wife.</p> \n<p>“I was wondering when I might hear from you,” she says.</p> \n<p>“They took me out,” I say. “Sorry.”</p> \n<p>“What happens today?” she says.</p> \n<p>“Press conference,” I say. “Rueda de prensa. There’s a sign.”</p> \n<p>“Who comes to that?” she says.</p> \n<p>“I don’t know,” I say.</p> \n<p>When I try to put myself in the position of a Spanish reporter invited to put questions to a foreign journalist I’ve never heard of whose book has just been translated into Spanish, I can only imagine balling up the press release and throwing&nbsp;it away.</p> \n<p>Before the press conference, a hired photographer takes pictures of me in various locations: next to a wall; perched on a chair near a plant; on the pavement outside. I am, as always, eerily compliant.</p> \n<p>Afterwards, I follow the arrow on the sign with my name on it up the stairs. At the top there are 40 people milling about wearing name tags on lanyards, drinking coffee and eating free pastries. I find the woman from the publisher’s publicity department standing to one side.</p> \n<p>“Are all these people here for me?” I ask.</p> \n<p>Her eyes search the crowd as she processes my&nbsp;question into Spanish. “No,” she says. “They’re doctors.”</p> \n<p>About eight journalists have turned up for my&nbsp;press conference, which is taking place in a&nbsp;room off the mezzanine where the doctors are.&nbsp;Because&nbsp;I don’t speak any Spanish, an interpreter has been provided. She’s called Janine, and is seated at my right hand with a&nbsp;notepad. When the publisher begins his opening&nbsp;remarks, Janine immediately leans towards me and starts whispering in English. This&nbsp;is a little alarming – two people either side&nbsp;of&nbsp;me, speaking simultaneously. My concentration skips from one voice to the other.&nbsp;Then the talking stops, and everyone looks&nbsp;at me.</p> \n<p>“Buenas dias,” I say.</p> \n<p>I turn to Janine. “Is that right?” I whisper. Janine makes a face. Uh-oh, I think. Don’t piss off&nbsp;Janine.</p> \n<p>A journalist to my left asks a long question. “He&nbsp;is comparing your wife to the Guardia Civil,” Janine whispers. I can’t tell whether what she subsequently says about the Guardia’s&nbsp;historic reputation for brutality is part of the question or just a bit of background for my&nbsp;benefit.</p> \n<p>When everybody looks at me again, I begin talking in English. I make a joke that is greeted by&nbsp;complete silence. I glance towards Janine and&nbsp;I&nbsp;see that she is doodling – her pad is full of stick figures, letters and squiggles. Later, I will learn this is an abstract form of shorthand commonly used by interpreters, but at that moment I’m convinced she’s playing hangman to&nbsp;pass the time. Janine’s bored, I think.</p> \n<p>Eventually, I run out of breath. Janine starts speaking in rapid Spanish, crossing out stick figures as she goes. At one point, some of the journalists chuckle, but I can’t tell if they’re laughing at me or with me. Perhaps Janine has made a joke at my expense, I think. It occurs to me that I might find it easier to go outside and impersonate a doctor.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434447626267/Tim-Dowling-col-illo-2061-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration:  Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","credit":"/Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling col illo 20/6/15","cleanCaption":"Illustration:  Photograph: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434447804128/9f94492b-6664-49b6-8033-f314a6ccb316-686x720.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":686,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian Photograph: Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","credit":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","altText":"Tim Dowling illo June 20","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian","cleanCredit":"Illustration: Benoit Jacques for the Guardian"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T04:59:06Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T04:59:06Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":26,"contributors":[{"name":"Tim Dowling","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733750190/TimDowling.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/timdowling"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Life and style","Books","Culture","Spain"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"travel/spain","webTitle":"Spain"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tim Dowling","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/timdowling"}}],"series":{"title":"Tim Dowling's Weekend column","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/timdowlingsweekendcolumn"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/tim-dowling-book-launch-spain","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49npe","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/tim-dowling-book-launch-spain","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/tim-dowling-book-launch-spain"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":5,"byline":{"title":"Tim Dowling"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"cutout","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733750190/TimDowling.png"}}]},{"title":"2UNDR Gear Shift / Pants with a sack for your balls when exercising","rawTitle":"Pants with a sack for your balls when exercising","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/is-it-worth-it-2undr-gearshift-stuart-heritage","title":"Is it worth it? 2UNDR Gear Shift","trailText":"‘Basically, they’re a long pair of pants with a little sack to tuck your balls into when you exercise’","standFirst":"<p>‘Basically, they’re a long pair of pants with a little sack to tuck your balls into when you exercise’</p>","byline":"Stuart Heritage","body":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf7254b177416c8a08b6e884cbea8f15568db13f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434375135563/3388cae0-c0cd-493d-990b-5baa44eb344a-297x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Is It worth it? 2UNDR gear shift\" width=\"297\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>What is it? </strong>A pair of pants.

In their pants.</p> \n<p><strong>How much does it cost? </strong>&pound;24.99.</p> \n<p><strong>What does it promise?</strong> Right, first let me apologise for the barrage of nightmarish mental images you’re about to be assaulted with. The official line is that the <a href=\"http://www.2undr.eu/shop/gear-shift.html\">Gear Shift</a> is for “those who compete like an Olympian on the field, a boss in the boardroom, and Don Juan in the bedroom”. Basically, they’re a long pair of pants with a little sack to tuck your balls into when you exercise.</p> \n<p><strong>What’s it actually like?</strong> It’s desperately clear that I don’t perform like any of those things in any of those places. But I am a chronic sufferer of chub rub, the stingy rash you get on your thighs when they chafe together in high temperatures. It can be debilitating, especially during long runs. So far, these pants have banished my chub rub almost completely. The little sack – officially called a Joey Pouch (I’m sorry) – sweeps up your privates, keeping them safe from unwanted skin contact. In addition, there’s also something called a No-Drip-Tip (I’m so sorry) that wicks away sweat. The result is that you quickly forget you’re wearing them, which is generally a good thing where pants are concerned.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst bit </strong>The best bit is the fact that they work. Being able to run in comfort on a hot day is a rare experience for me, and these are helping enormously. The worst bit is having to read all the durr-brained, over-masculine marketing copy about them.</p> \n<p><strong>Is it worth it? </strong>Sure, if you suffer from chub rub and have a high tolerance of infuriating branding.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434374996626/Is-it-worth-it-2undr-gear-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration: Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian","credit":"/Son of Alan for the Guardian","altText":"Is it worth it 2undr gear shift","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434375136123/67248119-74b4-4268-af16-d95d54199f1c-424x600.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":600,"width":424,"orientation":"portrait","credit":"Illustration: Son of Alan for the Guardian","altText":"Is It worth it? 2UNDR gear shift","cleanCredit":"Illustration: Son of Alan for the Guardian"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-20T05:00:08Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T05:00:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":16,"contributors":[{"name":"Stuart Heritage","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749780/StuartHeritage.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stuart-heritage"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Health & wellbeing","Life and style","Fitness"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fitness","webTitle":"Fitness"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stuart Heritage","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stuart-heritage"}}],"series":{"title":"Is it worth it?","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/is-it-worth-it"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/is-it-worth-it-2undr-gearshift-stuart-heritage","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ep7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/is-it-worth-it-2undr-gearshift-stuart-heritage","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/20/is-it-worth-it-2undr-gearshift-stuart-heritage"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"2UNDR Gear Shift"},"byline":{"title":"Stuart Heritage"},"showQuotedHeadline":true,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434374996626/Is-it-worth-it-2undr-gear-010.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration: Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian","credit":"/Son of Alan for the Guardian","altText":"Is it worth it 2undr gear shift","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Photograph: Son of Alan for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"Sali Hughes on beauty / Barely there mascara","rawTitle":"Barely there mascara","item":{"type":"article","id":"fashion/2015/jun/20/barely-there-mascara-sali-hughes-makeup","title":"Beauty: barely there mascara","trailText":"‘I have never&nbsp;been drawn to the idea of an understated mascara, but that doesn’t mean I’m not willing to give them a chance’","standFirst":"‘I have never&nbsp;been drawn to the idea of an understated mascara, but that doesn’t mean I’m not willing to give them a chance’","byline":"sali Hughes","body":"<p>As someone in possession&nbsp;of short, poker-straight eyelashes, I must confess that I have never&nbsp;been drawn to the idea of an understated mascara (other than when I was at school and pretending to wear none).

There is one ATM and no cars – yellow golf buggies taxi people around. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0714484bd358d598f40ed01c404f10b9369d165\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434637233504/22a57050-06b0-4c40-98e6-2e22d61910c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A pelican on Isla Holbox, where wildlife is a major draw for tourists.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A pelican on Isla Holbox, where wildlife is a major draw.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Alongside rudimentary campsites, a string of boutique accommodation options include <a href=\"http://www.hotelholboxisland.com/\"><strong>Posada Mawimbi</strong></a>, with whitewashed cabanas, oversize beds and organic toiletries. Neighbouring hotel <a href=\"http://www.holboxcasalastortugas.com/\"><strong>Casa Las Tortugas</strong></a> recently added an upmarket eco-spa and yoga studio and has plans for an artists’ residency programme and onsite patisserie. </p> \n<p>Luis Olmos, creative director at boutique hotel <a href=\"http://www.villasflamingos.com/\"><strong>Hotel Villa Flamingos</strong></a>, says development has been slow and steady, catering to “a steady stream of discerning newly weds, young families and backpackers brought here via travel blogs or word of mouth”, but notes that a new motorway through the Yucat&aacute;n has shortened journey times from Playa Del Carmen and Cancun, and attracted daytrippers.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82cc20da32035dd8ec2d7fe04df951c461115719\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434637460641/217d5d9a-2bdd-472c-9d60-0aa2357104b3-460x299.jpeg\" alt=\"A whale shark feeds off Isla Holbox.\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A whale shark feeding off Isla Holbox.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Design Pics Inc/REX/Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Among the best spots to eat are thatched <strong>Isla del Colibri</strong> on the square, serving potent frozen margaritas and coconut prawns; seafront <strong>Mandarina</strong> does sushi and cocktails in Elle Decor-esque surrounds (as close as you’ll come to the Tulum scene); and food truck <strong>El Changarrito and Cariocas</strong> is good for alfresco lobster pizza.</p> \n<p>A developing art scene is another draw. The <a href=\"http://www.ipaffestival.com/\">International Public Arts festival</a> in April saw 20 artists transform the island, and their colourful murals remain. The festival will return next April. And while there is as yet no gallery, local artist Rigel Sauri is cited as one to watch – and his artwork can be seen at restaurants including <strong>Viva Zapata!</strong></p> \n<p>Wildlife tourism is a major attraction, with the May-September high season coinciding with the annual congregation of rare whale sharks, and an influx of flamingos, best spotted by kayak. The <strong>Holbox Yum Balam ecological reserve </strong>seeks to protect all species on the island, including four types of nesting turtle and a sea swallow that nests in the sand.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d31439e57f0c7af00a0e1780162f8387e389c45\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434637632222/29f2cbfc-8582-4e52-a6a1-3e7af67bfd55-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Murals at the Tribu hostel, Isla Holbox\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Murals at the Tribu hostel</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/apr/08/riviera-del-sur-cantina-mexico-city-nicholas-gilman\">Nicholas Gilman on Riviera del Sur, Mexico City</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Just off shore in the mangrove-lined north, fledging animal conservation project <strong>Crocodile Quay</strong> is being built. Kayak trips pause here to see the crocodiles, turtles and helmet crabs already being monitored. A restaurant, small education centre and museum are part of its long-term plan.</p> \n<p>But while this is all fantastic for the tourists, some local residents fear that Holbox could go the same way as Tulum. Last year locals fought off proposals for a large-scale hotel development and a petition calling for the government to publish a management plan for the reserve is currently gathering signatures. Whether Holbox can expand its tourist industry without attracting the attention of powerful property developers remains to be seen. For now though, life ticks along at a deliciously slow pace. </p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636662918/5966578c-a5d9-4271-826e-d81b38aa7f73-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Posada Mawimbi resort on Isla Holbox","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434637235510/22a57050-06b0-4c40-98e6-2e22d61910c7-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A pelican on Isla Holbox, where wildlife is a major draw.
