murdered undercover cop into brilliant drama","byline":"Sam Wollaston","body":"<p>Sheridan Smith! Everyone’s favourite actor, doing her mascara in the morning. Well, pretty much my favourite actor anyway – after her performances as Lisa Lynch, and Cilla, and Mrs Biggs. Now she’s in <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/presscentre/ep1week26/black-work\" title=\"\"><strong>Black Work</strong></a> (ITV, Sunday).</p> \n<p>An admirably quickly put together drama about the Rachel Dolezal affair, and the mascara is the final touch to a longer, more controversial process? You (I) wish. When that does happen though, I think Smith would make an excellent Dolezal, with both the acting talent and the parentage for it. No, here she’s a copper, PC Jo Gillespie, in an unspecified Yorkshire city. Domestically, she’s just about still married to Ryan, another police officer, who is … oh, sadly, dead. He’s been shot through the chest at a disused warehouse (where else?).</p> \n<p>It turns out Jo hardly knew him. He wasn’t going up to London every week to train CID officers, or even playing football when he said he was; he has been undercover for three years, on the case of a gang of seriously bad dudes. That – undercover police work – is the Black Work of the title. He was also bugging his own wife – not as in annoying her a bit, but covertly recording Jo, in the car. So he knew about the affair she wasn’t quite having, with another policeman. They certainly like to stick together, keep it in the family, these coppers.</p> \n<p>You would think, given his line of work, that Ryan would have hidden the CDs of the bugged recordings in a better place than the airing cupboard, where his little girl Melly can – and does – find them. It’s not just the CDs, there’s a camera too, looking out, for us at home, so we can see any time anyone opens it up. It’s an odd trick, a variation of the camera in the fridge; who do these directors think we – the viewers – are? Towels? Ham?</p> \n<p>There are a few things that don’t ring quite true about Black Work. Jo being expected to keep Ryan’s murder from the kids (try to act like your husband, their dad, hasn’t just been killed will you love, it’ll help with the investigation); the way the content of the CDs is made public (noooo, don’t put it on the living room hi-fi so the whole family can listen to mum’s imminent infidelity … oops, too late); the entire police force going to the pub, at lunch time; the way the local newspaper operates (very unjournalistically).</p> \n<p>Of course drama is allowed a little licence, and it would matter less if it – the drama – was brilliant. It’s not, though. It’s certainly not bad either. As a thriller, it’s pacy, tight and intriguing; I’ll be tuning in next weekend because I want to know what Jo uncovers, now that she has taken on the job of finding out what happened to her husband herself (and I want to know who else opens the airing cupboard door, obviously).</p> \n<p>What it isn’t, though, is Line of Duty, which has raised the bar for British cop drama. It doesn’t have that stomach-cramping tension. Nor is it also an examination of a complex workplace, full of very real, three-dimensional characters. This is less intelligent, less interesting, more ITV. And even Sheridan Smith can’t help that. She’s good – of course she is, she’s Sheridan Smith, she could breathe humanity into a stick. But she’s only as good as what she’s got to work with, and this isn’t going to be one of those OMG did-you-see performances. The next Bafta will have to wait, until Black Face maybe … or not.</p> \n<p>And so to the Baftas of roofed garden structures: <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/amazing-spaces-shed-of-the-year\" title=\"\"><strong>Amazing Spaces Shed of the Year</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Channel 4, Sunday). Starting with the “normal shed” category. Boo, boring, if I wanted normal I’d go out to my own … Oh, but actually not so boring. Because the first “normal shed” has a train set in it; more like an entire rail network in fact, with accompanying cities, countryside, infrastructure, population etc. Then, my favourite, the “shedservatory”, which slides apart, giving the powerful telescope inside an uninterrupted view of the night sky (is Buckinghamshire really dark enough though?). Then – still in the normal category – there’s a cinema shed, and Cormac in his floating shed. There are two Cormacs in the show, interestingly: it’s a very popular name among “sheddies”.</p> \n<p>If these are normal then I don’t know what it makes mine (Flymo, secateurs, string, inflatable girlfriend … No! Joking! It’s a Qualcast!). It’s all making me feel very dull anyway. Also relatively sane. And a teeny bit patriotic – there’s something very British about this lunacy.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434723817136/Could-breathe-humanity-in-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Could breathe humanity into a stick … Sheridan Smith as PC Jo Gillespie in Black Work.

So should you throw away your stilettos – or is there a compromise?","byline":"Luisa Dillner","body":"<p>I have one pair of high heels, and they hurt. The pain is mostly in my feet because they are forced into an unnaturally extended position with my toes bunched upwards and heel sticking up. My lower back isn’t too happy either. But who cares? I’ve joined the 78% of women who wear them almost daily, despite them causing pain, on average, after one hour and six minutes. High heels are perceived to be worth the pain because they make legs look taller, feet smaller and the body thinner. But research published this month from <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Feu.wiley.com%2FWileyCDA%2FPressRelease%2FpressReleaseId-118514.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFRuRYy6q6ZFypxFCfS-dQR2p5DSg\" title=\"\">South Korea in the International Journal of Clinical Practice</a> suggests that high heels may actually alter the muscle balance around the ankle joint, leading to instability and balance problems.

High heels push the centre of gravity forwards and upwards so you have to constantly change your posture to keep your balance.</p> \n<p>Professor Neil Cronin of the University of Jyvaskyla in Finland, author of a <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2Fpubmed%2F22241055&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE9EuwvriHDdYYtqc2UlS-MMrXsUA\" title=\"\"> review of the long-term effects of high heels</a>, warns that they increase the changes in length that a muscle goes through when you walk. Usually that change is small. But wear high heels and it is larger, and the strain goes more through the tendon joining the muscle to the bone, as it usually does. The Achilles tendon at the heel can shorten and get stiff. Cronin says women who wear heels for years develop such chronically short muscles and tendons that when they try to wear flat shoes again their calves hurt. Studies have also suggested high heels increase the risk of arthritis, but it’s difficult to prove. So should you stick to flats?</p> \n<h2><strong>The solution</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>It’s hardly news that you can fall over in high heels but the evidence of ankle instability suggests some care is needed. Cronin advises thicker heels (wedges anyone?) as they help balance, and keeping heels to 4cm or below. Wearing soft insoles can reduce pressure on your knees. You should alternate with flats (Cronin advises limiting high heels to two to three days a week) take them off if you sit at work and do stretching exercises for your feet and calves (for example, pick up a pencil from the floor with your toes). Or not walk in them at all.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434720143455/What-damage-are-high-heel-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"What damage are high heels doing to your feet?

Just out of the centre, in N&oslash;rrebro, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/mar/04/jakob-fenger-copenhagen-superflex-superkilen-norrebro\">Superkilen park</a> is a vibrant example of how exciting free play areas can be – with multicoloured areas to reflect the multicultural neighbourhood, sloped walls, ramps, a climbing octopus and art installations for hiding on/in/around.</p> \n<h2>Uncover art and design <br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f2ef0f26bf749369c59bcaa59d0736bbbe0df8cc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434718108232/de949e2b-d4c1-4d75-b434-ec27f555022b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Exhibition at The Danish Museum, Copenhagen\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exhibition at The Danish Museum of Art and Design</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Great Scandinavian design is everywhere in the city but to really geek out over mid-century Danish design, the collection of Jacobsen and Klint furniture at the <a href=\"http://designmuseum.dk/en\">Danish Museum of Art and Design</a> (also a research library) is worth seeing.

They are liars and thieves’ – Gatcombe </h2> \n<p>Our penultimate episode opened with a most tender scene, that of Eddie Marsan’s Gilbert Norrell regarding the “work of beauty” penned by his pupil Jonathan Strange, a single tear rolling down his cheek in front of the fire at Hanover Square. Once again, Marsan showed his understated prowess. The moment of brotherhood did not last, however, as Norrell proceeded to make the whole lot disappear, including those copies at John Murray’s publishing house, much to the consternation of Murray himself (an underused John Sessions) and poor, voiceless Mr Tantony, who’d once more travelled down from Nottinghamshire with Mr Gatcombe only to be royally buggered about again by magicians. My advice? Stick to brewing, sirs.</p> \n<h2>‘He says these things bring death … madness’ – Flora Greysteel </h2> \n<p>Now holed up in Venice, and driven to extreme measures by the “death” of Arabella, Strange encounted the Greysteels (Flora, a poetry groupie and erstwhile chum of Byron, played by Lucinda Dryzek, and her father James, played by Game of Thrones’ Clive Mantle) as he was barking at a shopkeeper about procuring materials to make him mad. As luck would have it, they knew the maddest old bird-eating broad in town. Back to that in a moment.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f96e6c8be9e3f31e8cb622592b1b46a6b2fe61f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434711487407/3dc35791-c23c-4365-87a4-d9a3bd744b79-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Flora Greysteels Flora (Lucinda Dryzek) and Strange (Bertie Carvel).\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flora Greysteels Flora (Lucinda Dryzek) and Strange (Bertie Carvel).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC/JSMN Ltd/Matt Squire</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>‘Mr Drawlight, I can conjure terrors, sir, of which your mind cannot conceive. Find Mr Strange and stay with Mr Strange’ – Norrell </h2> \n<p>Who better to stick his sticky beak into Strange’s beeswax than the tragic Drawlight, that gossiping fishwife in regency clothing. Being released from chokey, having all his debts paid plus an all-expenses trip to Venice seemed a bloody good deal to me, regardless of the danger posed by reporting back to Lascelles and Norrell with word of Strange’s dabblings with dark, Uskglassian magic. He delivered another memorable line too, when discussing which 19th century goofballs Strange might or might not be hopped up on.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Drawlight: “He takes certain powders and preparations.”</p> \n <p>Norrell: “Of what kind?”</p> \n <p>Drawlight: “Oh, they are all of the fashion. Amongst the poets. The kind of thing to provoke visions of palaces in Xanadu or Christ stuck up a tree. And suchlike.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Marvellous.</p> \n<h2>‘I have a proposal for you, madam. I am able to give you your heart’s desire. And in return, you shall give me mine … I want you to teach me how to be mad’ – Strange</h2> \n<p> No one had ever been so happy to see a barking old cat lady as Strange, transforming crazy old Mrs Delgado into a feral feline in return for the rodent equivalent of liquid LSD. Luckily, his magic mouse juice proved just the ticket, allowing him to not only summon but converse, finally, with Thistledown, much to the Gentleman’s chagrin, though their initial chat was fairly cordial. Their contretemps – first at Strange’s squalid Venetian garret and then the more climactic clash at Lost Hope – when Strange finally realised that Arabella was quite alive and quite enchanted, was fearsome stuff, as the Gentleman encased his enemy in darkness. See below my musings on “magic hands”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"873e4689705226b1f97857b26d1f85c01278cc54\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434711638999/64a7d7ce-ad6a-495b-98f6-ba991bdc7afb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Strange finds Arabella.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Strange finds Arabella.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC/JSMN Ltd/Matt Squire</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>‘Let’s go for a stroll ... and find my tree’ – Vinculus </h2> \n<p>This week’s episode was perhaps as much concerned with the predicament of Stephen Black as about the imprisonment of Strange in his inky plume. Finally – finally! – spurred into action, his mutinous road trip with Vinculus saw him grow a pair, a pair that Lady Pole had grown some weeks ago. I stand by my point last week, that despite his own enchantment, he saw fit to do nothing but the Gentleman’s bidding and appeared cowardly because of it, while Lady Pole secretly did her best to try and wriggle free – albeit futilely – from the siren song of Lost Hope. Their exchange at the water was bold and brilliant.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Vinculus: “I was born with this just like you were born with that. Our meaning is written on our skin, nameless slave.”</p> \n <p>Stephen: “Indeed. My skin means that any man may strike me in a public place and never fear the consequence. It means that no matter how many books I read, how many languages I master, no matter how diligently I work, I will never be anything but a curiosity. It means I am nothing.”</p> \n <p>Vinculus: “My skin means the opposite of yours. My skin means you will be raised up on high, nameless slave … that your enemies shall be destroyed … it means that the time has almost come.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Vinculus’s hanging was a cruel, empty death – if prefixed by some solid putdowns by the Gentleman – but one suspects that this is not the end of the vagabond magician.</p> \n<h2>‘I am opening the door. I am returning magic to England’ – Strange </h2> \n<p>Drawlight’s assignation, meanwhile, would likely have had him praying for his wretched cell. It was a fine scene, and delightfully menacing, as Strange positioned himself for the endgame, unleashing that Batman-esque unkindness of ravens (yes, that is the thoroughly glorious collective noun) which smashed into Hanover Square. He is coming.</p> \n<p>I’m going to throw it out there – best episode so far. It was tough to fault, though it also sets the bar perilously high for the finale next week. Remember, there isn’t a second book, so when this is gone, it’s gone.</p> \n<h2>Other matters of note </h2> \n<p><strong>Magic Hands </strong>Much like jazz hands, there is extensive use of “magic hands” in JSAMN (as I’ve only now decided to acronym it, with just one episode to go. Think of the time we could have saved). One can’t help thinking you must feel a right tool doing “magic hands” in front of all manner of grips and gaffers on set, before all the special effects are added in several months later. Got to be hard to style that out.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e3330a62d105dd2c6dceef2567cc8b5e2284bd5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434711809421/946c6fc9-0ef9-49ce-92bf-048459cdd88b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Magic hands…\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Magic hands…</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Squire/BBC/JSMN Ltd/Matt Squire</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Vinculus Chic </strong>It struck me like a hammer blow when Paul Kaye’s Vinculus stripped off by the water’s edge with Stephen Black that with his sleeve tats, daft hat (he gets “hat of the week”, by the way) and straggly beard, that he’s just a bloody Dalston hipster. Someone get this man a vintage Italian unicycle and some part-time work as a barista/social media consultant and the circle is complete. Expect Vinculus chic to sweep east London forthwith.</p> \n<p><strong>Gun in the Face of the Week </strong>First episode in, and James Greysteel nails it during a witheringly simple exchange with Drawlight, who displayed all the charm of a frothing gossip columnist as he and Flora exited Strange’s Black Tower.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Drawlight: “What have you heard?

Etsy – the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sustainable-business/2015/jun/18/etsy-ipo-etsyorg-foundation-business-finance-spirituality\" title=\"\">online marketplace for goods</a> handmade by people among whom the proportion of talent to enthusiasm varies to an almost dizzying degree – has recently <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/18/etsy-ban-metaphysical-services\" title=\"\">revised its selling regulations and outlawed all magical</a> (or to use the handmade spelling preferred by its vendors, magickal) goods. Spells, hexes, curses – “any metaphysical service that promises it will effect a&nbsp;physical change (eg weight loss) or other outcome (eg love, revenge) is not&nbsp;allowed.”</p> \n<p>Previously such sales were allowed, as long as they were accompanied by a tangible item (a candle, perhaps, or a crocheted dreamcatcher, or an embossed tin token to improve the efficacy of your mumbo-jumbo). This was presumably for complicated legal reasons that, one suspects, ultimately boil down to allowing the site to escape accusations of perpetrating – or perpetuating, depending on where you like to draw the line – fraud.</p> \n<p>Naturally, many witches, warlocks and other woo-woo vendors are exercised by <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/lifestyle/etsy-witchcraft-ban/\" title=\"\">the religious discrimination they feel is being practised</a>. Why, for example, should St Christopher’s medals and other blessed trinkets still be allowed for sale when they also offer less-than-tangible protections to the wearer? Are not all imaginary friends and influences created equal in the eyes of God/triple goddesses/no one at all?</p> \n<p>The more cynical among us wonder how much the influence of mammon is at play. Because a&nbsp;quick sprint around the internet reveals that there is big money in spell-selling. There is a witch or witch-type-effect person ready to supply followers’/customers’/marks’ every romantic, financial or retributive need at a wide variety of price points. I’m currently debating whether to purge all the negative forces from my life via a reverse curse, double hexer or jinxbuster for $39.95 (each, plus a repeat casting two hours later for an additional $9, natch. Y –you can’t be too careful). It seems like a&nbsp;steal compared to some other sites. I&nbsp;found one that charges 10 times that – that’s $400 for those of you too busy to whip up a Calculation Charm – for a&nbsp;Light and Dark Goddess Love Spell. Though to be fair, the witch in question does promise to cast it during the festival of Beltane, which should make all the difference.</p> \n<p>Not for the first time, I begin to suspect that I am in the wrong job. There are sites that offer free spells (I am tempted by an Emergency Teleportation one, but unfortunately under “You will need the following items for this spell”, it says: “Fear for one’s life” and “Power Object”, neither of which I&nbsp;have) but overall the impression is of nice little magickal yncomes easily – possibly very, very easily – earned, all of which I&nbsp;presume are fully accounted for in the backs of the relevant grimoires. Izzy-whizzy – let’s all get busy.</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434725984845/1939-THE-WIZARD-OF-OZ-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"MGM/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar","altText":"Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-21T17:15:13Z","lastModified":"2015-06-21T23:10:15Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":21,"contributors":[{"name":"Lucy Mangan","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733743116/LucyMangan.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/lucymangan"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Online shopping","Consumer affairs","Technology"],"tags":[{"id":"money/online-shopping","webTitle":"Online shopping"},{"id":"money/consumer-affairs","webTitle":"Consumer affairs"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"}],"section":{"id":"money"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Lucy Mangan","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/lucymangan"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"money"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/shortcuts/2015/jun/21/etsy-casts-out-vendors-magickal-merchandise","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ax9v","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/money/shortcuts/2015/jun/21/etsy-casts-out-vendors-magickal-merchandise","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2015/jun/21/etsy-casts-out-vendors-magickal-merchandise"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434725984845/1939-THE-WIZARD-OF-OZ-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Etsy’s done what?’ Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch of the West in The Wizard of Oz.
