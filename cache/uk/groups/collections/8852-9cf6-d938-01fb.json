For months, people have been preaching to me about this. “So, it’s a blender?” I ask. “Nooooo. A nutrition extractor. It makes the vitamins in pulp and seeds bioavailable,” they howl, which makes me think someone is filling the damn things with Kool-Aid. They are the conversational mainstay of fitness bores, who see food as fuel and wish meals came in pill form. <br /></p> \n<p>See, a “Nutriblast” is 50% greens, 50% whole fruits, plus a “boost” of seeds, nuts, matcha powder, unicorn shavings, whatever, all blitzed into an on-the-go meal replacement. Which means losing texture, colour and individuated flavours. I managed to turn a gorgeous heap of kale, strawberries, blueberries and nectarine into something that looked like I’d dragged a sieve through the Thames. And it’s infantilising. Declaring that you live off smoothies is like begging someone to take away your vote. </p> \n<p>And yet … a week later, I’m still using it. Why? It’s one of the most convenient kitchen gadgets ever created. The vertical design is sleek, with a small footprint and solid build quality. It has precisely zero buttons. Washing up is extraordinarily minimal: mixing containers double as drinking cups, so run the screw-off blade under the tap and you’re done. </p> \n<p>I start to tailor my ingredients, swapping water for almond milk, or adding mango, kiwi, and topping up with frozen berries, which are more affordable and refreshing. A sprig of mint for lift, and it’s a perfect summer refresher. Plus, a morning Nutriblast feels like finishing homework on Friday night: having got my five-a-day all at once, who’s to say I can’t just eat lollies for the rest of the day (apart from every nutritionist on the planet)? </p> \n<p>A blender this useful is too good to be co-opted by the spirulina snorters. Here’s what Nutri-dullards aren’t telling you – it’s not for healthy people. It’s for incredibly lazy people. I’ll drink to that, any day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ae23d0e36a67ca2dd175f5cb9112d17bfb48917\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435756159782/e85318de-5143-402e-a960-2488beca2e99-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Rhik necks his Nutriblast\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rhik necks his Nutriblast.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Any downside?</strong></h2> \n<p>Even cyclonic extraction blades can’t make that price tag any more digestible.</p> \n<h2>Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard?</h2> \n<p>Counter.

She’s not the only one whose archive is incomplete</p>","byline":"Chitra Ramaswamy","body":"<p>Amy Winehouse may be under scrutiny again with the release of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/16/amy-review-asif-kapadias-amy-winehouse-film-is-a-tragic-masterpiece\" title=\"\">Asif Kapadia’s Amy</a> but at least there is&nbsp;one aspect of her short and relentlessly contested life that will for ever remain untouched. Her demos. Those earliest, unpolished, often unlistenable artists’ recordings that are resurrected into the stuff of nightmarish posthumous albums. In the runup to Friday’s release of the documentary on the singer, the boss of Winehouse’s label has&nbsp;announced that he personally destroyed the singer’s demos to ensure they would never see the light of day.</p> \n<p>It wouldn’t be the first pre-emptive strike on an artist’s oeuvre. Literature is full of pages thrown on the fire. Jane Austen’s elder sister, <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v17/n15/terry-castle/sister-sister\" title=\"\">Cassandra, famously burned huge quantities of the author’s letters</a> to her, and snipped entire sentences out of others. The sisters, who remained unmarried, lived together all their adult lives. It was Cassandra to whom Jane wrote most often. And it was Cassandra who felt she had the right to act as her sister’s final censor. Many Austenites will never forgive her for it.</p> \n<p>The motivation for destroying an artist’s work is often shadowy, and always riven with questions of ownership. Perhaps the most incendiary example is Ted Hughes, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2010/oct/10/ted-hughes-last-letter-sylvia-plath\" title=\"\">who claimed he burned Sylvia Plath’s journal</a> covering the last few months before her suicide because “I just didn’t want her children to see it, no. Particularly her last days.” Feminists and critics saw it as a supreme act of&nbsp;male control, in the same way that they viewed his selection, ordering, and editing of the poems in Plath’s greatest collection, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/childrens-books-site/2014/dec/03/review-sylvia-plath-ariel\" title=\"\">Ariel</a>, as censorship.</p> \n<p>Sometimes artists wreck their own work. JD Salinger ceased offering his words for publication two years after The Catcher in the Rye came out. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/theguardian/1998/dec/30/features11.g23\" title=\"\">Nearly 50 years of silence ensued</a> in which he watched reruns of I Love Lucy, ate raw food, and wrote only for himself, frequently ripping out the pages of notebooks he carried everywhere and burning them. For Claude Monet, it was a toxic combination of poor eyesight, depression, and perfectionism that led him to <a href=\"http://flavorwire.com/395275/10-artists-who-destroyed-their-own-work/2\" title=\"\">shred 30 of his paintings before they were set to&nbsp;be exhibited in 1908</a>. His wife, Alice, bemoaned the impressionist master’s chronic self-doubt in a letter: “He punctures canvases every day, it is truly distressing … the way he treats the result of eight years’ work is most unfair!” Thankfully, Monet didn’t completely trash the series. Among the ones that got away were his Water Lilies paintings, among the greatest impressionist works in history.</p> \n<p>What happens when the destruction doesn’t happen but, well, perhaps should have done? For Tupac Shakur, the US rapper who was shot in 1996, it has meant a level of prolific output surely no artist would choose. Basically, more albums have been released under his name since he died than when he was alive. When Michael Jackson’s posthumous album, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2010/dec/09/michael-jackson-michael-cd-review\" title=\"\">Michael</a>, came out 18 months after his death, his family claimed that he wasn’t even singing on some of the tracks.</p> \n<p>And then there’s Franz Kafka, whose work, against all the odds, survived. The author burned an estimated 90% of his writings during his lifetime. When he died, in 1924, a letter addressed to&nbsp;his friend Max Brod was found in his desk bearing a single instruction: “Everything I leave behind me … to be burned unread.” Did Brod respect his friend’s last wishes? Did he, hell. A year later The Trial came out, followed by The Castle, then Amerika. Did Brod do the right thing? Does the extraordinarily high quality of the work, so rare in posthumous releases, mitigate his act of betrayal? The debate goes on.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/247ce3dfe599a37de501f113cda7e996d34dc67e/0_65_3000_1802/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1802,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Danny Martindale/WireImage","altText":"Amy Winehouse, whose demos will never see the light of day.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Danny Martindale/WireImage"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T17:44:26Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T23:00:53Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":122,"contributors":[{"name":"Chitra Ramaswamy","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/chitra-ramaswamy"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Amy Winehouse","Music","JD Salinger","Books","Sylvia Plath","Ted Hughes"],"tags":[{"id":"music/amywinehouse","webTitle":"Amy Winehouse"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"books/jdsalinger","webTitle":"JD Salinger"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"books/sylviaplath","webTitle":"Sylvia Plath"},{"id":"books/tedhughes","webTitle":"Ted Hughes"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Chitra Ramaswamy","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/chitra-ramaswamy"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/shortcuts/2015/jul/01/amy-winehouse-jane-austen-kafka-monet-works-destroyed","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aaex","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/shortcuts/2015/jul/01/amy-winehouse-jane-austen-kafka-monet-works-destroyed","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2015/jul/01/amy-winehouse-jane-austen-kafka-monet-works-destroyed"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/247ce3dfe599a37de501f113cda7e996d34dc67e/0_65_3000_1802/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1802,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Amy Winehouse, whose demos will never see the light of day.

It’s enough to stop me going back</p>","byline":"Maddie York","body":"<p>There was a moment on Thursday at Glastonbury – my first time at the festival – when it seemed as though everyone was destroying everything. I hadn’t prepared myself for people dropping their rubbish and walking away from it; or peeing on the land, which ruins the river and kills the fish and wildlife; or leaving their mess on the toilet seats without a thought for the next person. I had naively expected a wonderland of cooperation and conservation. Disillusioned, after less than a day, I kind of hated the entire crowd. I wanted to go home.</p> \n<p> My unfazed boyfriend – this was his 10th Glastonbury – pulled me out of the gloom, encouraging me to see that it’s a minority of festival-goers who behave this way. He said that, while baffling numbers will abandon their camping gear when they leave, there were also thousands cleaning up after themselves, using the 40,000 bins around the site. This calmed me down. I had another beer. As we sat by the Park stage, I looked around and tried to see beyond the cups and plates of half-eaten food all over the grass and notice that people were mostly respecting their surroundings. Most were abiding by the rule of the farm: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/green-glastonbury/take-it-dont-leave-it/\">leave no trace</a>. </p> \n<p>Still, throughout the weekend, as I tried to get lost in the music, I found it hard to get past my anger about those who litter. There are workers appointed to clear this up, they think – and anyway, the bins are overflowing, my hands are full. That’s just how it is at festivals.</p> \n<p>I coped better than I expected with the bits of Glastonbury I thought I’d struggle with. The mud, the tent getting hot, the long drops, the Fall. None of these, though tough to endure, were really enough to stop me going back. But the littering was, and that surprised me.</p> \n<p>As the 800-strong litter-picking crew begin the mammoth task of clearing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3142856/As-year-s-Glastonbury-closes-big-clean-begins.html\">an estimated</a> 1,650 tonnes of waste – including 5,000 abandoned tents, 6,500 sleeping bags, 400 gazebos, 54 tonnes of cans and plastic bottles, 41 tonnes of cardboard, 66 tonnes of scrap metal, 3,500 airbeds, 2,200 chairs and 950 rolled mats – it has crossed my mind that I could return as part of their team. I’d get some satisfaction from mitigating the ingratitude of people who don’t give a damn about keeping the farm clean for each other and the wildlife. I’d still be angry, though: the rubbish gets cleared up but the people don’t learn. It’s probably best I just stay away.</p> \n<p>“Everyone’s so lovely, I love it here,” gushed a man next to me as we waited for breakfast hotdogs at the Popdogs stand on Sunday. Many have this loved-up feeling by the end of the festival, but I didn’t. There are enough people behaving badly to make me suspicious of the whole crowd. The few who enjoy themselves thoughtlessly, going against the green Glastonbury <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.glastonburyfestivals.co.uk/information/green-glastonbury/\">ethos</a>, spoil it for the many.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435746613365/b668d5ba-04f4-49a7-b8c8-1ee39cf00971-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"DYLAN MARTINEZ/REUTERS","altText":"A reveller walks through rubbish left in front of the Pyramid Stage as they leave Worthy Farm in Somerset after the Glastonbury Festival in Britain, June 29, 2015.

He is also vice-president of the Association of Authors’ Agents. But becoming an agent wasn’t part of his original career plan and he reached this point via a varied and winding path through the world of books.</p> \n<p>Wise studied History and English at Edinburgh university, both, he says, “heavy reading” subjects. But his real introduction to books as business came when, as an undergraduate, he won a place on a scholarship programme at the University of Pennsylvania. “I was allowed to work under my visa and I got a part-time job as a bookseller at Barnes &amp; Noble, which had a big downtown bookstore,” he says. The job gave him an insight into publishing and sparked a vocation that would lead him to his current career. “What I enjoyed about publishing was that it is the place where business and creativity meet; you would be working with these wonderfully creative people – the writers – but trying to turn what they have created into something of commercial value.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If you are made an offer straight away, ask for a better offer. If you don't ask, you will never know</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Gordon Wise</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In the bookshop he saw one part of the process. “It was fascinating to see the psychology of people buying books, and the serendipitous leads that would take people from one thing to another,” he says. “If I had to reshelve sections after the lunch break, it was always the true crime and romance sections that had been picked over the most. So I began to realise the power of genre literature.” </p> \n<p>At the same time, he was learning more about the inner workings of the publishing machine. “I had to do something called the hot list, where Barnes &amp; Noble had a commitment to publishers to promote certain books, putting them in the front of the shop. So I would stock those books on a weekly basis to see what the rate of sales was, and I began to recognise certain publishers’ names and the sorts of books they were trying to promote, the ones where they would try to move high volumes in a short period of time rather than ticking over on the back list.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c53b3f3d77c52e10c74c233e9b909eee5f05fde\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435761396238/61c1e474-5b5e-4d42-9986-3d735bb43e6c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'If I had to reshelve sections, it was always the true crime and romance sections that had been picked over most.

He also wanted to return to the States so he applied for a visa through the Work America scheme, and went back to Philadelphia, where he worked at the Borders bookstore. “I covered for everyone’s holidays, so I did a week in each department over the summer.”</p> \n<p>At the end of his contract, he heard about a job with a Kodansha, a Japanese publisher that had a position to fill in its New York offices, through a contact. He worked there as an international consultant for three years, and after the first year was promoted to a role where he commissioned books.</p> \n<p>When he returned to the UK, it was time to find a new job as a publisher. He had built up helpful contacts while in the US, and got in touch with as many people as he could. “I wrote to an awful lot of people and I met a lot of people, often deluding myself that I was having a job interview but actually there wasn’t a job to give. Looking back, it’s quite funny: you realise you have to hustle. You can’t just sit there waiting for things to happen to you.”</p> \n<p>He found a job with a company called Boxtree, an independent publisher specialising in film- and TV-related books. It was bought by Macmillan in 1996, and Wise began working more on non-fiction and celebrity books. He later returned to the more serious and literary side of things by overseeing the John Murray list at Hachette. </p> \n<p>Everything changed when the companywas restructured. Wise decided to set up his own consultancy: “The idea was that I would do some editorial work, some ghost-writing, some developing of ideas for people who had intellectual property, but didn’t know how to turn them into a book. But I didn’t really enjoy working for myself very much; I was a bit lonely.” So when a job opportunity arose at Curtis Brown three months later, Wise went for it. </p> \n<p>He now represents a varied group of authors and his job is to ensure that they find the right publisher and that everything is done to sell their books. “The shy and retiring type isn’t going to thrive in an agents’ environment,” says Wise. “It is about selling and about attracting people’s attention. There is a certain amount of blagging – not uttering untruths, but you are employed by your authors to talk up their work, so you have to have relentlessly positive line on things.” </p> \n<p>Agents are paid through a commission-based system, typically earning 15% of any advance or royalties. “But you can’t tailor the amount of time you spend on things according to the advance, your obligation is to do the right thing by the author.”</p> \n<p>Another key skill for a literary agent is time management. </p> \n<p> Works in progress might include reading early material and making suggestions to the author, submitting completed work and negotiating a deal with the publisher, perhaps playing two or three against each other to get the best deal, and negotiating a contract, all for different authors with very different books.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/small-business-network/2014/mar/18/small-publishers-changes-industry-digital-technology\">Small publishers are benefiting from changes in the industry</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Good negotiation skills are crucial. “If you are made an offer straight away, ask for a better offer. If you don’t ask, you will never know whether that was possible or not.” </p> \n<p>Anyone considering pursuing a career as an agent needs to show a real commitment to industry, says Wise. “I always want to work with someone who has a proven interest in the business of books – it is up to them to see how they define that. You want pretty clear evidence that someone has an idea how to work in an office and how publishing structures work.” </p> \n<p>Building up that experience might include volunteering at literary festivals, finding work in a bookshop and perhaps considering internships with publishers and agencies. .</p> \n<p>Importantly, though, “you have to be business-minded,” says Wise. “You can’t just be thinking that publishing is this thing where you lie on a chaise all day and read. It’s all about getting books into other people’s hands so that they can do that.”</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435760587346/1366096c-a3da-4121-9a0d-68026816c302-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":" Public domain/Public domain","altText":"Gordon Wise, literary agent","cleanCredit":"Photograph:  Public domain/Public domain"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435761397736/61c1e474-5b5e-4d42-9986-3d735bb43e6c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘If I had to reshelve sections, it was always the true crime and romance sections that had been picked over most.

The ornate arrangements of Annie Clark’s early works may have reflected her state of mind and certainly her environment; she is one of eight siblings from a large Catholic family from the suburbs of Dallas, and it was from within this familial tumult that she began her internalised musical explorations, always with the aid of digital software. “I’ve been recording on computer-based systems since I was 13,” she told Pitchfork in 2008. “My songwriting process is sort of inextricably integrated with technology.” Despite the modernity, Clark somehow pulls a baroque pop gem out of nowhere with Paris is Burning, a song as effulgent as the belle &eacute;poque itself, with a cascading waltz outro . Named after the 1990 documentary about New York drag queens, the song may have been written – or at least started – in Paris itself, which Clark passed through at various times playing with both Sufjan Stevens and the Polyphonic Spree. Footage exists of her <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x35rzk_st-vincent-paris-is-burning-a-take_music\">performing the song somewhat tentatively with just an acoustic guitar outside Le Trianon </a>in Pigalle in September 2007, when someone at La Blogotheque convinced her it would be a good idea. The raven-locked, gamine former hair model in the clip is a world away from the strident, shock-haired androgyne that stormed to pole position in so many end-of-year album polls in 2014. </p> \n<h2>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZW9NYX6JZA\">Actor Out of Work</a></h2> \n<p>St Vincent’s second album Actor marked her first musical partnership with producer John Congleton, a fruitful relationship that has seen them work together on all subsequent St Vincent albums, including Love This Giant with David Byrne. Actor Out of Work is a fine example of this chemistry, a runaway juggernaut of a song that gathers momentum as it rolls down the hill. Set against all this frantic energy is Clark’s amiable delivery, which so often disguises a mischievous wink, or belies the lyrical sting in the tail. The video for the song captures this duality, as she sits in a casting role like some demure Marina Abramović, inexplicably reducing the poor thesps across from her to tears just by looking at them. The first of a number of films made with <a href=\"http://parkpictures.com/terri-timely\">Ian Kibbey and Corey Creasey</a>, it not only introduces us to the smiling assassin, but also alerts us to a somewhat tenebrous sense of humour. Interestingly it was the promo for Actor out of Work that first made Byrne aware of St Vincent. “When I met Annie I complimented her on how disturbing her video was,” he said in an interview when the pair were promoting Love This Giant. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AZW9NYX6JZA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZW9NYX6JZA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9prpAv6kvo\">Marrow</a></h2> \n<p>Having toured the world extensively both as session musician and as a solo artist, St Vincent’s alt-rock credentials were already well-established when Actor came out in 2009, but it’s her meanderings outside of the indie heartland that make her such a compelling artist. Marrow is perhaps the first successful transplant, a crossover alternative narrative with a pulsating dance heart. As well as producing, Congleton programmes the drum sequences, and on Marrow the conflation of the bass-drum kick with the pounding throb of the bass is arresting beyond compare, at least up to that point. Working with a loose concept, Clark based each song on Actor on scenes from a movie, with Marrow channelling the moment Dorothy meets the Wizard. “I felt like I wanted to create something that was Technicolor, was visual as much as musical,” Clark said. “And also lyrically – this person wishing they had a spine made of iron – it’s sort of along the thematic lines of The Wizard of Oz.” <br /></p> \n<h2>4. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Itt0rALeHE8\">Cruel</a></h2> \n<p>For her third album Clark upped sticks to Seattle to write and record, an isolating experience that did wonders for her productivity. She also dispensed with the computer for the first time during the writing process, making for a more coherent and less cluttered listening experience. On Strange Mercy she seems to be railing against the conformity of contemporary America throughout. “When I was young, coach called me the tiger,” Clark reminisces on Year of the Tiger, while on Cheerleader she claims to have “seen America with no clothes on”, and doesn’t “want to be a cheerleader no more”. Cruel appears to be a hate letter to domesticity once one has left high school, and with its lyrics about expectations placed on “bodies”, it might even be a call to arms to tie up the Fallopian tubes. It marches almost militarily, as a ghostly, gossamery refrain wafts over it almost ignoring the moving structure below; perhaps it represents the disconnect of fulfilling one’s duty whilst inhabiting the dreamlike reality of a life on Prozac. The anguished cry of “cruel” in the choruses further exemplifies this feeling of domiciliary entrapment. Where complicated ideas abounded previously, now she was taking them and making them look easy. </p> \n<h2>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjZgiv2F1QY\">Surgeon</a></h2> \n<p>What do St Vincent and Robbie Williams have in common? Not a lot, although both created songs based around Nancy Sinatra’s James Bond theme You Only Live Twice. Where Williams took the sample and looped it on Millennium, Annie Clark goes some place completely different, culminating in a wild pitch-bending Bobby Sparks solo that calls to mind a crazy s&eacute;ance where all the gods of funk are dragged into the same room at once. Another spirit called upon is Marilyn Monroe, whose diary entry prompted the slightly modified refrain: “best finest surgeon / come cut me open”. The isolation theme with the help of Monroe – the celebrated, tragic femme fatale and poster girl for the tortured soul – is perhaps best explored on this sublime track. Clark, for the first time, presents an overtly sexual persona on Strange Mercy, while there’s always an underlying narrative of depression if you dare to delve deeper. With the line “I spent the summer on my back,” she somehow manages to cleverly combine the two.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"St Vincent\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:331MHk8zXyXondHm7WVvhV\" width=\"460\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OecM1x7iVPU\">Lusitania (with Andrew Bird)</a></h2> \n<p>Some of St Vincent’s best moments have been collaborative. These include a soon to be released track with the Chemical Brothers, a recent 16-minute rendition of Drill with post-punk heroes Wire in Chicago, and most famously as Kurt Cobain’s stand-in when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2014/apr/11/nirvana-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-collaborations-lorde-joan-jett-st-vincent-kim-gordon\">Nirvana</a> were recently inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Perhaps less edgy than any of these, though more gorgeous, is her alt-country duet with Andrew Bird, on his 2012 Break It Yourself album. Bird says the song actually took him up to three years to write after the line, “you’re the one who sunk my Lusitania” popped into his head. Collaborating with Clark was the easy part. “I’ve known Annie for years,” said Bird, “so I asked her to sing because the second verse felt like it was a different point of view. She gets the more upbeat point of view. It felt like static electricity between two people.” Indeed, the blending of the two voices is heavenly. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yROppYcAKfA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yROppYcAKfA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hpPYKJAnwUo\">Who (with David Byrne)</a></h2> \n<p>The other St Vincent alliance of note is the one with David Byrne. Byrne – having worked with everyone from Brian Eno to Marisa Monte – is no stranger to the collaboration himself, though when the pairing was announced it still caused a flutter. It made sense of course: both are residents of New York, both were art school dropouts, and both have a penchant for fearless avant garde experimentation but within the parameters of commercial pop music. They worked within boundaries, this time writing all parts solely for brass, with Congleton adding percussion after the tracks were laid down. Most successful is lead track Who, a dogged funk track with both parties imprinting their distinctive personalities without it turning into a push-me-pull-you power struggle. Love This Giant thrived because of the total commitment entered into by both parties – Byrne and Clark quickly dispensed with any notions of “side-project” and toured the record together for a whole year after it was finished. </p> \n<h2>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAdARF4rGcQ\">Birth in Reverse</a></h2> \n<p>When Annie Clark released promotional pictures of herself for her fourth solo record, fans were surprised to see her with a towering white coiffure. The look suggested an alien alter-ego, yet the eponymous title suggested unshakable self confidence and an awareness that whatever St Vincent is had been fully distilled into the new record, with everything that came before mere preprandial hors d’oeuvres. The live shows were a revelation too, featuring Clark in dazzling blue eyeshadow like a Warhol screenprint animated, with stunning choreographed routines between her and her onstage foil, bassist Toko Yasuda. Her desire to make people dance and “blur the boundaries between a rock show and the theatre” had been fully realised, especially on Birth in Reverse. The critics were in a froth, though the opening line of the track seemed to cause disproportionate consternation. “Oh what an ordinary day,” she sang, “take out the garbage, masturbate.” The rest of the song, for what it’s worth, is brilliant. </p> \n<h2>9. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVAxUMuhz98\">Digital Witness</a></h2> \n<p>If a teenage Clark had embraced technology so wholeheartedly, then the adult Clark appeared to be recoiling from it. Though neither preachy nor prescriptive, Digital Witness sees her observing the practices of social media, the confessionals and the frequent status updates, in puzzlement and wonder. “If I can’t show it, if you can’t see me,” she sings, “What’s the point of doing anything?” It’s less judgmental than it is empathetic, though you sense the intensely private singer is bothered that people give so much of themselves away in the internet age. Musically it’s one of the finest moments of her career, harking back to Paisley Park-era Prince, but with a delectable groove that sounds like the future. Certainly any comparisons with the Purple One are not inappropriate or outlandish – this is after all an artist who can stand shoulder to shoulder with David Byrne. St Vincent shows, like Prince shows are astonishing, the difference being that she is the one making the relevant and revelatory records in the present.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmnhY9Smj3M\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VmnhY9Smj3M?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nr_Y6eSOGUA\">Prince Johnny</a></h2> \n<p>St Vincent the album features several narratives based on true stories, including the time she took off all her clothes and attempted to convene with nature, only to be chased away by a serpent (Rattlesnake). The other notable true story is Prince Johnny, about a New York drag queen friend whom she evidently tried to snort a piece of the Berlin Wall with. It’s an ambient and luxurious ballad, affectionate and gorgeously melodious. “Prince Johnny, you’re kind, but do be careful,” she sings with an air of caution, and you detect tragedy is never far away, and might well be waiting around the corner. During live sets of the song, Clark would hand her guitar to someone, then lay prostrate across the stage like Thomas Chatterton, the doomed teenage poet. Or maybe the sacrificial pose was symbolic of the purging of religious guilt, a renaissance Christ complete with bleeding heart sewn into the breast of her costume. Whatever the meaning, St Vincent certainly seems freed from the shackles of conventionality, a boon for the rest of us, as her oeuvre is as inventive and curious and intriguing as that of anyone else working today. </p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4f4e69323ffcf0a3cdd56b4e9c2cd1b8deeb6a3c/0_135_3848_2310/3848.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2310,"width":3848,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"MediaPunch/REX/MediaPunch/REX","altText":"St. Vincent in concert at Terminal 5, New York City, America - 26 Feb 2014<br>Mandatory Credit: Photo by MediaPunch/REX (3604074g)\n St Vincent\n St. Vincent in concert at Terminal 5, New York City, America - 26 Feb 2014\n ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: MediaPunch/REX/MediaPunch/REX"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-01T14:48:37Z","lastModified":"2015-07-01T14:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":25,"contributors":[{"name":"Jeremy Allen","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jeremy-allen"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["St Vincent","Music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/st-vincent","webTitle":"St Vincent"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jeremy Allen","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jeremy-allen"}}],"series":{"title":"10 of the best","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/series/10-of-the-best"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2015/jul/01/st-vincent-10-of-the-best","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aa6v","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/musicblog/2015/jul/01/st-vincent-10-of-the-best","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/jul/01/st-vincent-10-of-the-best"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4f4e69323ffcf0a3cdd56b4e9c2cd1b8deeb6a3c/0_135_3848_2310/3848.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2310,"width":3848,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"St Vincent … It’s art. no it’s pop. no it’s art, no it’s pop.
