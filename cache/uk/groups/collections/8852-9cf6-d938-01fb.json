In <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/running-with-the-pack-2.html\">his book on the subject</a><em>,</em> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/mar/04/whats-the-point-in-running\">Mark Rowlands</a> complains that most books about running reframe this question in terms of what use it has. We run because it keeps us healthy, reduces stress or brings us joy. We run for the satisfaction of a personal best or for the thrill of the race. We run to meet new people, to be part of a team or to impress the opposite sex. All of us will at some point have explained our pastime in such terms. But Rowlands argues that running, at its best, is valuable for what it is in itself, not for what it gives us. In other words, we run just because. And this is an idea that comes naturally to the novelist.<br /></p> \n<p>When the reform-school boy in Alan Sillitoe’s The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner throws away a race against a rival school, he does so not only to deny glory to the institution he detests, but because to win – even to finish – would be to undermine what he’s come to learn is the true value of running. “You had to run, run, run, without knowing why you were running,” he says. “This feeling was the only honesty and realness there was in the world.” For once, he’s doing something that is not done for the sake of something or someone else. </p> \n<p>The following five novels are recommended as portraits of a runner’s life, as well as for being forceful reminders that running, at its best, is something we do for its own sake. </p> \n<h2><p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Running-A-Novel-Jean-Echenoz/dp/1595584730\"><strong>Running</strong><strong> </strong></a><strong><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Running-A-Novel-Jean-Echenoz/dp/1595584730\">by Jean Echenoz</a> (translated. by Linda Coverdale)</strong><br /></p></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c4Z8cbcIiA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3c4Z8cbcIiA?wmode=opaque\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Emil Zatopek on his way to triple glory\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jean Echenoz’s fictionalised biography of the “Czech Locomotive” Emil Z&aacute;topek tells of his transformation from an unenthusiastic, uncompetitive child into the “superhuman” athlete who <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3c4Z8cbcIiA\">won the 5,000m, 10,000m and the marathon at the Helsinki Olympics</a> of 1952. There is enough training-based detail here to please the club runner: Echenoz doesn’t ignore Z&aacute;topek the maverick, “ignoring every time-honoured rule” to pioneer the interval session or to “invent” the sprint finish. But this is a historically engaged novel about how sport can become entangled with politics; a story driven by the tension between individual freedom and political constraint. Echenoz does a brilliant job of picturing an athlete whose activities and public persona were constantly influenced by outside forces – from the unassuming child who is forced into cross country by Nazi occupiers in Zl&iacute;n to the showboating “athlete of the state”. The most convincing of these is not the Bolt-like athlete who couldn’t lose – “living proof of the wonders of socialism” – but the man who, at the end of his career,<em> </em>is still running, even while confronting the prospect of irreversible decline.<br /></p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/running-the-rift.html\"><strong>Running the Rift </strong><strong>by Naomi Benaron</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xW8c5re3akM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xW8c5re3akM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Naomi Benaron reads from Running the Rift.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Set in Rwanda, Naomi Benaron’s Running the Rift is another novel whose narrative is propelled by a clash between athletics and politics. It follows Jean-Patrick, a promising young Tutsi runner who, growing up, seems destined for the Olympics. Amid the political instability of the early 1990s, Jean-Patrick’s talent and determination allow him to “barter a future with his legs and his sweat and his pain”. But, as it did for Z&aacute;topek, success threatens to come only at the cost of losing his identity. As the conflict between Hutus and Tutsis escalates, running is made difficult by the curfews, road blocks and patrols, and Jean-Patrick comes to appreciate the true importance of putting one foot in front of the other (“Only when he ran ... could he sort out these problems that went round and round in his head”). Running is no longer a way of life, but a luxury. Soon after, it becomes a necessity: when the genocide strikes, Jean-Patrick finds himself, quite literally, bartering a future with his legs, his sweat and his pain.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/other-3.html\"><strong>The Other</strong><strong> </strong><strong>by David Guterson</strong></a></h2> \n<p>Guterson’s novel begins with a brilliantly perceptive account of a half-mile race: “approximately two minutes of self-mortification and private crucifixion”. Few who’ve had the misfortune of running an 800m race would disagree with this. Nor are they likely to question the narrator’s description of the 800m runner: “They want to do battle with suffering. It’s the trauma they want, the anguished ordeal.” It is fitting that a novel about masochism taken to an extreme should begin with an 800m race. In The Other, running – and the pain that accompanies it – is an important means of escape: from child abuse, from romantic rejection, from the pressure to fit in, but above all from the “hamburger world” of late capitalism. Guterson’s novel shows how our need for ritual suffering must be contained. The alternative, played out in the narrative of The Other, is a literal escape from civilisation – an austere life in the woods even less appealing than an 800m race.</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/brewster-2.html\"><strong>Brewster </strong><strong>by Mark Slouka</strong></a></h2> \n<p>Does it matter? This is a question that haunts Jon Mosher, the high-school athlete at the centre of Mark Slouka’s coming-of-age novel set in the US in the late 1960s. With everything going on – alongside the personal crises that drive the book’s narrative, the Vietnam draft is a constant and frightening presence – Jon can be forgiven for questioning the importance of running. However, intoxicated by numbers, split times and the thrill of the race, he remains willing to put himself through any kind of torture to remain in the team. Slouka’s descriptions of high-school track races are unrivalled in their resonance and beauty; these passages capture everything from “the air thick with heat rub” to the deadly elegance of the elite runner, progressing through the field “like a scythe going through grass – gorgeous, ruthless”. Slouka does a brilliant job of making the reader understand Jon’s decision to stick at it. In Brewster, running is not so much about catharsis and escape, but about creating valuable shared experiences and memories. “For those three minutes and 20 seconds,” Jon says after victory in the mile relay, “it felt like it mattered.”</p> \n<h2><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Once-Runner-John-Jr-Parker/dp/1416597891\"><strong>Once a Runner</strong><strong> </strong><strong>by John L Parker Jr</strong></a></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7QFjd-oUec\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7QFjd-oUec?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>In 1978, having failed to find a publisher for Once a Runner, John L Parker Jr began selling the book at road races from the boot of his car. It quickly became a favourite among those club runners lucky enough to get their hands on a copy. Now widely available, Once a Runner should be prescribed to any runner who trains hard – or who <em>thinks </em>they do. Quenton Cassidy is a damagingly committed miler whose success comes at the cost of permanent fatigue, crumbling relationships and a lifestyle similar to that of a cloistered monk. In the book’s most memorable passage, he completes a brutal session of 60 x 400m reps. Parker Jr’s prose is convincing enough to leave the reader feeling inadequate yet strangely motivated. But Once a Runner<em> </em>gives fair warning to anyone looking to dive into a training routine like Cassidy’s. At a party towards the end of the novel, he has a moment of self-revelation that will resonate with anyone who has trained for an endurance event: “It occurred to him that he was a pretty dull guy.” So, why do it? Cassidy admits he has no adequate response to this, but there’s something in the breathless energy and enthusiasm of Once a Runner that points to the answer: we do it just because.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434548937388/9d9f5a2e-41f3-4235-b095-d6575cf69dc8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images","altText":"Emil Zátopek in 1947 after a successful five-mile cross-country race.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Popperfoto/Popperfoto/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T07:07:57Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T07:12:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Books","Life and style","Running","Athletics"],"tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/running","webTitle":"Running"},{"id":"sport/athletics","webTitle":"Athletics"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/18/five-novels-every-runner-should-read","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49mm7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/18/five-novels-every-runner-should-read","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/18/five-novels-every-runner-should-read"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434548937388/9d9f5a2e-41f3-4235-b095-d6575cf69dc8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Emil Zátopek in 1947 after a successful five-mile cross-country race.

And 2015 has been an exceptional year, with numbers not thought to have been seen since early in the 19th century.</p> \n<p>According to the latest figures, Somerset is the top UK county for bitterns, despite the species only becoming re-established in in the region seven years ago.

But he added: “The European Union is consulting on the future of the birds and habitats directives. And we <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/joinandhelp/campaignwithus/defendnature/\">fear this may lead to a weakening of the directives</a>, with potentially disastrous consequences for many threatened species.”<br /></p> \n<p>Simon Wotton, a conservation scientist with the RSPB, said: “In the late 1990s, the bittern was heading towards a second extinction in the UK, largely because its preferred habitat – wet reedbed – was drying out and required intensive management, restoration and habitat recreations. But thanks to the efforts to improve the habitat, combined with significant funding from two projects under the<a href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/environment/life/\"> European Union Life</a> programme, the bittern was saved, and we’re delighted that its success keeps going from strength to strength.”<br /></p> \n<p>Of key sites contributing to the recovery, Ham Wall, which was created from old peat workings, saw the bittern first nest in 2008, with 17 boomers recorded this year.

So, assuming the UK Treasury has simply adapted those same numbers, based on them, the <a href=\"http://fullfact.org/sites/fullfact.org/files/SPspending_Data_20140116.xlsx\">UK’s social protection spending is 7.4% of the world’s total</a>, according to World Bank data.</p> \n<h2>Is that the whole story? </h2> \n<p>As FullFact notes, the “world total” in the World Bank report is comprised of 96 countries, and does not include several large economies, such as Canada and Mexico (where <a href=\"https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=SOCX_AGG\">social expenditure accounts for about 17% and 8% of each country’s GDP</a>).</p> \n<p>It is therefore likely that a true world total would lower Britain’s proportion – albeit not enough to make Osborne’s claim false – and probably explains the chancellor’s rounding down to 7%.</p> \n<p>It is also worth noting that the UK’s global share is in line with comparable economies, such as Germany (12.56% of world total), France (9.92%) and Italy (6.84%). Even as a percentage of GDP, <a href=\"http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/11/27/2053392/welfare-spending-across-the-oecd/\">Britain’s social spending is on a par with the OECD average</a> and other advanced economies.</p> \n<p>A second area of possible confusion when looking at all this is how welfare spending is actually defined, and then compared between countries.</p> \n<p>Total <a href=\"http://unstats.un.org/unsd/cr/registry/regcst.asp?Cl=4&amp;Lg=1\">social protection spending</a> (which is the definition used in the World Bank report) in the UK amounts to about &pound;250bn a year (36% of its public spending), <a href=\"https://fullfact.org/economy/welfare_budget_public_spending-29886\">according to FullFact</a>. It includes what is paid out in benefits, pensions and tax credits, but also the cost to administer all these and the cost of personal social services, such as social care for the elderly.</p> \n<p>A narrower definition of welfare, say, the amount paid out for benefits and pensions, amounts to &pound;183bn (26% of public spending).

They then analysed whether the patient’s death rate was impacted by being admitted to a different hospital than where they underwent surgery. </p> \n<p>Using a complex statistical model believed by some economists to bring the large data set closer to the ideal – a randomised study – researchers analysed claims between January 2001 to November 2011. Medicare is the US government health plan that covers adults older than 65, and is the largest health insurer in the country. </p> \n<p>The study, “Readmission destination and risk of mortality after major surgery: an observational cohort study,” was published in the UK medical journal the Lancet on Wednesday. </p> \n<p>At its core, the study focuses on “continuity of care” – the concept that patients may have better outcomes when they are able to see the same doctor throughout treatment. The data was culled from patients who underwent 12 complex surgeries from five disciplines, such as total hip replacements and partial removal of the oesophagus. </p> \n<p>One physician involved in the study said researchers began the year-long data analysis after they hypothesised that a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/08/13/business/A-Wave-of-Hospital-Mergers.html?_r=0\">push to regionalise hospitals</a> had an effect on that continuity. In other words, as some hospitals successfully specialised in complex procedures patients traveled longer distances to undergo elective surgeries there, but returned at differing rates if complications arose. </p> \n<p>The doctors’ concerns about postoperative care were well founded, as some studies have shown that as many as one in four surgical patients will need to be readmitted to the hospital following a complex surgery. </p> \n<p>The study, doctors said, provides data to backup to some of the more anecdotal concerns they have when patients are readmitted to different hospitals. A hospital that originally performed a surgery could have more personal knowledge of patients or of the procedure, one doctor argued. </p> \n<p>“Those doctors [at different hospitals] are not going to know all the things that went on in that previous hospitalisation,” said Dr Benjamin Brooke, a surgeon at the University of Utah School of Medicine and a primary author of the study. </p> \n<p>Or, more practically, said Dr Justice Dimick of the University of Michigan Health System, some hospitals simply may not have the experience to manage complications of complex, seldom-performed surgeries. </p> \n<p>“It’s this issue of: do they have the know-how, the tacit knowledge? Its not in textbooks, it’s clinical intuition.

The amendment will require Scottish ministers to consult on the shape of the new powers over the summer.</p> \n<p>One possible, far-reaching option ministers could consider would be to give fans groups the legal right to put in a bid even if the club is not up for sale – a power already in force in Scotland for tenants of rural estates. </p> \n<p>“The principle of a fans’ right to buy is overwhelmingly popular and parliament is doing the right thing by backing it,” Johnstone said.</p> \n<p>“Many Scottish clubs are well-run, but everyone can name others which have been forced into administration, or worse. With this right, never again would fans be left watching on the touchline as their club goes bust. </p> \n<p>“This is a system that works well elsewhere, in places like Germany, Spain and Argentina, all countries which do rather better than Scotland at both a club and national level.”</p> \n<p>Paul Goodwin, one of the most influential figures in the fans buy-out campaign, said the new measures would make a significant difference in the Scottish game. Many clubs were now financially very vulnerable but could suddenly change hands without notice, or find themselves unable to find new owners.</p> \n<p>Goodwin, a marketing expert helped the Nationwide Building Society run its sponsorship of England’s football leagues for ten years, said at present fans were only allowed to make offers at the last moment after conventional options to sell a club had been exhausted. </p> \n<p>A new <a href=\"http://scottishfsa.org/\">Scottish Football Supporters Association</a> had recently been set up, chaired by former Labour first minister Henry McLeish, to help fans’ groups form registered and properly constituted “community interest companies” which would be able to make formal bids.</p> \n<p>He helped fans buy Stirling Albion, one of six Scottish clubs now wholly owned by their fans or being slowly bought by fans trusts, from its 83-year-old owner, in 2011. “It was literally a day before the club was going to go under because it had no assets,” he said. </p> \n<p>Fans at Heart of Midlothian in Edinburgh, the largest Scottish club to be saved by its supporters, are now slowly paying off a &pound;2.5m loan from businesswoman Ann Budge, who put in her own money to save it from closure. About 8,500 supporters are contributing &pound;15.50 a month each to pay her loan off over three years, to eventually give Foundation of Hearts sole ownership.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434568747806/97c3585e-b68d-422d-9f4c-82208e4c79a9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graham Stuart/PA Archive/Press Association Ima","altText":"General view of Forthbank stadium, home of Stirling Albion","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graham Stuart/PA Archive/Press Association Ima"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T19:23:37Z","lastModified":"2015-06-17T23:50:11Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":52,"contributors":[{"name":"Severin Carrell","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/severincarrell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Football","Scotland","Scottish politics","UK news","Politics","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland"},{"id":"politics/scotland","webTitle":"Scottish politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Severin Carrell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/severincarrell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/scottish-football-fans-given-legal-right-to-buy-their-clubs","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49qfh","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/17/scottish-football-fans-given-legal-right-to-buy-their-clubs","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/17/scottish-football-fans-given-legal-right-to-buy-their-clubs"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434568747806/97c3585e-b68d-422d-9f4c-82208e4c79a9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"General view of Forthbank stadium, home of Stirling Albion, which was saved from closure by fans.
