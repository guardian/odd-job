But why, asks Rachel Roberts, who is stripped, tortured and killed by the singer in the video, is it considered any worse than Tarantino?</p>","byline":"Morwenna Ferrier","body":"<p>Last week, Rihanna released a seven-minute video for her single Bitch Better Have My Money. The plot centres on the singer’s character seeking revenge on a rich man who owes her a debt. Being Rihanna, a woman rarely undone by a man, she successfully procures what she’s owed – but she does so by kidnapping, stripping and torturing the man’s wife, before murdering her. While much of the violence is implied, the wife (played by Canadian supermodel Rachel Roberts) is shown topless and strung up in a warehouse, forced to take drugs and eventually drowned – it’s a graphic revenge fantasy in which a woman tortures and kills another woman, albeit one shot in glossy, David LaChapelle-esque style. It’s not necessarily the sort of fantasy most of us have, but this is Rihanna – and she has a budget.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"445724bacfc496ce008aecf9cc20d7728b5923e5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436202077811/9a7dcc2d-47b7-4629-a025-1b25ac0ecdad-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Canadian supermodel Rachel Roberts plays Rihanna's victim.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Canadian supermodel Rachel Roberts plays Rihanna’s victim.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeremy Chan Photography/WireImage</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Naturally, the themes of sexualised violence, seemingly gratuitous nudity and non-consensual BDSM sent segments of the world’s media into a state of apoplexy, with commentators for once unified in their disgust. In the New Statesman, Helen Lewis outlined how, quite simply: <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/07/lets-talk-about-rihannas-video\">“It is not very feminist to torture women”</a>. And that the notion of using “a woman’s pain to hurt a man” plays into a tired and outdated device of “<a href=\"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/StuffedIntoTheFridge\">fridging</a>” (in which a character – usually female – is harmed solely to hurt another). In the Daily Mail, Sarah Vine <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3150454/Rihanna-video-turn-mothers-stomachs-Concerned-parent-SARAH-VINE-star-s-latest-song-glorifies-murder-torture-drug-taking-guns-racial-stereotyping.html\">argued that it glorifies and justifies “negative racial stereotyping (towards both black and white), sexual exploitation and murder”</a>. Writing in the Observer, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jul/05/rihannas-video-bitch-better-have-my-money-misogynistic\">Barbara Ellen said her aversion to the film was rooted largely in the misogyny of the plot</a>, adding that, having been a victim of domestic violence, Rihanna should know better.</p> \n<p>Roberts is a successful Canadian supermodel. has appeared on the pages of Vogue, in campaigns for Ralph Lauren and, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, on the catwalk for Chlo&eacute;, Balmain and Versace. Speaking over the phone from New York, Roberts says she was aware that the violence and nudity would prove controversial: “I knew what I was getting into … And, yes, it is more in your face than a lot of videos but, for me, with regards to nudity, so long as it isn’t gratuitous and [it is] there for a reason, then it’s fine.” The reason here, continues Roberts, is humiliation: “That’s not to defend the idea of a woman being humiliated – but, within the context of the story, it makes sense that [Rihanna] forces her to go topless and hang upside down.”</p> \n<p>The nudity point might be controversial but, says Roberts, when you compare it to the more widespread nudity of the fashion industry, it’s not clear-cut: “In fashion, for example, nudity is not a big thing.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jul/06/rihannas-bitch-better-have-my-money-feminism-misogyny-race\">Rihanna's video puts a black woman in control – no wonder there's a backlash</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But what of the violence, which is indisputably excessive for a music video? (If the medium is the message, isn’t it irresponsible for a star with such a young fanbase to produce such a macabre video?) “Obviously, it’s risque – but there are a lot of films, say Tarantino’s, that are far more graphic and violent.”</p> \n<p>“It’s a video … it’s not real. I understand that some people will not like it because of the torture … Rihanna’s character chooses to torture a man’s wife before ultimately killing the man himself. But the anger has to be there to match the sentiment of the song. Whether or not you like what she’s doing in the video, Rihanna is portraying a strong woman, who is fighting back, even if her methods are obviously highly questionable. Beyond that,” she says, “I don’t think it’s particularly useful to argue the politics of the video – it was always meant to be over-the-top and not taken too seriously.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"514c98bf8263a4e6859f734413a56fef832a9607\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436201902629/9275e931-5ced-45ef-bbe2-3beb28e44a1f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sarah Vine argues that the video glorifies and justifies 'negative racial stereotyping (towards both black and white), sexual exploitation and murder'\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Vine argues that the video glorifies and justifies ‘negative racial stereotyping (towards both black and white), sexual exploitation and murder’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: .</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Much of the criticism levelled at Rihanna and her French co-directors Megaforce has focused on the anti-feminist narrative, compounded by the tacit “torture” and murder of the husband, which plays as more of an afterthought. Commenters have also been quick to pick up on the fact the husband, played by a wide-eyed <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/mads-mikkelsen\">Mads Mikkelsen</a>, remains clothed throughout. Perhaps naively, Roberts maintains that, despite the violent themes, “there is a feminist message … It’s about a strong woman seeking revenge against a man who has probably wronged her.”</p> \n<p>Roberts herself identifies as a feminist: “In the sense that I believe women should be treated equally. I was raised by a strong woman who never allowed herself or me to be disrespected. Having been a model and actress for many years, it does take a strong sense of self and good survival instincts to have a lasting career. If you can’t look after yourself, they are industries that will chew you up and spit you out.” At the end of the day, Roberts summarises, Rihanna is a strong woman and whatever she does will always “push the envelope – but she knows what she’s doing”.</p> \n<p><em>Rachel Roberts is represented by Next Models</em></p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/e7dff8948d2e79aa1e5dc6fff46e3a33e06d4a59/0_0_2559_1536/2559.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1536,"width":2559,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"vevo","altText":"The video for Bitch Better Have My Money sent the world’s media into a state of apoplexy, with commentators unified in their disgust.

Fortunately, Shabnam didn’t discover her fiance shackled with the furry handcuffs, but that’s not to say she doesn’t have her own issues.

However, in your situation, it is probably best for you to take responsibility solely for your own pleasure, and encourage him to do the same. Wanting increased pleasure for him is understandable, but might be experienced as pressure to have sex your way, rather than his. You could, however, try to get him to give you precise feedback as you pleasure him manually or orally – as long as it doesn’t become uncomfortable for him. Keep checking – “Do you want me to continue, or shall we switch to something else?”</p> \n<p>I recommend you first try eliciting feedback from him with erotic caresses to non-genital parts of each other. You could model the kind of detailed feedback you want from him first, as he tries different kinds of strokes and touches on you. This is a good way to learn about each others’ responses. Eventually – when there is a high level of relaxation, communication and non-goal-oriented desire between you – you could progress to genital stimulation.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</em></p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\"><em>private.lives@theguardian.com</em></a><em> (please don’t send attachments).</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435941668241/Young-man-sleeping-in-bed-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'I’m losing interest because I can’t enjoy his pleasure' (posed by models).

Was it a comment on the debased state of fame, or just the usual narcissism?</p>","byline":"Hadley Freeman","body":"<p><strong>With the benefit of hindsight, what was the fashion story of Glastonbury 2015?</strong></p> \n<p><em>Name withheld, by email</em></p> \n<p>Truly, at least a week is what is necessary in order to cogitate, consider and, indeed, collect one’s thoughts on this momentous matter. Are floral headpieces over? (Yes.) Is tie dye too Camden Market? (Yes.) (Incidentally, “too Camden Market” was one of the ultimate disses at my school back in the 1990s and one I have found to be surprisingly useful and enduring.) Are hotpants ever a good idea in a field? (No.) But these are all general rules that can, really, be applied to any Glastonbury. Our business here today is whether there were any fashion trends at the festival that can be tied specifically to 2015 in the manner of the historic – nay, seminal – time in 2004 when <a href=\"http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/fashion/celebrity-fashion/2013/06/glastonbury-best-festival-fashion-sienna-miller-kate-moss-alexa-chung/viewgallery/998153\" title=\"\">Sienna Miller wore a low-slung belt</a>, or when Kate Moss wore <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/kimberleydadds/a-history-of-kate-moss-at-glastonbury#.bcye2zokN\" title=\"\">wellingtons and a long jumper in 2005</a>. Oh, blessed are we who lived through such epoch shaping times!</p> \n<p>Well, I am happy to say that the answer is yes, there was such a fashion statement at this summer’s festival and, for once, it had nothing to do with looking thin, nor was it dependent on being so. Boho is still a massive no-no but, proving that K-Mo, as no one has ever called her, is always ahead of everyone in fashion trends (and possibly EasyJet queues), it does have to do with wellingtons. This year, was all about the monogrammed wellington.</p> \n<p>Now, I say “all about the monogrammed wellington”, but what makes it a fashion trend was its elitist nature. That is how fashion trends work, you see. When fashion writers deem something is a trend, they mean that three over-photographed women have worn it (fashion writer rule: two’s a coincidence, three’s a trend). Then when the public obey this edict and wear it for themselves, the trend is immediately damned as “overexposed” and the whole process starts again. Hey! No one ever said fashion was easy, people.</p> \n<p>This summer, a well-known wellington company, which I won’t name (but they are welcome to buy advertising if they want publicity in this paper) gave wellingtons to certain celebrities monogrammed with their names on them in place of the company’s logo. Now, this being a music festival fashion trend, obviously only geniuses were included in this gifting: Noam Chomsky, Peter Higgs, Alice Munro … Wait, sorry, apparently I’m reading off the wrong list here. Actually, it was Poppy Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Daisy Lowe. Well, I was close there, but I maintain that dear Noam would look MARVELLOUS in a pair of a monogrammed wellingtons. Rumours reach me that Kim Kardashian also had a pair of monogrammed wellingtons but these are impossible to confirm because Kardashian was careful to be photographed only wearing her stilettos on the muddy Somerset fields.</p> \n<p>Taking a small detour for a moment, can we all just stand up and applaud dear Kim for remaining so utterly true to herself – her inner Kardashian-ness – that she refused to alter her style a jot for Glastonbury? If you have never been to a fashion festival, especially one as over-scrutinised as Glastonbury, you have no idea how hard it is to resist the suction pull of festival fever. You arrive on the Friday in your normal clothes, utterly determined not to be a festival cliche and sneering at those who are. By Sunday, you’re rolling around in a field in denim hotpants, a faux vintage band T-shirt and a fringed poncho, talking to someone called “Bristol Jack” about how we’re all totally connected, man. Gwyneth Paltrow, Mick Jagger, even Lionel Richie – not people one can accuse of being low-maintenance, and yet all of them have bent their usual personal style to accommodate the whims of Glastonbury’s surprisingly persuasive fashion rules. But not our Kim. Even at four months pregnant, she insisted on sporting her now signature awkward-length lycra dress and strappy sandals while trudging through Somerset. Kardashian did confess on Twitter that she had sported wellingtons at some point in the day, but clearly this was such a painful event for her that she managed to – gasp! – stop taking selfies for the period of time in which she wore&nbsp;them so as to ensure absolutely no&nbsp;photographic evidence of this moment of shoe-style slumming. Say what you like about the Kardashians, but you gotta give them this: they are never off-brand.</p> \n<p>Anyway, back to the monogrammed wellingtons. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2014/sep/05/monograms-clothes-touch-class\" title=\"\">Monogramming has become quite a thing in fashion</a> and, on the whole, I endorse it. Seeing as so much emphasis in fashion is placed on, strangely, looking the same as everyone else, there is something quite satisfying about individualising that handbag, or whatever, you spent a week’s wages on.</p> \n<p>But these monogrammed wellingtons – oof. For a start, in the world of monogramming, there is a distinct difference between putting your initials (classy, subtle) on something and putting your name on it (a bit cutesy-wootsy, childish). But the real point here is that these boots were only available to celebrities, ie people whose names are perfectly well-known already and do not need their boots to introduce them. Unless, perhaps, the boot company was making an ironic comment that the term celebrity is now so debased that the public needs help ascertaining their actual names. I mean, could you identify Poppy Delevingne in a crowd if your life depended on it? I rest my case. If that was the modus operandi, well played, boot company. If, on the other hand, it was yet another way to celebrate celebrity narcissism, get in the sea, boot company.</p> \n<p><em>Post your questions to Hadley Freeman, Ask&nbsp;Hadley, The Guardian, Kings Place,&nbsp;90&nbsp;York &nbsp;Way, London N1 9GU.

So how can you navigate a year abroad on a restricted diet?</p> \n<h2>Come prepared</h2> \n<p> Abigail Jones (not her real name) studies French and Italian at the University of Kent, and is allergic to nuts, as well as mosquito bites. She found preparation key for her time in Switzerland and Italy: “I keep a ready supply of the stuff I need in case I get bitten or eat something. Make sure you know exactly how to explain to waiters that you have an allergy, so you don’t accidentally order something that could make you ill.” </p> \n<p>Allergy UK offers <a href=\"https://www.allergyuk.org/getting-help/translation-cards\" rel=\"nofollow\">translation cards</a> and gives advice for coping with allergies when travelling. To ask students who might have been in your situation for advice, start a discussion on the <a href=\"http://tyaanswers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Third Year Abroad</a> website.</p> \n<h2>Research your destination</h2> \n<p> Find out how aware your host country is of your requirement. Awareness can vary considerably from place to place, even for common medical conditions. Jess Husbands studies French and Spanish at the University of Edinburgh, and is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">coeliac</a>. “Spain was much better than France for being coeliac: if I said ‘soy coeliaca’ in Spain, most people knew what it was. But in France no one had heard of it – I had to say ‘je suis allergique au bl&eacute;’ which is obviously not the same thing.”</p> \n<p>In France only <a href=\"http://www.afdiag.fr/intolerance-au-gluten/la-maladie-coeliaque/\" rel=\"nofollow\">10 to 20% of coeliacs</a> are diagnosed, making awareness levels much lower than in the UK. Coeliac UK provides useful <a href=\"https://www.coeliac.org.uk/gluten-free-diet-and-lifestyle/holidays-and-travel/country-guides/\" rel=\"nofollow\">country guides</a>, detailing awareness levels, and where to find products and local coeliac groups.</p> \n<h2><strong>Try new things</strong></h2> \n<p> Having to be a bit more creative with your culinary choices can turn into an advantage. Chlo&euml; Rose, a Jewish student at the University of Birmingham, spent a year in Spain: “I found out before I went that there was no Jewish community in Granada, which meant getting kosher food would be next to impossible. I decided the best option would be to go vegetarian.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jun/17/what-nobody-tells-students-about-studying-abroad\">What nobody tells you about studying abroad</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Although she missed eating meat, Rose didn’t struggle to find something she enjoyed eating. “Eating out can be difficult but we often went to restaurants where there are plenty of meat-free options. I expanded my range of what I eat a lot more than I did in Birmingham: I tried couscous, and I didn’t really eat eggs before, but now I feel better that I have more healthy options instead of just resorting to fish fingers or a frozen pizza. And if in doubt I always have tortilla.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Don’t worry!</strong></h2> \n<p> When preparing to go abroad, the threat of endless uninspiring dinners can fill restricted eaters with dread. But food is only one small aspect of life, as it is at home, and your diet won’t deprive you of your best memories. “There will always be something to eat,” adds Rose. “I knew that other parts of my year abroad – such as location and the university – were more important than what I was going to eat every day.”</p> \n<p> By taking the same precautions as you would at home, and doing research before arriving – as you would for any other aspect of your time abroad, like accommodation – there’s no reason why a restricted diet should get in the way of a great year.</p> \n<p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GdnStudents</a> – and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433777810531/Skull-and-crossed-bones-t-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"/Alamy","altText":"Skull and crossed bones toast","cleanCredit":"Photograph: /Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T11:30:13Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T11:47:51Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":109,"contributors":[{"name":"Fiona Henry","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/fiona-henry"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Students","Education","Higher education","International students","Studying abroad","Advice for students","Allergies","Food and drink","Vegetarianism"],"tags":[{"id":"education/students","webTitle":"Students"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"education/higher-education","webTitle":"Higher education"},{"id":"education/internationalstudents","webTitle":"International students"},{"id":"education/studying-abroad","webTitle":"Studying abroad"},{"id":"education/advice-for-students","webTitle":"Advice for students"},{"id":"society/allergies","webTitle":"Allergies"},{"id":"travel/travelfoodanddrink","webTitle":"Food and drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/vegetarianism","webTitle":"Vegetarianism"}],"section":{"id":"education"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Fiona Henry","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/fiona-henry"}}],"series":{"title":"The global student","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/education/series/the-global-student"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"education"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jul/06/world-on-your-plate-how-to-cope-abroad-on-a-restricted-diet","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49thq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/education/2015/jul/06/world-on-your-plate-how-to-cope-abroad-on-a-restricted-diet","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/06/world-on-your-plate-how-to-cope-abroad-on-a-restricted-diet"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433777810531/Skull-and-crossed-bones-t-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Not everywhere will cater for your dietary requirements, so do your research before you travel.
