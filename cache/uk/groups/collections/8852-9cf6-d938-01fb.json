It’s really expensive for a brow product, but if you’re someone who finds their brows wear off throughout the day, you may still find it economical. The slim, slanted crayon is so easy to navigate and really, truly does stay put for as long as you want it to. I’m prepared to say it’s the best brow crayon I’ve ever used.</p> \n<p>Cheaper but with the same idea, is <a href=\"http://hdbrows.com/browtec.html\"><strong>HD Brows’ Browtec</strong>, &pound;16</a>, which is near impossible to get wrong. Achieve the softest, most natural looking filled-in brow by first combing them downwards with a clean mascara wand, to get them out of the way. Then, take your brush, pen or crayon and trace over the footprint of your brows, using light feathery strokes. When the brow shape is filled in, comb your brows back up again, so they sit over the crayon or pencil lines. This makes them look full, but not drawn on. It works brilliantly. </p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431440306209/77f16d30-f690-490e-a07f-3bf4826f9a85-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Rui Faria for the Guardian","altText":"'A softer brow often looks more modern, less try-hard than dark, sharp lines.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rui Faria for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-16T05:00:18Z","lastModified":"2015-05-16T05:00:18Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":9,"contributors":[{"name":"Sali Hughes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sali-hughes"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Beauty","Fashion","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"fashion/beauty","webTitle":"Beauty"},{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"fashion"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sali Hughes","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sali-hughes"}}],"series":{"title":"Sali Hughes on beauty","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/fashion/series/sali-hughes-beauty"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"fashion"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2015/may/16/beauty-new-brow-products","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48x94","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/fashion/2015/may/16/beauty-new-brow-products","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/16/beauty-new-brow-products"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431440306209/77f16d30-f690-490e-a07f-3bf4826f9a85-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘A softer brow often looks more modern, less try-hard than dark, sharp lines.’ Photograph: Rui Faria for the Guardian","credit":"Rui Faria for the Guardian","altText":"'A softer brow often looks more modern, less try-hard than dark, sharp lines.'","cleanCaption":"‘A softer brow often looks more modern, less try-hard than dark, sharp lines.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Rui Faria for the Guardian"}},"importance":5,"kicker":{"title":"Sali Hughes on beauty"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Ones to watch / Meet the new generation of woodworkers","rawTitle":"Meet the new generation of woodworkers","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/may/16/new-generation-woodworkers-tables-chairs-design","title":"Into the wood: meet the modern carpenters","trailText":"Want traditional creations with a contemporary twist?

Today’s woodworkers may be well versed in traditional mortise and tenons and chamfering, but their creations come with a contemporary twist – shapes or materials that keep their furniture edgy rather than old-fashioned. Mix English ash with Perspex, spray-painted ply or copper? Go for milky tones and tapered silhouettes? Why not?</p> \n<p>For <a href=\"http://www.tedjefferis.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Ted Jefferis</a>, the son of a boatbuilder, it’s all about the character and possibilities of British hardwoods. The outlines of his TipToe bench might be modern, and its detailing simple and pared back, but his ethos is reassuringly old school. “Everything stems from the strength and shape of the legs,” he says. “They taper away to the finest points possible, while still supporting the structure.”</p> \n<p>Jefferis retains a reverence for the hand-worked wood at the core of his furniture. “Every piece is different,” he says. “As you work, you have to bend to the tree. And if you’re churning out hundreds by machine, you can’t do that.” But before he gets too back-to-nature-Shaker, Jefferis surprises by spray-painting the legs in shades from hot orange to racing green: “They’ve been mistaken for metal,” he says, “or even, God forbid, plastic.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7477abb63e86a7cd168a15bb7679b4db658b71f5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/30/1430388779513/66121be9-675b-47c6-93a9-f030566053c8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"woodworker Rupert McKelvie\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘You can honour the wild in any setting’: Rupert McKelvie with his Leaf cabinet</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Like Jefferis, <a href=\"http://rupertmckelvie.com/\" title=\"\">Rupert McKelvie</a> likes to add unexpected finishes. So side tables are topped in swirls of patinated brass, oil and water, and the tips of table legs are darkened by a naked flame, mimicking an ancient technique that preserves by charring. “The fire makes it stronger but also hints at the life and death of the wood,” he says. His elegant Leaf cabinet, meanwhile, is about seasonal cycles, made in sweet chestnut felled in autumn and veneered with leaves from the same tree.</p> \n<p>McKelvie’s work ranges from the practical – a small-scale table and chairs that began as prototypes to furnish his woodland cabin – to fantasy-laden creations that meditate on his rural surroundings but would work as well in a city studio. “They are still about the wild, but you can honour that in any setting,” he says.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b8dfc6926ebe7dda4e82b21b2e72df02af53bae\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/30/1430389444095/2078373c-b702-4930-a6c4-0fea37a31cde-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"woodworker Alexander White\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘It’s important to keep pushing the boundaries’: Alexander White with his Monroe chair</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In <a href=\"http://www.awhiteworkshop.com/\" title=\"\">Alexander White</a>’s hands, wood is paired with Perspex or copper piping to create pieces that would not look out of place in an art gallery. “I&nbsp;love the old ways,” he says, “but I&nbsp;don’t rely on them. It’s important to keep pushing the boundaries.” His TopNotch desk is like a giant puzzle of traditional Japanese joints – “no glue or screws” – that’s been fitted with ultra-modern Perspex drawers; his Monroe chair is a layered cascade of wooden blades, like swans’ wings or fanned book pages. It got its name after White heard a client compare it to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2014/sep/15/marilyn-monroe-seven-year-itch-dress\" title=\"\">the billowing folds of Marilyn’s dress</a> as she stood over the subway grate. “I thought, that’s genius – I’ll nick it.”</p> \n<p>With Jefferis’s bench starting at &pound;490 and McKelvie’s work at &pound;475, this is investment furniture.

I light candles and have a&nbsp;bath using a Lush bath bomb. I&nbsp;shave my legs and use Origins ginger body scrub, because if you are going to have your legs or arms out a scrub makes your skin look healthier. Then I use Lush King of Skin – it looks like soap but it’s a&nbsp;block of moisture. It’s way more intense than a&nbsp;moisturiser and makes the skin really glow. After that, I&nbsp;do my hair: I would have washed it in the shower that morning and tied it up on top of my head. I use my BaByliss curling&nbsp;wand to make big loose waves and put in Oribe texturising&nbsp;spray.</p> \n<p>I allow 45 minutes for makeup –&nbsp;foundation and concealer, brows and shadow sticks (cream eye shadow in a stick form). Then I use liquid liner and lots of individual fake lashes, and apply mascara to both the fake and real ones. I put on&nbsp;some contour and blush and, unless I am wearing a red lip, just lip&nbsp;balm or gloss.</p> \n<p>I have an hourglass shape, so I&nbsp;show off my waist. You should find&nbsp;your smallest part and accentuate that. If I wear something baggy that hangs straight off my boobs, it makes me look a lot bigger. I am 5ft 4in and wear really high heels which make my legs look&nbsp;better.</p> \n<p>I suffer from anxiety and often cancel nights out if I am not feeling up to it. It became an issue when I&nbsp;was 13 but, while having therapy, I realised that I have had it since I&nbsp;was about seven. I see an amazing hypnotherapist and I never let it ruin my dreams and goals.

The suedette seats reminded me of that headline in the Onion when Diana died (“Princess Dies As She Lived: In Incredible Plushness”). The gigantic boot could hold any tat you might throw in it – blow-up mattresses and buckets and spades, travel cots and micro scooters, plastic bags full of things that would end up lost – and still give the appearance of order and tessellation. The headlamps have an elegant, feline shape and the car has a&nbsp;nice balance – weighty and serious at the back, sleek at the front. Driving it, you look as though you have a pension and an Ocado account; you look like someone who sends their forms back on time, and who never lets their athlete’s foot get out of control.</p> \n<p>Motorway driving showed off all this smooth confidence; a bit of height has been added to the seats, which give you a rather kingly posture. It’s a little noisier than you’d expect – tyre roar, mainly – but otherwise this felt proper, executive. (I&nbsp;don’t think the next generation will realise that “executive” once referred to a type of job; they’ll think it’s just a word for “comfy car”.)</p> \n<p>On shorter journeys, it was a little less rosy. The display in the binnacle constantly nudges you up a gear – 6th, 6th, it urges, just because you’ve touched 31mph on a clear road – and the two-litre turbo diesel engine isn’t up to maintaining any punch at a borderline-too-high gear. The turbo element doesn’t feel as beefy as in cars that look less ambitious, like the Passat. The answer, I guess, is don’t listen to the instruction; but that annoys me, since it was taking up space in my eyeline that could have been used for, I don’t know, a clock.</p> \n<p>There’s a lag on the satnav that is frankly disgraceful – a proper, pull-over, drum-your-fingers delay between one screen and the next. As the satnav is the main, immediately noticeable difference between the standard and tech versions (that, and &pound;2,000) it ought to be way better.</p> \n<p>Yet that’s a quibble in the grander scheme, where fuel economy (57.6mpg combined) is impressive for a wagon like this. Carbon emissions are 129g/km; again, pretty impressive, if not head-turning. The steering is light, and I won some admirers with my parking on a curved main road – either that or they were just gaping at my discourteous London ways.</p> \n<p>In the final analysis: a lot of class but not quite enough welly. Like a&nbsp;pair of those ankle Hunters.</p> \n<h2>Seat Leon X-perience: in numbers</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"8a6781c1e8ff9203aac6a73669778a7666828a85\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/6/1430926366944/590ade0a-b02e-408e-a758-c69497b0975e-460x457.jpeg\" alt=\"Seat X-perience detail\" width=\"460\" height=\"457\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Price</strong> &pound;26,370<br /><strong>Top speed</strong> 129mph<br /><strong>Acceleration</strong> 0-62mph in 8.7 seconds<br /><strong>Combined fuel consumption</strong> 57.6mpg<br /><strong>CO2 emissions</strong> 129g/km <br /><strong>Eco rating</strong> 7/10<br /><strong>Cool rating</strong> 7/10</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/5/6/1430926084245/On-the-road-Seat-Leon-X-p-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Seat Leon X-perience: 'It's a little noisier than you'd expect but otherwise it felt proper, executive.'
