I feed the dogs and two cats, check e-mails and sort out last-minute paperwork for the day ahead. </p> \n<p>Then it’s off in the car to wherever I’m based that day – it could be Windsor, Ascot, Maidenhead or London. Thursdays are always just NHS work while the rest of the week is taken up with a mixture of private and NHS appointments, going to multi-disciplinary meetings and discussing individual patients for more precise medical recommendations. </p> \n<p>Before surgery starts at 8am I always see my patients. I will talk to a man while his wife looks on anxiously about life-threatening prostate cancer for which he is about to have a Da Vinci prostatectomy (robotic prostate removal). I will show a man an enhanced MRI of his prostate and where a cancer may be prior to performing targeted biopsies by placing needles through the skin between the anus and scrotum. </p> \n<p>To discuss the day’s operations, the nurses and I then huddle together around the most popular place in the hospital – the coffee cart, started up by entrepreneurial eastern Europeans and serving extra-strong coffee! </p> \n<p>The rest of the morning is taken up with operations. I sit at a console looking into a 3D visual display remotely operating instruments to separate the prostate cancer while gently protecting the delicate nerves that hold the prostate in a hammock. Later, I may use a laser on someone who has prostate enlargement to dissect and vaporise the inner enlarged prostate from the rest.<br /> <br />I first become interested in urology and prostate cancer when I was carrying out my research fellowship at Imperial College London into bone metastasis (the spread of cancer into the bone). So when a consultant post came up in urology I knew that was what I wanted to do.</p> \n<p>Prostate cancer is a particularly fascinating and challenging area because, unlike many other cancers, there is no set diagnostic or treatment pathway. This means you have to treat each patient on an individual basis, taking account not just of their cancer, but also their lifestyle, family situation and hopes for the future. You make decisions with them, not for them, and this has made me a more receptive and empathetic doctor.</p> \n<p>The potential side effects of prostate cancer treatment, for example loss of potency or bladder function, can be life-changing and I am passionate about trying to improve outcomes for my patients.</p> \n<p>The afternoons are like the mornings in their variety. I see men in my clinic who are at risk of prostate cancer or who may have it, and use enhanced MRI scans and genetic tests to establish the risk of serious disease. </p> \n<p>I work with Macmillan cancer nurse specialists to counsel men about their level of risk and the treatment options, as well as how to recover their erectile functions.</p> \n<p>I usually finish around 8 or 9pm after checking my patients and doing some admin like writing up or dictating notes, and scanning images. I used to carry large piles of notes around with me, but not anymore – everything being electronic has made work a lot easier and more productive.</p> \n<p>Evenings are usually dinner with the family and catching up with a TV box set. I am on call every fifth weekend but otherwise will watch my two boys play rugby and football or go sailing and windsurfing off the Dorset coast. </p> \n<p>The challenge is to keep learning new skills because the prostate cancer world is always changing. I want to specialise more, do more focal and less invasive surgery. </p> \n<p>My field has changed enormously in recent years which has improved outcomes immensely and will continue to do so. As diagnostic technology becomes more advanced we will be able to determine which cancers need treatment and which can be left alone which should mean far fewer interventions and far fewer men and their families, living with the devastating consequences of prostate cancer – great news for everyone.</p> \n<p><em>If you would like to be featured in our <a

Laterality has been observed in animals such as jumping frogs, killer whales and four-legged marsupials such as gray short-tailed opossums and sugar gliders.<br /></p> \n<p>However, such a consistently strong preference for one or the other as seen with humans, in which 90% of the population have a bias towards their right hand and 10% have bias towards their left, is relatively uncommon.</p> \n<p>The discovery marks the first two-legged animal other than humans or great apes – both of which tend to be right-handed – that has exhibited such a strong preference for one hand.</p> \n<p>Significantly, a study of the four-limbed Goodfellow’s tree kangaroo at Taronga zoo and several German zoos found no preference for either left or right paw. Ingram said this strengthened the link between posture and handedness.</p> \n<p>The finding could contribute to a greater understanding of how the left and right brain hemispheres control laterality, and lead to the discovery of new brain pathways in marsupials.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434689363875/ce121a6f-765f-432c-af24-b554a518b3c1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Frans Lanting/Frans Lanting/Corbis","altText":"Eastern grey kangaroo","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Frans Lanting/Frans Lanting/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/57e919c658d18d89c7de593a580bb7f6b6d53635/0_77_1181_708/1181.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":708,"width":1181,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Red-necked wallabies also showed a strong preference for the left paw, with one interesting exception.

But I can recall standing still in the pre-dawn pitch and listening, mesmerized by the <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/173744\">plaintive anthem</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.online-literature.com/wordsworth/2221/\">fast thick warble</a> of a nightingale.

A male nightingale sings to impress a female and there’s more to this ritual than simply wowing her with his repertory. Several features of a nightingale’s song are an accurate predictor of how good a parent he will be, according to research published today.</p> \n<p>By avian musical standards, the male nightingale is a virtuoso, with a repertoire of around 180 different song types that he can pick and choose and sequence to suit the time of day, the occasion, the season or his stage of life. A male nightingale also plays a significant role in the reproductive effort, feeding his partner whilst she’s incubating, bringing food for the hatchlings and defending the nest against predators. </p> \n<p>Conny Bartsch and her colleagues set out to explore whether a male’s song might be an honest indicator of the effort he’ll put in as a parent. Like a promise. They recorded males singing early in the breeding season before they had paired and used micro transponders to collect dawn-to-dusk data on how often these same males visited their nests to feed their young nestlings. <br /></p> \n<p>“Males with a more ordered singing style and more complex song repertoires fed their chicks more often,” the researchers write in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-015-0390-5\">BMC Evolutionary Biology</a>. “We were surprised that multiple song features - instead of one ‘key’ song feature - were related to male feeding effort,” says Bartsch. In a busy world in which female nightingales must choose a mate based on scant snatches of song, it may pay males to advertise their parental skills in more than one way, the authors suggest.<br /></p> \n<p>It should be noted that the association between song characteristics and paternal care is is just a correlation. But if humans can use a male nightingale’s call to make accurate predictions about his provisioning skills, it is almost certain that female nightingales can do so too</p> \n<p>What do you remember of your first nightingale?

On <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HLzr5xv36UI\" title=\"\">Better Man</a>, which opens almost identically to Smokey Robinson’s I Second That Emotion, he sings “I’d swim the Mississippi river / If&nbsp;you’d give me another start, girl,” before backing singers chime in with some “doo wop”s. Shine is a stirring, horn-led gospel waltz that could have been recorded while Sam Cooke was alive. These are fine songs, sung soulfully, but is that enough? The best retro-soul singers – <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/amywinehouse\" title=\"\">Amy Winehouse</a> or <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/cee-lo-green\" title=\"\">Cee-Lo Green</a> – take these influences and add something fresh by putting themselves into the record.
