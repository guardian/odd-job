For the fans, it’s like ‘wow, she can really sing’ because she belted it out.”</p> \n<p>Smule may not win the same media attention as Spotify, Apple Music or Tidal, but it is one of the quiet success stories of the digital music world.</p> \n<p>The company’s collection of music apps – Sing! Karaoke, Magic Piano, AutoRap, Guitar! and Ocarina – now have more than 25 million monthly active users singing, playing and rapping some 10m songs a day.</p> \n<p>Smule charges &pound;2.29 a week, &pound;5.99 a month or &pound;29.99 a year for unlimited access to its apps’ catalogue of music. The business model has helped annual revenues rise from $20m in 2013 to $40m (&pound;25.3m) last year.</p> \n<p>“We’re a social network that’s as much about creation as consumption. It’s not a karaoke company per se: we’re building a network around music and performance,” says chief executive Jeff Smith.</p> \n<p>Smule is about more than fans duetting with famous artists. The company recently launched a feature called “group video” for the Sing! Karaoke app, which automatically turns footage of groups of singers around the world performing the same song into single, edited videos.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwTmgreD_Ds\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NwTmgreD_Ds?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Smule did not release any new apps last year4, opting instead to work on new features for its existing apps, including group video. </p> \n<p>However, it’s the artist programme that is putting Smule on the music industry’s radar - particularly since the Jessie J promotion. The nature of its apps mean the company does not pay royalties to labels for the master recordings of songs but focuses instead on royalties to music publishers for the compositions.</p> \n<p>“We count streams and we pay on streams, and the royalty that we’re paying on publishing is probably twice what [US streaming music service] Pandora will pay as a percentage of sales, so it’s legit, and it’s a significant source of income for the folks that have the talent to write songs,” says Smith.</p> \n<p>“Performers are great, but writers are great too ... there’s something really special about tapping in to these writers and empowering them, and celebrating them.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/feb/20/ward-alvord-days-boyce-avenue-youtube-pop-stars\">Streaming in: the new wave of pop stars created by YouTube</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>‘Wholesale transition’</h2> \n<p>Smule’s apps are tapping into the same desire for an audience that fuels people to enter TV talent contests. Yet the company is keen to build more of a community than that suggests.</p> \n<p>“I think we’re seeing a wholesale transition in media: a democratisation of the process. X Factor and the Voice was a logical venue to be introducing new talent, but it’s not the destination. The pendulum is swinging more and more towards individuals discovering individuals organically,” says Smith.</p> \n<p>Smith has a theory about what’s happening on Smule, but also on platforms such as YouTube and SoundCloud where users can upload musical performances – or, indeed, vlogs and other forms of entertainment.</p> \n<p>“I think people want something fresh and authentic. They want it to be real,” Smith adds. </p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434969085241/4e2ebab7-f6d0-4f61-9494-73ba787c393a-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"David M.

Make sure you’re keeping up with the changes","standFirst":"<p>Since April 2015 it has been easier to safeguard your pension for your heirs. Make sure you’re keeping up with the changes</p>","byline":"Holly Thomas","body":"<p>You’ve worked and saved throughout your life so that your pension will provide you with enough to live on in retirement. Now, thanks to changes in the way that pensions are taxed, more of your fund can survive your death and provide an income or nest egg for your loved ones to enjoy, long after you are gone.</p> \n<p>This is because, although pensions aren’t counted as someone’s estate for inheritance tax purposes, until recently there has been a hefty 55% pensions death tax. This was scrapped in April as part of the government’s “pensions revolution”, which also marked the end of the requirement for savers to swap life savings to buy an annuity </p> \n<p>There is now enormous opportunity to leave some, or all, of your pot to your loved ones in a tax-efficient way.</p> \n<h2><strong>The rules</strong></h2> \n<p>In broad terms, if you die before the age of 75 your beneficiaries will pay no tax on any pension savings left to them. This means that wealth built up in a pension can be passed on as inheritance without losing the tax shelter or any tax charge, regardless of whether withdrawals have been made.</p> \n<p>On your 75th birthday your pension assets become taxable, but only at the marginal rate of income tax. A charge of 45% will apply if benefits are taken as a lump sum today, although this is due to change in April 2016 when the beneficiary’s marginal rate of income tax will apply.</p> \n<p>You can nominate anyone to inherit your remaining pension fund as a drawdown account. This means beneficiaries can dip into the pension pot they inherit as and when they want.</p> \n<h2><strong>Planning ahead</strong></h2> \n<p>To make sure you can pass on your pension in a tax-efficient manner, there are a few things to do.</p> \n<p>First, take your 25% tax-free cash lump sum before you turn 75. If you don’t it will be counted as taxable. Ian Naismith at Scottish Widows says: “In almost all cases you should take the tax-free cash.”</p> \n<p>Second, as Julie Hutchison at Standard Life advises: “Check if your pension plan allows you to pass on your savings in a tax-efficient way.” Older styles of pension schemes may not allow your beneficiaries to inherit your fund as a drawdown account. “You may need to upgrade to a more modern pension that does,” she adds, although this can cause problems: “Valuable guarantees sometimes apply to older pensions.”</p> \n<p>The next move is to give up-to-date details of the nominated beneficiaries of your pension fund to your provider. This might involve using an expression of wish form.</p> \n<p>“It will come as a surprise to many that your will does not do this job,” Hutchison says. “Pension providers should allow you to nominate your beneficiaries when you start paying into your pension, or at any subsequent time. It should be possible to change the beneficiary easily, and some allow you to do it online.”</p> \n<p>It is possible to nominate more than one beneficiary, and decide in what proportion you want each person to benefit.</p> \n<h2><strong>Defined benefit schemes</strong></h2> \n<p>If you’re in a defined benefit or final-salary pension that pays out an income, and you want to pass on your money to a beneficiary when you die, you may be told you can transfer your pot into a different kind of scheme that allows you to access your cash. Be very wary of doing so. </p> \n<p>“Transferring a defined benefit scheme is a one-way move,” warns Nathan Long at Hargreaves Lansdown. “If you take the plunge you cannot go back, and in reality the majority of members are likely to be better off keeping their scheme intact. Some may benefit from transferring, but this is the exception and not the rule.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Distributing your savings</strong></h2> \n<p>You can name any number of beneficiaries for your pension. For example, if you have grandchildren it can be more tax-efficient to leave a portion of your pension directly to them after you turn 75. That way, each grandchild can make the most of their &pound;10,600 personal income tax allowance – so, if they have no other sources of income, they can each withdraw up to &pound;10,600 from your pension tax-free, every year. By contrast, if you die after the age of 75 and leave your pension to your children, they would have to pay their highest rate of income tax on the pension withdrawal.</p> \n<p>Ian Dyall, head of estate planning at Towry, says: “One option you can consider when using an expression of wish form is to nominate a trust rather than individuals. If you choose this option, setting up a suitable trust will involve legal advice and therefore costs, so you will need to be clear as to any advantages this may offer in your own personal circumstances.</p> \n<p>Also, money invested in the trust is taxed differently, and potentially the investments will be less tax-efficient than if the money were to remain in the pension. However, the trust offers greater levels of control than simply leaving your pension to someone else.”</p> \n<h2><strong>An investment strategy for heirs</strong></h2> \n<p>If your top priority is to preserve your retirement fund so future generations can benefit, it’s worth taking a fresh look at where your money is invested. </p> \n<p>Usually you would scale back exposure to riskier investments, such as shares, and switch them to less volatile assets like cash or bonds as you reach retirement age.</p> \n<p>But if you are only interested in leaving your money to your beneficiaries, you might be looking for your investments to continue to grow over the long-term, perhaps for decades. This means you may be more comfortable leaving your money invested in riskier equities.</p> \n<h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2> \n<p> The next diary date is the adjustment to the tax charge on lump sums inherited where someone dies after age 75.

of progress in health</p>","byline":"Sarah Boseley","body":"<p>High-carbon lifestyles are desperately unhealthy, according to Hugh Montgomery, director of the UCL Institute for human health and performance and co-chair of the Lancet commission. </p> \n<p>Cutting red meat and dairy consumption would lead to a big saving in methane, which is 23 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide “from essentially belching cows. That saves a lot of strokes, heart disease, bowel cancer and so forth,” he said.</p> \n<p>Big savings are possible from “active transport” – more cycling and walking. Reductions in vehicle particulates improves respiratory health and reduces cardiovascular disease, as well as making people healthier and happier. <br /></p> \n<p>There are very big savings from people using more calories to move around, reducing obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular risks. The European commission says savings of well over €30-35bn (&pound;22-&pound;25bn) per year in healthcare costs could be made from quite modest reductions in greenhouse gases. </p> \n<p>Many cities in North America and Europe have started to go green. “All the surveys show that 80% of people want this. Let’s accelerate that. Let politicians catch up with the appetite of their citizens and mayors,” said Anthony Costello, director of the UCL Institute for global health and co-chair of the commission. </p> \n<p>He cited Melbourne which has set itself to become zero carbon, San Francisco, Chicago, Seattle, Minneapolis, Zermatt and Vancouver. “Bogota has set itself very aggressive targets for becoming low emission and investing hugely in buses and electric transport,” he said. </p> \n<p>In the UK, Newcastle, Leicester, Brighton, Bristol, Edinburgh and even London, which has introduced a lot more cycle pathways, are moving in the same direction. It’s not just about cycling, but also green infrastructure for flood mitigation and fresh water control, and having more parks for recreation with direct benefits on people’s health. There are also indirect benefits – trees buffer, wind and noise.</p> \n<p>The cost of air travel might have to rise, but one proposal is that one cheap family package holiday per year would be allowed. </p> \n<p>“The growth in air transport is short hop, short term leisure travel,” said Paul Ekin, professor of resources and environmental policy at UCL. “Stag parties in Barcelona over the weekend – that sort of thing might become quite a bit more expensive so people might think twice about doing that. But at the kind of carbon prices we’re looking at – $200 per ton perhaps by 2050 – that would not translate even to a doubling of current airfares. One mustn’t exaggerate, but it would become more expensive.” </p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434991658508/6a4a815d-45b7-4ab0-b371-0d5b985f596d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graham Turner for The Guardian","altText":"Stock.Cattle, near Flixton, Suffolk.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graham Turner for The Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-23T05:00:11Z","lastModified":"2015-06-23T05:10:27Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":42,"contributors":[{"name":"Sarah Boseley","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sarahboseley"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Climate change","Environment","Society","Health","Greenhouse gas emissions","Life and style","World news","The meat industry","Food"],"tags":[{"id":"environment/climate-change","webTitle":"Climate change"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"environment/carbon-emissions","webTitle":"Greenhouse gas emissions"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"environment/meat-industry","webTitle":"The meat industry"},{"id":"environment/food","webTitle":"Food"}],"section":{"id":"environment"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sarah Boseley","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sarahboseley"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"environment"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/23/eat-less-red-meat-and-cycle-more-for-your-and-the-planets-health","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a2m3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/environment/2015/jun/23/eat-less-red-meat-and-cycle-more-for-your-and-the-planets-health","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/23/eat-less-red-meat-and-cycle-more-for-your-and-the-planets-health"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434991658508/6a4a815d-45b7-4ab0-b371-0d5b985f596d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Methane given out by livestock is 23 times as potent a greenhouse gas as carbon dioxide.
