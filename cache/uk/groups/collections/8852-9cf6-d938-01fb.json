The blog says the Who had loaded in their equipment in the early hours of Sunday morning, but as their crew prepared the changeover after Paul Weller’s set finished, “we found someone had sabotaged the carefully tested audio connections for much of our gear. We’ve never seen that before, but we’re good at plugging things in, so all damage was repaired in time. Was it Mr Weller or Lionel, no way.

Our lighting guys have to programme a whole show with different lights than usual, run the rig from the stage … They had to think “out of the box” and make a new set just for our one show here – and try to be different than everyone else while supporting the music tastefully.”</p> \n<p>It also addressed some of the problems faced specifically by the Who, noting that “within a few songs, we knew something was wrong. The band were playing more than a little loose … Pete [Townshend] was growing angry right away.” The Who apparently suffered from echoes that affected their timing and synchronisation, with Townshend feeling “it was one of the very worst [shows] the band had ever played”.</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, the Who hailed “one of the most fervent audiences we’ve ever had”, and contrasted the crowd to that at their headline show in Hyde Park a few days earlier: “This crowd of twenty- to thirtysomethings was not waiting to be entertained; they were part OF the entertainment.”</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bd82cb3fe2beb847e0a4f0c637bce25fa1c9466e/0_68_2992_1800/2992.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":2992,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Anita Russo/REX Shutterstock/Anita Russo/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Glastonbury Festival, Britain - 28 Jun 2015<br>Mandatory Credit: Photo by Anita Russo/REX Shutterstock (4885440ad)\r\nThe Who\r\nGlastonbury Festival, Britain - 28 Jun 2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Anita Russo/REX Shutterstock/Anita Russo/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-10T07:42:37Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T08:15:34Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Guardian music","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/guardianmusic"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Glastonbury 2015","The Who","Music","Pop and rock","Pete Townshend","Glastonbury festival","Music festivals","Festivals","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/glastonbury-2015","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2015"},{"id":"music/who","webTitle":"The Who"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"music/petetownshend","webTitle":"Pete Townshend"},{"id":"music/glastonbury","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival"},{"id":"music/music-festivals","webTitle":"Music festivals"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Guardian music","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/guardianmusic"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jul/10/the-who-say-they-were-sabotaged-at-glastonbury","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ah3b","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jul/10/the-who-say-they-were-sabotaged-at-glastonbury","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/10/the-who-say-they-were-sabotaged-at-glastonbury"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/bd82cb3fe2beb847e0a4f0c637bce25fa1c9466e/0_68_2992_1800/2992.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":2992,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Who … Roger Daltrey and Pete Townshend dealing with the difficulties of Glastonbury.

It has been a source of some controversy among fans of the long-running show, but Capaldi said that shouldn’t be the case. “A lot has been made of the agenda change, but I really think people should applaud Melissa for taking this role and filling it so completely,” he said.<br /></p> \n<p>“What’s your opinion on having a female Doctor?” a woman dressed as the Matt Smith Doctor asked Moffat. “I think I’ve expressed myself about as clearly as I could in the context of the show” he said, indicating Gomez. </p> \n<p>“I will not be revealing myself as a man today,” Gomez added. Capaldi suggested a drag episode.</p> \n<p>It was Capaldi’s first time at San Diego Comic-Con, and he put his theatre training to use straight away. “I’ve never been in front of 7,000 people before in my life. I can’t hear them all, though, properly,” he said. The crowd responded accordingly. “All those years in pantomime,” he said.</p> \n<p>Practically no one moved an inch when the hall opened: most of the audience had been waiting outside for hours at least – days, in some cases – and simply packed a lunch and stayed all day to see Thursday’s lineup of panels. One man snoozed through the whole event.</p> \n<p>What’s the Doctor like, moderator <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2015/04/25/how-chris-hardwick-became-the-dick-clark-of-nerds/\">Chris Hardwick</a> asked Capaldi. Is he a nice guy? “He’s a laugh, he’s great-looking, he’s terrifically lithe for his age,” Capaldi responded. “We live in a world where everyeone’s so easy and everything’s so accessible, and the Doctor’s mysterious! He’s a Time Lord, not a ‘guy’. But if he was a guy, he’d have my face and he’d be really nice.”</p> \n<p>One of the fans took the microphone with a Muppet-style puppet, which she held up to the microphone. “Hello!” said Hardwick. “And what is your name?”</p> \n<p>“Puppet Laura,” responded the questioner.</p> \n<p>“That’s a very convincing human you’ve got with you,” Moffat said, who answered the deep-trivia question with a reference to the pre-hiatus version of the series, to scattered applause from the back of the room. “Ah, the sound of elderly fans clapping,” Moffat said. “It’s a little bit slower.”</p> \n<p>“Why do you think he’s so enamoured of humans?” Hardwick asked Capaldi of The Doctor.</p> \n<p>“Budgetary reasons,” Capaldi replied.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436480368901/0ca1a98e-03c4-4346-b778-e83767b3e2fa-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"MARIO ANZUONI/REUTERS","altText":"Peter Capaldi poses at Comic Con.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: MARIO ANZUONI/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T22:34:54Z","lastModified":"2015-07-10T01:35:47Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":65,"contributors":[{"name":"Sam Thielman","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/sam-thielman"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Doctor Who","Culture","Television","Television & radio","Comic-Con","Fantasy"],"tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/doctor-who","webTitle":"Doctor Who"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"culture/comic-con","webTitle":"Comic-Con"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/fantasy-tv","webTitle":"Fantasy"}],"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sam Thielman","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/sam-thielman"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"tv-and-radio"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/09/doctor-who-season-9-unveiled-comic-con","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4agqm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/09/doctor-who-season-9-unveiled-comic-con","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/09/doctor-who-season-9-unveiled-comic-con"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436480368901/0ca1a98e-03c4-4346-b778-e83767b3e2fa-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Peter Capaldi poses at Comic-Con.

His latest advance may have clinical benefits in brain rehabilitation, he predicts, but could also pave the way for “organic computers” - collectives of animal brains linked together to solve problems.</p> \n<p>“Essentially we created a super-brain,” he said. “A collective brain created from three monkey brains. Nobody has ever done that before.”</p> \n<p>He dismissed comparisons with science fiction plots, however, saying: “We’re conditioned by movies and Hollywood to think that everything related to science is dangerous and scary. These scary scenarios never crossed my mind and I’m the one doing the experiments.”</p> \n<p> Anders Sandberg, a neuroethics researcher at the University of Oxford, said the work was the most convincing demonstration yet that brains can be linked together in direct communication. “People have claimed digital telepathy in various cool demos, but it’s mostly been total hype,” he said. “I’m quite impressed by this. It has a high ‘gosh’ factor.”</p> \n<p>In the <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/srep10767\">first study</a>, scientists fitted three rhesus macaque monkeys with arrays that could record electrical activity from hundreds of neurons in the motor region of the brain.</p> \n<p>The monkeys learnt, independently, to control the 3D movements of an avatar arm shown on a digital display in front of them, just by imagining moving it. The monkeys were then given joint control of the arm, with each monkey able to control two out of three dimensions (for instance, along the x- and y-axis) and their activity made a 50% contribution to each. </p> \n<p>Although their brains were not directly wired together, the monkeys intuitively started to synchronise their brain activity, allowing them to move the arm collaboratively to a reach for a virtual ball on the screen.</p> \n<p>The system appeared to work, even if one of the three monkeys was temporarily distracted. “Even if one monkey dropped out in one trial, the brain net is resilient,” said Nicolelis. “Imagine if you had, not three, but a million. That would be extremely resilient.”</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"http://nature.com/articles/doi:10.1038/srep11869\">second paper</a>, also published in the journal Scientific Reports, the scientists directly linked the brains of rats together via two-way electrical connections that allowed the scientists to both deliver stimulus to neurons and read out electrical activity. </p> \n<p>In one experiment, an electrical impulse was delivered to the brain of one rat, and the other rats learnt to synchronise their brain activity, mimicking the first rat’s brain response. In a sense, they were experiencing what the first rat felt, second-hand.</p> \n<p>In another demonstration, pulses of stimulation that increased or decreased were delivered to the brains of individual rats, representing temperature and barometric pressure information. The rats were able to combine the information to produce a collective output that predicted an increased or decreased chance of rain. Rats scored better on this task when they were linked as a “brain net”, than when individual rats tried to combine the two pieces of initial information – temperature and pressure – to perform the simple calculation alone.</p> \n<p>The scientists said that in the future, the concept might be extended to produce neurally connected “swarms” of rats with collective intelligence.</p> \n<p>Nicolelis said that in the long-term the work could have “tremendous benefits” for brain rehabilitation. After suffering a stroke, for instance, language abilities might be able to be restored more quickly if a patient’s brain was retrained by directly synchronising with the language regions of the brain of a healthy person. In humans, the link could potentially be made non-invasively using electrodes on the scalp, however.</p> \n<p>But he added it was unlikely that humans would ever be able to directly share complex mental experiences. “You’re not going to share your emotions or personality to a brain-net,” he said. “These are not reducible to a digital algorithm. You can’t reproduce these individual human attributes.”</p> \n<p>Ultimately, people may also decide that wiring themselves up with others is not entirely desirable. “There may be special instances where you’d want a long-term connection with someone – like a married couple or a military platoon,” said Sandberg. “But there’s no guarantee that brain-to-brain interfaces will be a sensible thing in practice. There’s something to be said for neural privacy.”</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436458608183/5db38157-f823-45d6-9ea5-cfee26cc5c1f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Cinetext/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","altText":"JONATHAN DEL ARCOSTAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATIONPARAMOUNT26 September 1987CTV84479EntertainmentOrientation LandscapeStood half bodyborgalien","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Cinetext/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T16:26:53Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T23:01:22Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":195,"contributors":[{"name":"Hannah Devlin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/hannah-devlin"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Science","Neuroscience"],"tags":[{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"science/neuroscience","webTitle":"Neuroscience"}],"section":{"id":"science"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Hannah Devlin","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/hannah-devlin"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"science"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jul/09/monkey-brain-net-raises-prospect-of-human-brain-to-brain-connection","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aghg","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/science/2015/jul/09/monkey-brain-net-raises-prospect-of-human-brain-to-brain-connection","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/09/monkey-brain-net-raises-prospect-of-human-brain-to-brain-connection"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436458608183/5db38157-f823-45d6-9ea5-cfee26cc5c1f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Although science fiction hive minds are often terrifying, as The Borg in Star Trek, the scientists behind the “brain net” experiments believe it has many positive applications.

There seemed a lot of laughter at the screening I attended. Gasps that loud for a horror movie would mean raves were on the way. But this is a different genre. I can only say that whatever career notes MacFarlane has hit wrong recently, the Teds aren’t among them. This film, co-written by MacFarlane, Alec Sulkin and Wellesley Wild, is the uproarious and incorrect sequel to the stoner fantasy-satire <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2012/dec/13/best-films-ted-seth-macfarlane\">Ted</a>, from 2012. It is all about John, the irresponsible kidult guy whose emotional paralysis somehow magics into life his childhood teddy bear, which has grown into a potty-mouthed slacker, bong enthusiast and loyal best friend. Mark Wahlberg returns as John and MacFarlane again voices Ted, whose human-ursine marriage to Tami-Lynn (Jessica Barth) is under strain, as the government has blocked their attempts to adopt a child because Ted is not a real “person”. So the guys hire idealistic young lawyer Samantha L Jackson (Amanda Seyfried) to take Ted’s case to the highest court in the land to prove his essential humanity. Beginning with an audacious Cecil B DeMille pastiche over the opening credits, Ted 2 is a torrent of outrageous gags: uncompromisingly silly, cheerfully offensive, and funny.</p> \n<div>\n

weekend</a>.</p> \n<p>The 14 July fly-by will take place on the 50th anniversary of Mariner 4’s visit to Mars, which was America’s first successful planetary fly-by.</p> \n<p>New Horizons was launched on 19 January 2006, and has been travelling through space for the past nine years. Just over a year after launch, it passed Jupiter and used the giant world’s gravity to boost its velocity, as well as making scientific observations. This boost shortened the time to reach Pluto by years but last weekend, just 10 days before the encounter, the mission was suddenly cast into doubt. Contact was lost with the spacecraft for about 90 minutes. When communications were established, ground controllers found the spacecraft had entered “safe mode”, a low-power sleep designed to protect the spacecraft when something goes wrong.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jul/04/nasa-probe-new-horizons-pluto-charon\">Pluto: Nasa probe set for fly-past of frozen ‘dwarf planet’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The problem was diagnosed as an operator error, in which the ground staff had asked the spacecraft to do too many things at once, crashing the onboard computer. This will not happen during the fly-by itself, and science operations resumed on 7 July.</p> \n<p>At closest approach, New Horizons will be less than 12,500km above the dwarf planet’s icy surface, but 4.5bn kilometres from Earth. The radio connection is so weak at that distance that the data recorded by its instruments will take more than a year to trickle back. However, Nasa expects the first close-up pictures on 15 July.</p> \n<p><strong>Twitter:</strong> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drstuclark\" title=\"\">@DrStuClark</a></p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/03fb61754aaf547bf8ff6f5870a0a63a155d25c7/32_0_988_593/988.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":593,"width":988,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"NASA/Reuters","altText":"Image of Pluto taken by the New Horizons spacecraft from 8 million kilometres away.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: NASA/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-09T20:30:03Z","lastModified":"2015-07-09T23:01:01Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":58,"contributors":[{"name":"Stuart Clark","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/dr-stuart-clark"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Space","Nasa","Astronomy","Science"],"tags":[{"id":"science/space","webTitle":"Space"},{"id":"science/nasa","webTitle":"Nasa"},{"id":"science/astronomy","webTitle":"Astronomy"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"}],"section":{"id":"science"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stuart Clark","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/dr-stuart-clark"}}],"series":{"title":"Spacewatch","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/science/series/spacewatch"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"science"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/jul/09/nasa-new-horizons-spacecraft-pluto-flyby-probe","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4age3","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/science/2015/jul/09/nasa-new-horizons-spacecraft-pluto-flyby-probe","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/09/nasa-new-horizons-spacecraft-pluto-flyby-probe"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/03fb61754aaf547bf8ff6f5870a0a63a155d25c7/32_0_988_593/988.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":593,"width":988,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Image of Pluto taken by the New Horizons spacecraft from 8 million kilometres away.
