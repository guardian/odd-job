An 11-year-old from Stockport has run up a &pound;3,000 bill – sending his mother hugely overdrawn – after using Google Play to try to buy credits for his favourite online games.</p> \n<p>Like thousands of other parents, Penny Wrinch handed over her debit card details to allow her “highly trustworthy and technically savvy” son Nick to buy games for the family Google Nexus tablet. But she has since been left regretting the move after her bank account was emptied in just a short space of time.</p> \n<p>Nick used Google’s Play Store to buy apps and “in-app credits” to enable him to play various games. For several months his purchases went without a hitch, with him spending just a few pounds here and there – all agreed by his mother. But at some point hundreds of payments left her account over a period of just a few days. Fearing that hackers had got access to her bank account, Penny even cancelled her cards.</p> \n<p>In fact Nick had simply been trying – and seemingly failing – to buy credits to play football management game Top Eleven 2015 and strategy game Clash of Clans among others. Rather than the expected small number of payments of between &pound;1.49 and &pound;7.99 going out of Penny’s account, it would appear that after making a purchase the credits never reached Nick, causing him to click and click in vain to make them appear.</p> \n<p>On 2 March alone, 21 payments of &pound;3.99 and a further nine of &pound;1.49 disappeared from Penny’s account. The next day Nick tried again to buy the credits and the same thing happened – with 18 payments being made to Google. A week later 27 payments of between &pound;2.99 and &pound;6.99 were all debited.</p> \n<p>In total, Penny says &pound;3,000 was paid to Google Play over a two-month period, causing her huge financial difficulties. “The whole thing has been a nightmare. Payments bounced, including my credit card bill, and I have incurred bank charges as a result. Nick knows that these credits are bought, and are not free, but we suspect that when nothing happened he kept clicking ‘buy’, completely unaware that the money was leaving my account. I can’t believe that Google don’t have processes in place to stop this happening,” Penny says.</p> \n<p>Assuming that Play Store would realise the error and rectify it, Nick’s grandfather Tom contacted Google, only to be told the payments were correct and nothing could be done. Instead of the refund he says he was simply “invited to think happy thoughts”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The whole thing has been a nightmare. Payments bounced, including my credit card bill, and I have incurred bank charges</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Penny Wrinch</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The family are not the first people to find that hundreds of unauthorised payments to Google Play have left their accounts. In April it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/04/17/google_sued_unauthorized_pay_charges\" title=\"\">Susan Harvey of Orange County, California, was suing Google</a>, alleging that hackers exploited the ad giant’s inadequate security to run up thousands of dollars in charges on her account. She also accused Google of refusing to reimburse her for the 650 purchases, and then after backing down and agreeing to refund the missing money, not paying up at all.</p> \n<p>Penny and Nick’s case is interesting because it apparently differs from the previous tales in the media – mostly about children buying credits on their parents’ cards without their knowledge.</p> \n<p>The games industry typically offers its highly addictive products for free or at low cost, but invites users to buy credits or make monthly payments for the “enhanced” gaming experience. What are called “in-app purchases” have become a huge business, and some experts now predict that the international games market as a whole will be worth more than $100bn by 2017 – much of it paid by the parents of teenage boys (and quite a few girls, too).</p> \n<p>In 2013 <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/shortcuts/2013/mar/26/apples-in-app-game-charges-kids-bills\" title=\"\">policeman Doug Crossan made headlines</a> when he filed an official police complaint against his own 13-year-old son, Cameron, who had run up a &pound;3,700 bill playing games on his iPad, having made more than 300 purchases on various games. Doug made the report so that the matter could be dealt with as a fraud.</p> \n<p>A Google spokeswoman told Guardian Money that having looked at Nick and Penny’s case again, it would now be refunding the family – but it will not be refunding the bank charges incurred. It is still trying to work out what exactly happened.</p> \n<p>“We have always wanted to create a parent-friendly experience in Google Play and have developed tools to help parents prevent accidental or unwanted purchases. For example, you can use password protection so that a password needs to be entered each time a purchase is made.”</p> \n<p>She said Google takes all complaints very seriously and its policy is to investigate and refund these kinds of issues “promptly”. The company has a fraud protection policy that says it covers users against any unauthorised purchases.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> The Google Play Store support team is open from 8am-9pm every day on 0800 328 6081.</p> \n<h2>Other ways to pay</h2> \n<p>Many parents face the same dilemma – how much should they let their children buy things themselves over the internet, and should they be given a debit card for doing so?</p> \n<p>Handing over your own bank card is a huge risk, as many parents have discovered. Keeping the Google Play/iTunes password to yourself, and making sure you key it in unseen by your child, is one solution. But others argue that giving the child the responsibility of their own card is the way forward.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2014/nov/01/first-bank-accounts-teens-tweens\" title=\"\">Several banks offer under-18 accounts</a> which come with a debit card that in most, but not all, cases can be used to make online purchases. Last November Nationwide launched FlexOne – the building society’s first current account aimed at 11-17-year-olds, which comes with a contactless Visa debit card. At the time it made much of the fact that it could be used to make online purchases. It is also fee-free, meaning there can be no nasty surprises.</p> \n<p>The Lloyds Under 19s account similarly offers a Visa debit card that can be used online, likewise the Santander mini 1-2-3 account for under 18s.</p> \n<p>Check with other providers of junior accounts that their debit card can be used online. All of the above cards allow the user only to spend the balance in the account, and do not allow them to go overdrawn.</p> \n<p>Aside from the youth accounts offered by the high street players, there is also a growing number of other schemes and products aimed at children and teens: <a href=\"https://osper.com/\" title=\"\">Osper</a> is a service aimed at children aged eight to 18, and their parents, that consists of a prepaid MasterCard debit card and a mobile banking smartphone app. Parents load money on to their child’s Osper card account, while the app enables them to monitor transactions. There is also <a href=\"http://www.gohenry.co.uk/\" title=\"\">goHenry</a>, which is aimed at the same age group and comes with a prepaid Visa card and smartphone app.</p> \n<p>But there are charges: though free for the first year, Osper costs &pound;10 a year per card, while after a month’s free trial at goHenry, membership costs &pound;1.97 per child per month.</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432229142292/Penny-Wrinch-with-her-son-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Game over: Nick and Penny Wrinch couldn’t understand where the Google Play money went.

Tape your baby’s mouth shut?","standFirst":"All this time I thought you were doing something wrong, that you should have just walked instead, but what can you do? Tape your baby’s mouth shut?","byline":"Stuart Heritage","body":"<p>I’d like to use this space to offer a sincere and formal apology. If this column happens to be read by the parents of any crying babies I’ve ever shared public transport with, I want you to know that I’m sorry. I’m just profoundly sorry. All this time I thought you were doing something wrong. I thought you were bad parents, that your children were essentially feral and that, if you really needed to travel anywhere, you should have just walked. After all, I was trying to read a newspaper, or compose a hilarious tweet about EastEnders, or dumbly gaze out of the window like a cow obliviously trundling towards an abattoir. And that noise your kid was making, whatever that noise was – crying, screaming, gurgling with delight – stood in direct opposition to that.</p> \n<p>But now here I am, hat in hand, pleading forgiveness. I had no idea what you were going through. And now that I have a baby of my own, I’m quite rightly getting a taste of my own medicine.</p> \n<p>Last week, we took our son on a train for the very first time. We spent ages beforehand minimising the amount of damage we’d make – abandoning the pram in favour of a baby carrier, cramming all the assembled going-out paraphernalia into tiny satchels, deliberately picking a quiet train, and finding the most obscured seats in case he needed to breastfeed – and hoped against hope that he wouldn’t cry.</p> \n<p>Reader, he cried.</p> \n<p>In the big scheme of things, it wasn’t a particularly big cry. Perhaps a level two on the Heritage Junior distress scale; more than a whimper, but much less than the purple-faced apocalypse that he’s occasionally capable of bringing about. And yet even this comparatively muted outburst was enough to immediately send me into spasms of paranoia.</p> \n<p>I don’t know if other parents get this but, when my son started crying, I swear I could hear every tut, every sigh, every eye-roll happening across the entire train. I could feel the judgment radiating from the other passengers, and the disappointment whenever we didn’t get off at the next stop. It was a level of paranoia that I’ve only felt once before on a train, and that was when I only realised how antisocial it was to drunkenly eat a curry on public transport once I’d almost finished it.</p> \n<p>Here’s what I’m learning about being the parent of a baby who cries in public: it’s more stressful for us than it is for you. We weren’t always parents, so we know what you’re thinking. You’re thinking “God, what terrible parents”, which makes us think “God, everyone thinks we’re terrible parents”, and then we all find ourselves tied up in a never-ending negative feedback loop of crying and judging and clenched-colon embarrassment.</p> \n<p>You know what else I’m learning? Screw it. Because what can you do? Tape your baby’s mouth shut? Abandon him in a toilet? Take your phone out and rush up and down the carriage, showing everyone photographic proof of a time he behaved? Hardly. Little by little, my son is forcibly kicking the control freak out of me. There’s nothing like having an unreasonable three-month-old strapped to your front to let you know that you can’t always have everything your way.</p> \n<p>Babies cry. That’s just a thing that happens. The sun rises and sets, babies cry and arseholes will judge you for it. There’s nothing that any of us can do about that. Apart from trying to sit as far as away from the arseholes as possible. And apologising once you realise that you’re being an arsehole. So, again, sorry for that.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuheritage\" title=\"\"><em>@stuheritage</em></a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432126545953/Family-on-a-train-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Babies cry.

For two and a half years, our eyes have been on you, every morning, every evening, overnight, checking your damp hair after you’ve snuggled under your duvet, wiping every snotty tear and cuddling on the couch.</p> \n<p>After tomorrow, you’ll be going from being our little boy to our big boy, big brother, protector, sibling, sharer of our attention but not our love as our hearts expand to include our growing family. You started our little family, she will complete it.</p> \n<p>I still remember becoming a big sister myself: I was almost eight and so&nbsp;it was very different to the way it will be for you. Your father was 10 when his first sister came along, and neither of us know what it will be like for you.</p> \n<p>I remember how much I hated sharing the limelight, vowed that my brother ruined my birthday party when all the girls wanted to pass him round rather than play pass the parcel. My feelings culminated in a trip to A&amp;E after I pushed him over and he needed stitches to fix the cut above his eyebrow. I was nicer after that. For the most part.</p> \n<p>Your father has a kinder soul than I did back then and was more accommodating in his adjustments to his new family.</p> \n<p>I know that this will change you – for the better I hope, although it may not seem so at first when you get told “be careful”, “be kind”, “not right now”, “in a minute”. I’ve trawled through friend’s memories, online blogs, baby groups looking for advice on how to make this easy for you.</p> \n<p>You have already told me that you are too busy for a baby, and I can see that you are taking big steps forward into independence. I hope that when the dust settles, you will enjoy our new family experiences.</p> \n<p>This week, we have been spending time together doing things, you and I – just the two of us, me and my tiny sidekick. I am sad that it will no longer be just us, but I am also excited about what the future holds.</p> \n<p>And as I look back, what will I do differently this time? I’ve found, when I think about it, that I can’t remember what it was like when you arrived. Those first moments, I’m sure I sleep-walked through it all – I can’t quite remember how you were.</p> \n<p>It’s as if you’ve always been exactly as you are. You love to look at the photographs of yourself when you were small – the beautiful egocentricity of the toddler universe. I know this time round to take more video and feel glad to live in a time when I can soak up moments of film to drink in later when the memories fade.</p> \n<p>We had a rough start when you were born and so your sister’s birth has been organised in advance. I know you’ll be off gallivanting with your beloved granny, getting up to tricks of which I would most definitely disapprove, but I’ll be taking a minute to get an extra big hug in the morning.</p> \n<p>You rock my world, little dude, and will be holding your hand in mine to take the big jump forward to this new step.</p> \n<p>With all my love,</p> \n<p><em>Your mummy</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-23T05:44:09Z","lastModified":"2015-05-23T07:29:34Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Family","Parents and parenting","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"A letter to ...","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/aletterto"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/23/a-letter-to-my-son-on-the-eve-of-his-sisters-birth","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49vt4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/23/a-letter-to-my-son-on-the-eve-of-his-sisters-birth","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/23/a-letter-to-my-son-on-the-eve-of-his-sisters-birth"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"A letter to ..."},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Readers' recipe swap / Cider","rawTitle":"Cider","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/may/23/cider-recipes-grilled-salmon-cheesy-tear-share-bread-apple-fritters","title":"Readers’ recipe swap: Cider","trailText":"<strong>Readers’ Recipe Swap: </strong>Nothing says summer like a glass of cider.

From well-known French dishes to Italian staples, it seems that no dish is impervious to anglicising with a drop of cider ...</p> \n<p>Cider and cheddar fondue from LeftoverLiz, for example, seemed a world away from its French cousin, but with less fuss and, dare I say it, a touch more modern style. Then the apple fritters inspired by a Swiss hotel from Suzanne Anderegg had an added sour note from the dry cider and an extra crispness to the batter, too. Moreish doesn’t cover it. </p> \n<p>The same can be said for Alice Shields’ cider, cheese and onion tear-and-share bread, which also kept well for a couple of days, gently warmed in the oven just before serving. And I recommend making double the quantity of Marmaduke Scarlet’s slow-braised onions. Eat first with your Sunday roast, then use them in sandwiches along with the leftover meat. Midweek, an English-style risotto with pearl barley, ham and cider from Bryony Timms (served with a glass of cider on the side) was a warming summer supper.</p> \n<p>The winner, though, was so simple and effective that, once tried I’m certain it will become a constant in your summer repertoire. I cooked TwinnyDip’s marinated salmon under the grill twice this week, and am looking forward to giving it a go on the barbecue this weekend – as much of a crowd-pleaser as a glass of crisp cider on a rare sunny bank holiday.</p> \n<h2><strong>The winning recipe: cider and salt grilled salmon with fennel and courgette slaw</strong></h2> \n<p>This recipe requires fish with a strong, robust flavour that can withstand the slightly longer marinating time. Salmon and mackerel both work well.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/TwinnyDip\"><em>TwinnyDip</em></a><em>, via </em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/554a23e1e4b0919f0c7db37a\"><em>GuardianWitness</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br />4 salmon fillets, about 120–180g each<br />200ml cider (enough to cover the fish fillets)<br />1 tbsp salt<br />2 tsp caster sugar<br />200g fennel, finely sliced<br />200g courgette, cut lengthways into ribbons<br />2 tbsp olive oil<br />1 tbsp apple cider vinegar or lemon juice<br />Black pepper, to taste</p> \n<p>1 Put the fish fillets in a plastic container, skin-side up. Mix the cider, salt and caster sugar in a bowl. Pour it over the fillets, making sure they are sufficiently covered by the cider marinade. Cover and refrigerate for between 3 and 8 hours.</p> \n<p>2 In the meantime, prepare the slaw. Put the courgette in a colander over a bowl. Sprinkle with salt and mix well. Stand for 30 minutes, then drain and pat dry.</p> \n<p>3 Mix the fennel with the drained courgette, olive oil and cider vinegar. Season with black pepper, to taste, then chill, if not eating immediately.</p> \n<p>4 When you are ready to eat, discard the marinade, then pat the fish dry with kitchen towel. Cook under a hot grill/on a hot barbecue skin-side down for 8-10 minutes. Serve with the fennel and courgette slaw on the side.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cider, cheese and onion tear-and-share bread</strong></h2> \n<p>This loaf is the perfect accompaniment to soup or pasta. The cider adds a tartness that balances out the rich, creamy cheddar.<br /><em>Alice Shields, Lytham St Annes, L</em><em>ancashire</em></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 10-12</strong><br /><strong>For the dough</strong><br />400g strong white flour<br />100g rye flour<br />7g dried yeast<br />2 tsp salt<br />350ml cider</p> \n<p><strong> For the filling</strong><br />1 red onion, finely chopped<br />Olive oil <br />2 tbsp English mustard<br />100g mature cheddar cheese, grated<br /></p> \n<p>1 Place both the flours in a bowl and rub in the yeast with your fingertips. Add the salt and the cider, then knead for 5-10 minutes, until you have a smooth dough. Cover with a tea towel or clingfilm and leave to rise for around 1 hour, or until it has almost doubled in size.</p> \n<p>2 Meanwhile, soften the onions over a low heat, then set aside to cool.</p> \n<p>3 When the dough has risen, roll it into a long rectangle. Spread on the mustard, then sprinkle with the onions and most of the grated cheese. Roll the dough into a sausage shape and cut into 10-12 pieces.</p> \n<p>4 Transfer the rolls to an oiled baking tray, making sure you leave a slight gap between each one. Leave to prove again, for around 20 minutes, or until slightly risen.</p> \n<p>5 Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. When the rolls have risen, sprinkle with the remaining cheese and bake for around 20 minutes, or until golden on top.</p> \n<h2><strong>Apple cider fritters</strong></h2> \n<p>As a child, apple fritters had an almost legendary quality; they never failed to be mentioned in the story of my parents’ honeymoon. While camping in the Canadian Rockies, a bear stole their bacon, so they checked in to a Swiss hotel at Lake Louise where they were served the “best apple fritters in the world”.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/SuzanneAnderegg\"><em>Suzanne Anderegg</em></a><em>, via </em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/554a23e1e4b0919f0c7db37a\"><em>GuardianWitness</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6-8</strong><br />175g plain flour<br />125g cornflour<br />1 tsp baking powder<br />300-350ml cider<br />4 apples, cored and sliced into rings<br />Sunflower oil, for frying<br />Caster sugar and cinnamon, for sprinkling<br /></p> \n<p>1 Put the flour, cornflour and baking powder in a large bowl and stir together until it is blended and there are no lumps. Add the cider slowly and mix until a smooth batter is formed. Add the apple rings to the bowl and carefully stir until they are coated.</p> \n<p>2 Heat the oil in a saucepan on medium-high heat to 180C/350F, or until a breadcrumb quickly toasts when you drop it in. Cook the rings in batches by carefully placing 4 of the apple rings into the oil so that they do not overlap (or cook more if you are using a larger pan). Turn the apple rings over while they cook so they become golden brown all over. Remove each ring once cooked and place on some kitchen paper to drain and cool. Repeat with the rest of the apple rings.</p> \n<p>3 To serve, sprinkle the apple fritters with caster sugar and cinnamon, then eat while still warm.</p> \n<h2><strong>Somerset fondue</strong></h2> \n<p>I bought my fondue set in a French Monoprix in 1977. That was the year I had fondue at dinner parties for entree, main and dessert. On my return to the UK, I could neither afford nor easily source gruyere or emmental so instead, I made this very English version with mature Cheddar, dry cider and sherry.<br /><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/leftoverliz\"><em>LeftoverLiz</em></a><em>, via </em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/554a23e1e4b0919f0c7db37a\"><em>GuardianWitness</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 4<br /></strong>1 garlic clove<br />200ml dry cider<br />350g mature grated cheddar<br />Salt and black pepper<br />1 tbsp cornflour<br />1 tbsp sherry<br />1 tsp mustard<br />1 tbsp chopped chives</p> \n<p><strong>To serve<br /></strong>1 garlic baguette, sliced and each slice halved again<br />A selection of charcuterie<br />Pitted black and green olives</p> \n<p>1 Cut the garlic clove in half, dip in some salt and rub around the inside of a saucepan or fondue pan.

Transfer to an ovenproof baking dish and bake for 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Check the seasoning. Much of the liquid will have evaporated and the onions will have collapsed.</p> \n<p>3 Combine the breadcrumbs with the parmesan and a little salt and pepper. Sprinkle over the top and continue to bake for 15 minutes. Serve immediately.</p> \n<h2><strong>Pearl barley “risotto” with ham and cider</strong></h2> \n<p>I invented this dish having stumbled upon some leftover ham at Mum’s and some of my uncle’s exceedingly dry homebrew. It turns out cider makes a very tasty alternative to white wine and stock, with pearl barley instead of arborio rice. Sorry Italy.<br /><em>Bryony Timms, Iffley, Oxford</em></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 2</strong><br />1 onion, finely chopped<br />1 celery stick, finely chopped<br />Olive oil<br />1-2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />1 tsp fennel seeds (optional)<br />150g pearl barley <br />250ml dry cider<br />A handful of leftover cooked ham, torn into pieces<br />A handful of parmesan, grated</p> \n<p>1 Fry the onion and celery in the olive oil until soft, then add the crushed garlic and fennel seeds and cook for a minute or two, avoiding browning.</p> \n<p>2 Stir in the barley and fry for a minute. Pour over the cider so that it covers the barley, and turn the heat down. Allow the barley to cook, stirring frequently and making sure it doesn’t dry out, topping up with cider as needed.</p> \n<p>3 When the barley is cooked, after about 30 minutes, add the leftover ham and parmesan to taste, mixing well. Serve immediately. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"What's your favourite booze to cook with?\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/untitled_form_19_copy_12_copy_14\" title=\"COOK May 23 RRS\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432207232813/63e155a2-9f3b-443c-b243-5837a2e6fad6-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"The winning recipe: cider and salt grilled salmon with fennel and courgette slaw","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432207500520/9f6f155b-cdcb-4063-8bca-63f951fabf37-620x465.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":465,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Marmaduke Scarlet’s slow-cooked onions braised in cider...

The things I do for clients are very precise, with coloured walls and glass panels, so I just like to play in my garden.
