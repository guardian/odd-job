How many times have you thought ‘I might die here’? How many times have you thought ‘This might be the moment I fall’?”</p> \n<p>Robert replied: “Well, many times. But the thing is, as long as you’re not falling ... It’s just like a fucking warning, like you’re nearly falling ... I’m quite good at that, just saving my ass.”</p> \n<p>Laughing, Morgan said: “You see, you are a nutcase, but a brilliant nutcase. This world is full of brilliant explorers over the centuries, and you’re one of those guys. It’s mad to normal people like us, but to you, this is what you love doing, isn’t it?”</p> \n<p>Robert said: “I think if I wasn’t doing that kind of stuff, life would be boring. You know, I need to feel pretty much dead to feel like that I am fucking alive.”</p> \n<p>Morgan laughed again, and Reid said: “OK ... slightly more frank language at this time in the morning than we’re normally used to on Good Morning Britain so apologies for that.”</p> \n<p>Morgan, who was standing in for presenter Ben Shephard for the week, said: “Did he just use the ...? He did, didn’t he?”, to which Reid replied: “Well, I think we’ll just gloss over that, apologies.”</p> \n<p>The former CNN anchor continued: “Alain, you’re a tremendously brave guy.

There was therefore a clear breach [of the broadcasting code].”</p> \n<p>It decided not to take further action due to mitigating factors including the fact that Reid was quick to apologise to viewers after the second time the F-word was used. </p> \n<p>However, it added: “We did have concerns … that the effect of these apologies were lessened to a degree by the fact that Piers Morgan laughed after Alain Robert said ‘fucking’ for the second time and then further reacted, as ITV said ‘more humorously’.”</p> \n<p>ITV admitted that the pre-interview briefing given to Robert was not as good as if he had been in the London studio, adding that he was not “specifically warned not to use offensive language”.</p> \n<p>The broadcaster edited out the bad language in the one-hour timeshifted airing of the show, on ITV1+1, as well on the ITV Player service.<br /></p> \n<p>“Following our investigation, we found that ITV had taken appropriate steps to limit offence to viewers,” said a spokesman for Ofcom. “This included issuing several apologies broadcast immediately after the incident and at the end of the interview. As a result, we consider the matter resolved.”</p> \n<p> Meanwhile, Ofcom decided a Good Morning Britain interview featuring Nigel Farage was to be in breach of the broadcasting code. </p> \n<p>During the six-minute interview, Ukip leader Farage was asked about his chances of winning the Thanet South constituency in the runup to the election. </p> \n<p>Farage appeared before he was defeated by the Conservative candidate Craig Mackinlay. </p> \n<p>Ofcom looked at whether the programme had been impartial because it did not reflect the position of the other candidates. </p> \n<p>But it said that the item did not engage constituency reporting rules because there was only a “brief reference to Mr Farage’s constituency ... in the context of his position as a national party leader”. </p> \n<p>Ofcom has now given guidance to ITV to take care when including candidates in election programmes. </p> \n<p>A spokesperson said: “Ofcom investigated whether this programme was duly impartial and concluded that it did not break broadcasting rules. </p> \n<p>“While the interview with Mr Farage touched on his prospects of winning the Thanet South parliamentary constituency, without reflecting the position of other candidates, we found it didn’t engage the constituency reporting rules. </p> \n<p>“This was because the brief reference to Mr Farage’s constituency arose in the context of his position as a national party leader. </p> \n<p>“Also, the interview as a whole focused on wider policy issues at national level, rather than those in this constituency.” </p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/21/1429631326141/d37b2809-b932-435a-b6d1-b4a232aef556-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"ITV/Rex Shutterstock","altText":"Piers Morgan, who co-hosted ITV's Good Morning Britain last week, is understood to have been questioned by police over phone-hacking allegations.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: ITV/Rex Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T11:18:27Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T11:48:39Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":27,"contributors":[{"name":"Mark Sweney","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/marksweney"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["ITV channel","Television industry","Media","Breakfast TV","Television","Television & radio","Culture","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"media/itv1","webTitle":"ITV channel"},{"id":"media/television","webTitle":"Television industry"},{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/breakfast-tv","webTitle":"Breakfast TV"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Mark Sweney","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/marksweney"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jun/15/piers-morgan-good-morning-britain-swearing","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49nqt","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/2015/jun/15/piers-morgan-good-morning-britain-swearing","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jun/15/piers-morgan-good-morning-britain-swearing"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/21/1429631326141/d37b2809-b932-435a-b6d1-b4a232aef556-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Piers Morgan, who co-hosted ITV’s Good Morning Britain last week, is understood to have been questioned by police over phone-hacking allegations.

I&nbsp;have really strong feelings for him but our sex life is like the elephant in&nbsp;the&nbsp;room. </strong></p> \n<p>All that’s missing is communication, so&nbsp;initiate a frank conversation. First, put him at ease by letting him know you have strong feelings for him, and that you particularly enjoy sex at the beginning of each lovemaking session. Then ask if he’s noticed that the erotic spark between you seems to plateau for too long, and if he can help you to figure out why. A plateau phase is actually a normal aspect of the human sexual response cycle, but in your case&nbsp;it goes on for too long. Try to work together on a solution, and be brave enough to share your individual experiences. You might say: “At a certain point, I always start feeling anxious about whether or not you’re still enjoying it. Does the same thing happen to you?” Eventually you can become more specific: “Does something distract you? I’m wondering if there’s something I could do – or not do.” Choose your words carefully, and avoid being goal-oriented about orgasm. If possible, encourage each other to ask specifically for what you need, when you need it; that is the essence of good lovemaking.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</em></p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>private.lives@theguardian.com</em></a><em> (please don’t send attachments).</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113807737/7aea6e6f-cc2e-4a30-a094-f1dfb6cc1988-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty","altText":"I have really strong feelings for him but our sex life is like the elephant in the room.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T07:00:23Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T07:00:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":73,"contributors":[{"name":"Pamela Stephenson Connolly","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/pamelastephensonconnolly"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Sex","Relationships","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/relationships","webTitle":"Relationships"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Pamela Stephenson Connolly","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/pamelastephensonconnolly"}}],"series":{"title":"Sexual healing","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/sexualhealing"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/15/i-find-sex-with-my-boyfriend-dull","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49jdc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/15/i-find-sex-with-my-boyfriend-dull","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/15/i-find-sex-with-my-boyfriend-dull"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113807737/7aea6e6f-cc2e-4a30-a094-f1dfb6cc1988-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"I have really strong feelings for him but our sex life is like the elephant in the room (posed by models).

Get one? That’s a discussion that will have been going on in the country’s living rooms during and after the first episode of <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/humans\" title=\"\"><strong>Humans</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday). One meaning your own synthetic, or “synth”: a green-eyed humanoid robot.</p> \n<p>On the plus side it will clean and iron and then cook you a nice chicken chasseur for tea, freeing you up for all the good stuff you never find time for. It might even provide some kind of companionship. Plus there are potential upgrades, including adult ones, if you know what I’m saying.</p> \n<p>On the downside, there is a danger synths might make you, me, everyone redundant. They are already doing all the jobs people don’t really want to do, not just in the house, but street cleaning, handing out free newspapers, sex work etc (they are basically a bit like immigrants, I’m afraid). But it won’t be long before they’re doing the jobs you might want to do yourself – doctor, lawyer, politician, TV critic, footballer perhaps. The Singularity – when artificial intelligence overtakes human intelligence – isn’t far off. Also, returning to the basic domestic model, it might be a bit creepy having a machine that looks just like a person living in your house. It’s not good for the children either, it’ll mess with their heads. Plus you might be unlucky – like the Hawkins family – and get one, like Anita, that … who can think, and feel. Then things start to get really complicated.</p> \n<p>One of the beauties of Humans is that, like Charlie Brooker’s <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/black-mirror\" title=\"\">Black Mirror</a>, it really isn’t such a big leap, or ask. Only last week there was a story about Ocado creating an army of humanoids with artificial intelligence. The online supermarket robots might not be as pretty as Gemma Chan, who plays Anita (very convincing as a semi-humanoid), but this stuff is happening. Tellingly, Humans is set not some time in the future, but some time around now. It’s sci-fi for the non sci-fi fan, sci-fi that has more than a foot in sci-fact.</p> \n<p>It’s also a clever, high-energy thriller. Written – actually adapted from a Swedish series – by Spooks writers Sam Vincent and Jonathan Brackley, it has some of that show’s breathless urgency and tachycardiac pace. There are more of these sentient synths about the place, in the woods, plus urban wastelands, hiding, running. They are seen as a threat, bad dudes are after them, darting them, bundling them into vans, taking them away to be wiped clean, rebooted, decommissioned, or abused. Actually, it’s too early, and too simplistic, to divide into good and bad. There’s a more complicated, more realistic, more interesting morality to Humans.</p> \n<p>So you’re sitting on the edge of your seat, but maybe you’re also resting your chin in your hand, as you ponder technology, intelligence, consciousness, humanity, who we are and how we live now, and so on. And maybe that discussion you have should be not would you get a synth, but <em>will</em> you? Me? Are you kidding? Of course I bloody will. Mmm, chicken chasseur.</p> \n<p>Can there really be 100 Lego bricks for every child, woman and man in the world, as revealed in <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/the-secret-world-of-lego\" title=\"\"><strong>The Secret World of Lego</strong></a> (Channel 4, Sunday)? Seven hundred billion bricks? By my calculations that would mean (for someone with average size feet) that approximately every other time you walked into a room bare-footed you’d step on a piece … yeah, so about right then.</p> \n<p>Head office, in the Danish village of Billund, is a secretive place where strange child-adults stick coloured bricks together, for their job. Secretive, until now; “Reputation Manager” Roar Rude Trangbaek has opened the doors and is showing us round, except for the product development area; as the camera approaches, the building’s shutters do their thing (shut).</p> \n<p>The cultishness of the company – or the fact that sugar isn’t allowed in the canteen – doesn’t put Justin off, a 23-year-old Afol (adult fan of Lego) from London from wanting to work there. Wanting to, and succeeding. The dream comes true! Of the thousands who apply, Justin is selected. And here he is, six months into the job. “It’s amazing, it’s this great family atmosphere, you feel like you’re part of something,” he says, smiling. There’s something slightly different about him, now he’s in, from before, when he was just a fan. I think Justin is lost, to Lego.</p> \n<p>Another interesting stat: in a couple of years the population of Minifigures will overtake humans … Hang on, this is beginning to feel like the other show. How long before Lego Minifigures will be able to think?</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434112822237/Not-such-a-big-leap---Gem-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Not such a big leap … Gemma Chan as 'synth' Anita with Sophie (Pixie Davies) in Humans.
