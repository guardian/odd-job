Now criminals in the UK have started to get their hands on jammers and are using them to break into cars.</p> \n<p>A recent incident caught on camera by a passerby at the Manchester Fort Shopping Park has highlighted just how easy it is to stop people being able to use their remote central locking car keys.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10101995353297906\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.facebook.com/video/embed?video_id=10101995353297906\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Carpark jamming captured by passerby Autumn DePoe-Hughes. (Needs sound)\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>These keys use radio waves to communicate with a receiver inside the car. The key sends a signal to the car with a unique identifier and a command to either lock or unlock the car. But the wireless communication, like any other radio usage, can be jammed.</p> \n<p>A device can be used to flood the radio spectrum used by the keys with interference, which stops the low-power system of the remote car keys from working.</p> \n<p>Many cars that use radio keys no longer have separate key locks for manual operation, so the jammer can stop a driver from either locking or unlocking their car using their key.</p> \n<p>As long as the owner doesn’t realise what’s going on, car thieves then have potentially a field of open cars to plunder.</p> \n<p>The incident in Manchester showed that an entire open car park can easily be covered by jammers.</p> \n<p>A spokesperson for Greater Manchester Police told the Guardian that “GMP is not aware of any reports from the public regarding the jamming of their car’s central locking frequency at Manchester Fort Shopping Park” and appealed for any victims to come forward.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56acbd519fad20d97e8864cd4a6b4fd0addbf76a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432307294108/ddeff2a4-9e96-4eef-a1a4-9e96144c39b2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"woman locking a car\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Those concerned are advised to make sure they check that their car door is locked.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Barry Gnyp/Getty Images/Uppercut RF</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In December last year, a 25-year-old man was convicted of using a signal jammer to break into cars in the Greater Manchester area. Michael Fennell used a signal jammer bought outside of the UK for just &pound;35 to target central Manchester car parks.</p> \n<p>The jammer was used to prevent victims from locking their cars without their knowledge. Fennell simply opened the doors leaving no trace of the intrusion and leaving victims unaware that they had been targeted.</p> \n<p>Judge David Hernandez jailed Fennell for eight months at Manchester Crown Court, saying at his sentencing: “These devices are becoming readily available – there needs to be a very clear message sent out to the public: if you commit an offence like this where you deliberately go out to target the property of other people, having bought a jammer, you will go to prison immediately.”</p> \n<p>More and more cars rely on wireless technology for security and operation. A popular feature called keyless entry, which simply requires the presence of a key near to or within a car to keep it unlocked and operational relies on a constant wireless signal that could be jammed.</p> \n<p>Car companies are aware of the possibility of these kinds of attacks. Vehicle theft is now the lowest it has been since 1968 and has dropped 70% in the last 10 years.</p> \n<p>A spokeswoman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said: “The automotive industry continues to work tirelessly to stay one step ahead of criminals by working closely with police, insurers and security experts.”</p> \n<p>“However, to ensure thefts continue to fall, it is crucial that authorities across the country have a unified approach to collect more detailed data about how vehicles are stolen, so that both manufactures and motorists are best placed to keep their vehicles secure.”</p> \n<p>For those worried about jammers, the advice is make sure your car is locked before walking away. Watch for the flash of lights and sounds that indicate the car has successfully locked all doors. Manually check that the door is locked and do not leave valuables in view inside the car.</p> \n<p>Those concerned that a jammer is being used within range of their car can also report the incident to the police and are advised not to leave their vehicle unattended.</p> \n<p><strong><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/22/uber-self-driving-car-pittsburgh\">Uber’s first self-driving car spotted in Pittsburgh</a></strong></p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432307770382/c4fb4238-ada4-48ee-a3ab-dc73369eac09-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graeme Robertson/Graeme Robertson","altText":"car park","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graeme Robertson/Graeme Robertson"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/22/1432307295372/ddeff2a4-9e96-4eef-a1a4-9e96144c39b2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Those concerned are advised to make sure they check that their car door is locked.

With workings. </p>","byline":"Alex Bellos","body":"<p>Guzzlers, how did you get on? </p> \n<p>Let me first restate the problem. Albert, Bernard and Cheryl became friends with Denise, and they wanted to know when her birthday is. Denise gave them a list of 20 possible dates.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1a7fdf2ed473d43cd018fdec8b0e6fc85f40d48f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432538073570/5e233bf2-d08f-4096-993c-8d21b2d1715e-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"denise\" width=\"456\" height=\"163\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>Denise then told Albert, Bernard and Cheryl separately the month, the day and the year of her birthday respectively.</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><em>Albert: I don’t know when Denise’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know.</em></p> \n <p><em>Bernard: I still don’t know when Denise’s birthday is, but I know that Cheryl still does not know.</em></p> \n <p><em>Cheryl: I still don’t know when Denise’s birthday is, but I know that Albert still does not know.</em></p> \n <p><em>Albert: Now I know when Denise’s birthday is.</em></p> \n <p><em>Bernard: Now I know too.</em></p> \n <p><em>Cheryl: Me too.</em></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong> So when is Denise’s birthday?</strong></p> \n<p>The solution: </p> \n<p>You solve this in the same way as you do the Cheryl problem. Each sentence gives you a clue as to what to eliminate. Yet the Denise problem is more involved, and pushes your brain to think in different directions. </p> \n<p>Let’s take it line by line:</p> \n<p><em>Albert: I don’t know when Denise’s birthday is, but I know that Bernard does not know.</em></p> \n<p>Albert has the month so of course he doesn’t know. But if he knows that Bernard doesn’t know, then he knows that Bernard does not have either 11 or 12, since these are the only numbers that appear only once in the selected birthdays. If Bernard had 11 or 12 he would know, and the date would either be 11 April 2003 or 12 June 2002. We can deduce therefore that Albert does not have June or April.</p> \n<p>Let’s eliminate June and April: this deletes five dates.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20ce6228087b661dfde2ea9df0f4ef12c03fe282\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432537345870/cb64b179-54c8-4514-8257-42319f0cd886-460x164.jpeg\" alt=\"denise problem\" width=\"460\" height=\"164\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Bernard: I still don’t know when Denise’s birthday is, but I know that Cheryl still does not know.</em><br /></p> \n<p>Bernard has a number. If that number appears only once in the remaining dates then we can eliminate it, since a unique number would mean he knows the answer, but he doesn’t. The numbers 15 and 17 appear only once, so we can strike them out: that’s 15 May 2001 and 17 Feb 2001.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6b9fc9e219a9acc5a14980ff89e93cff6fb7c56\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432537417676/14a857f3-abe3-459f-b309-23a14fb63702-460x172.jpeg\" alt=\"denise\" width=\"460\" height=\"172\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p>But Bernard also knows that Cheryl doesn’t know. The only way Cheryl could know is if she has 2001, since there is only one 2001 option left. So Bernard does not have 13, and we can eliminate its two remaining appearances: 13 March 2001 and 13 Jan 2003.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"be40c5fb9092bd2e2ca66b267aae5d9b8fd7d35c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432537507428/3e9de3b7-1c0a-4311-ac64-a3e923b656fc-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"denise\" width=\"452\" height=\"171\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n</figure> \n<p><em>Cheryl: I still don’t know when Denise’s birthday is, but I know that Albert still does not know.</em><br /></p> \n<p>Cheryl not knowing when the birthday is does not provide us with new information, but if she knows Albert still doesn’t know, then Albert cannot have a month that appears only once in the remaining options.

The same word is repeated four times, in quotes from reputable American publications. You can understand why British publishers might want to exploit this. Still, I’ll be the judge of that, I thought, and then started on this odd and most extraordinary book.</p> \n<p>It begins in New Jersey, in roughly contemporary times (evidence suggests the mid to late 90s), with a narrator who sounds like <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2013/dec/20/the-code-of-woosters-pg-wodehouse-comfort-reading\">Bertie Wooster</a>, being awakened by his valet, Jeeves. The narrator, we quickly learn, is Jewish. He is staying with his aunt and uncle, for reasons, we learn later, of personal failure. He is a novelist who, after some success with his first book, has now been barren for six years. He has a penchant for Anglicisms, a weakness for English spelling (which he says he is too cowardly to reproduce in his writing), and a keen love of literature from this side of the pond, particularly favouring <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2000/mar/30/news.obituaries\">Anthony Powell</a> and, of course, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/pgwodehouse\">PG Wodehouse</a>.</p> \n<p>It is not as easy as it looks to pay decent homage to the man’s style. Sometimes even Wodehouse could look like a semi-exhausted imitator of himself, and that should be warning enough. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/sebastianfaulks\">Sebastian Faulks</a> called his own attempt, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/nov/06/jeeves-wedding-bells-sebastian-faulks-review\"><em>Jeeves and the Wedding Bells</em></a>, “a nostalgic variation”, but even after a year and a half, the memory of all the jarring notes in both tone and plot make me wish I had never read it.</p> \n<p>However, <em>Wake Up, Sir!</em> is another matter entirely. For a start, there is the question of style. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/24/jonathan-ames-american-writer-bored-to-death-interview\">Jonathan Ames</a> has an almost freakish gift for Wodehousian apercus that PG himself never uttered, as far as I know. A woman has “copper, wiry hair that had a life of its own and not a very pleasant life at that”. When the narrator, Alan Blair, is punched by the enraged boyfriend of a woman he has unwisely solicited, he notes later in the mirror that his nose had moved from left to right, “like the English sentence”. As for Jeeves, in an interview between Blair and his valet-to-be, after Blair has expressed surprise at the name, Jeeves replies: “I can appreciate, Sir, your reaction. I imagine you are making reference to the character Jeeves in the novels and stories of PG Wodehouse.” This is audacity of a high order. The plot then involves reworkings of the old Bertie-has-to-steal-something-from-a-country-house-in-the-dead-of-night trope, allowing the reader familiar with Wodehouse to tick off the (often quite subtle) nods to moments in his work.</p> \n<p>After a shortish while, though, you realise that much more is going on than mere cheek – superbly executed though that is. Blair is an alcoholic (huge intake, blackouts, the works) who also has to cope with other failures and anxieties, and Jeeves, although this is never pointed out, is a figment of his imagination: his conscience and his salve, both his loneliness and his respite from loneliness, internally embodied. In which case the word “hilarious” seems inadequate. The novel is extremely funny but it is also sad and poignant, and almost incredibly clever. Pouring the inner voice of the self-tormenting, sexually frustrated Jewish writer into the Woosterish mould is a great trick; and it’s also why you don’t have to be a Wodehouse fan to enjoy the book.</p> \n<p>Many people have noted how they turn to Wodehouse for solace in troubled times; Blair and Ames have gone a step further. There’s also the intriguing possibility that the book itself is a dream, or a dream within a dream – hence the title. (They are also the opening and closing words of the novel.) The real mystery, though, is how it took so long – more than a decade – to get a British publisher. Did they think, perhaps, that Wodehouse fans would be offended, or wouldn’t get it? If so, it was an unworthy thought. Thank goodness it is finally here.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> To order <em>Wake Up, Sir! </em>for &pound;7.19 (RRP &pound;8.99) go to <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/286687/\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

The Conservative stance on immigration alone may be enough to put many voters off – remember the 2013 “<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-23489925\">Go home or face arrest</a>” posters?

Mohammed Amin, chairman of the Conservative Muslim Forum, might have played a role. He gave canvassers something akin to etiquette lessons on how to treat BAME voters before letting them loose on the streets.</p> \n<p>“In the run up to the election we were in on the ground, canvassing in key marginal seats,” he says. “Sometimes the candidates would have us canvassing randomly and in certain cases the candidates would send us out to specifically canvass ethnic minority voters.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/24/one-million-minority-ethnic-votes-helped-tories-no-10\">One million minority ethnic votes helped Tories to No 10, thinktank finds</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Amin explained to the canvassers that it “helps” if women dress modestly when approaching Muslim voters, and if they were speaking to Muslim women, they should never “stick their hand out expecting it to be shaken”.</p> \n<p>“If the woman offers her hand to be shaken, obviously, by all means, shake it, but little things like that make a difference,” he told them.</p> \n<p>But the biggest message Amin wanted to spread was about using inclusive language – perhaps something the Tories needed a reminder of after former Conservative adviser Derek Laud damned the party earlier this year as being “<a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-party-is-still-racist-says-a-former-adviser-derek-laud-9985757.html\">the ultimate racists because they deal in stereotypes</a>”.</p> \n<p>“For many years Conservative politicians, and indeed others, have used phrases like ‘your values are the same as our values’, which sound positive,” says Amin, “but, if you think about it, they are actually creating a barrier between ‘you’ and ‘us’.”</p> \n<p>Amin believes Muslim voters are “natural Conservatives” due to their mutual focus on business, family and faith. The figures show that there was highest support for the Tories from Asian voters, compared with other ethnic minorities, although he is adamant that other BAME voters would be just as well suited to Conservative policies.</p> \n<p>“There’s no reason why people from black, Afro-Caribbean backgrounds should have any different attitudes. They’re often very socially conservative and they believe you should stand on your own two feet,” he says.</p> \n<p>Labour still holds on to 52% of the BAME vote, and while the Tories do seem to be on an upward trajectory, they have still got a long way to go. Amin’s long-term goal is to make BAME Conservatism “completely normal” and to set the intolerance associated with the party firmly in the past. We’ll find out in five years if he succeeds.</p>","section":"Politics","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432573798269/c5c17f9d-fd00-4c92-a874-f5b38e0e2ca2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrew Parsons/REX Shutterstock","altText":"David Cameron in a mosque","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andrew Parsons/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-25T17:36:08Z","lastModified":"2015-05-25T23:00:31Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":230,"contributors":[{"name":"Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/charlie-brinkhurst-cuff"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Conservatives","Politics","General election 2015"],"tags":[{"id":"politics/conservatives","webTitle":"Conservatives"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"politics/general-election-2015","webTitle":"General election 2015"}],"section":{"id":"politics"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/charlie-brinkhurst-cuff"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"politics"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/shortcuts/2015/may/25/why-are-so-many-black-asian-voters-backing-tories","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497z4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/politics/shortcuts/2015/may/25/why-are-so-many-black-asian-voters-backing-tories","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/shortcuts/2015/may/25/why-are-so-many-black-asian-voters-backing-tories"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432573798269/c5c17f9d-fd00-4c92-a874-f5b38e0e2ca2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Cameron talking to Muslim women at a mosque in Manchester in 2013.

According to industry sources, Amazon, which sells around 90% of all books online, and Penguin Random House are in dispute over the terms of a new contract for online sales that could grow into a full-blown row.</p> \n<p>Penguin Random House, which publishes 15,000 books a year across 250 imprints, is the last of the “big five” publishers to renew its contract with Amazon on selling titles online. Talks are said to be ongoing, although neither side would divulge details.</p> \n<p>Failure to reach a deal could result in Amazon freezing pre-orders or slowing down delivery of Penguin Random House titles, the hardball tactics that the online retailer deployed against Hachette last year. The bitter feud between Amazon and Hachette over the price of ebooks dragged on for more than six months and brought a wave of bad publicity for Amazon, with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/jul/25/writers-campaign-amazon-ebook-dispute-us-hachette\">hundreds of bestselling writers accusing the online retailer of hurting authors and misleading customers. </a>Hachette <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/aug/01/hachette-ebooks-sales-fall-amazon-dispute\">suffered a sharp drop in ebook sales</a> before the dispute was resolved last November, although it said Amazon’s “punitive” tactics were only partly to blame.</p> \n<p>Amazon’s spokesman, Tarek El-Hawary, declined to comment on rumours about its negotiations with Penguin Random House. “I can say that we have long-term deals in place already with the other four major publishers and we would accept any similar deal with Penguin Random House UK.” His remarks were first reported on <a href=\"http://recode.net/2015/05/22/amazons-u-k-contract-with-top-book-publisher-penguin-random-house-set-to-expire/\">recode.net</a>.</p> \n<p>Penguin Random House’s US spokeswoman, Claire von Schilling, sought to play down the negotiations. She said: “We are in continuous conversation with Amazon, with whom we have an ongoing business relationship. We have no intention whatsoever of ceasing to sell our print or digital titles on Amazon. We want our books to be accessible and available everywhere.” She denied there was any intention of ceasing to sell print or digital titles on Amazon.</p> \n<p>A dispute would be costly for both sides, as Penguin Random House titles are a mainstay of Amazon’s bestseller lists. Some industry watchers think the world’s largest publisher has bolstered its negotiating position, following the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/jul/28/penguin-random-house-merger-reactions\">merger of Penguin and Random House in 2013</a>.</p> \n<p>“With so many books in their repertoire comes tremendous negotiating power,” said Michael Kozlowski, the editor of <a href=\"http://goodereader.com/blog/digital-publishing/penguin-random-house-negotiating-a-new-contract-with-amazon\">goodereader.com</a>. “There are not many online digital booksellers that could stay viable if suddenly all of the books published by Penguin Random House were pulled.”</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/prh-uk-and-amazon-facing-terms-dispute\">According to the Bookseller</a> magazine, the dispute centres on the agency deals that were agreed between Amazon and the UK arms of international publishing houses in the wake of a 2012 <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2012/dec/14/european-commission-apple-ebook\">competition inquiry by the European Commission into ebook prices</a>. Under the agency pricing model, which Amazon has been trying to unpick, publishers set the consumer price of ebooks, while retailers take commission.</p> \n<p>Philip Jones, editor of the Bookseller, said it was helpful for the publisher that the dispute had flared up before the summer – well ahead of the peak pre-Christmas sales period. But he added: “I think we could be in for a prolonged period of public negotiation.” He said that Penguin Random House was in a “pretty good” position since the merger. “But Amazon – as we have seen from past experience – is not shy in pulling out the big guns.”</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432577168990/a88ec506-317e-46c1-acda-68dc82d10d16-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sarah Lee/the Guardian","altText":"Penguin books","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Sarah Lee/the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-25T18:08:38Z","lastModified":"2015-05-25T23:00:52Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Jennifer Rankin","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jennifer-rankin"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Books","Penguin","Random House","Booksellers","Amazon.com","Publishing","E-commerce","Culture","UK news"],"tags":[{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"books/penguin","webTitle":"Penguin"},{"id":"books/random-house","webTitle":"Random House"},{"id":"books/booksellers","webTitle":"Booksellers"},{"id":"technology/amazon","webTitle":"Amazon.com"},{"id":"books/publishing","webTitle":"Publishing"},{"id":"technology/efinance","webTitle":"E-commerce"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jennifer Rankin","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jennifer-rankin"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/may/25/amazon-and-penguin-random-house-said-to-be-in-dispute","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/497tk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/may/25/amazon-and-penguin-random-house-said-to-be-in-dispute","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/25/amazon-and-penguin-random-house-said-to-be-in-dispute"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/25/1432577168990/a88ec506-317e-46c1-acda-68dc82d10d16-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Penguin Random House is said to have a strong negotiating position with Amazon because of its huge catalogue of titles.
