The fore body, or Leader, first hits the asteroid with a kinetic impact, making a crater in it. The aft body, or Follower, then delivers an NED (nuclear explosive device) into the crater to break up the asteroid into small harmless pieces, eliminating the threat.</p> \n <p>This combination double-impact strategy requires only 1/20th the explosive force that would be necessary to shatter an asteroid with a direct nuclear impact.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Scepticism may still be a challenge for EADP’s campaign, with <a href=\"http://pando.com/2014/10/03/its-time-to-admit-that-bad-journalism-is-enabling-crowdfunding-scampaigns/\">Indiegogo having faced scrutiny in the last year</a> over the science behind some of its most prominent technology crowdfunding campaigns – <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/healbe-gobe-the-only-way-to-automatically-measure-calorie-intake\">Healbe</a>, <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ritot-the-first-projection-watch\">Ritot</a>, <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/nanoplug-the-world-s-first-invisible-hearing-aid\">Nanoplug</a>, <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/anonabox-the-tor-hardware-router\">Anonabox</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/tellspec-what-s-in-your-food\">TellSpec</a> being a few examples.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/mar/10/nasa-asteroids-data-hunter-dinosaurs-sxsw\">Nasa Asteroid Data Hunter contest hopes humans will outsmart dinosaurs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Caution about grand scientific claims on crowdfunding sites may be one reason why only 22 people have backed EADP’s asteroid defence project in its first 17 hours, at the time of writing</p> \n<p>Nasa has also turned to the crowd, but in a more practical way.

In this series, our writers answer some of the most common queries","byline":"SE Smith","body":"<p>We all like a good bit of sex. Or do we? We live in a culture criticised for being oversexualised, but it might also be described as one saturated in sex and the expectation that everyone loves sex – if you’re having it, you’re living the dream; if you’re not having it, you wish you were, and <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-09-04/mining-okcupids-data-reveals-how-we-date-now\" title=\"\">12 million OKCupid users</a> on a quest for love can’t be wrong. So what happens when you’re uninterested in sex?</p> \n<p>If that’s how you’d describe yourself, you’re likely lurking in the shadows, nervous to talk about what feels like a social aberration. However, not wanting sex isn’t terribly unusual. Relative silence on the subject reinforces the idea that there’s something wrong with people who don’t want to have sex, and it doesn’t help when people who speak up receive negative reactions from the society around them.</p> \n<p>Whether people are asexual, working through trauma, or simply taking a break from sex, there are plenty of reasons to be thinking about other things in life. In the vast majority of cases, not wanting to have sex isn’t evidence of a pathological problem that needs to be cured, and it’s nothing to be unhappy about. Opening up about the subject creates an environment where others can do the same, increasing awareness of the fact that sex isn’t the be-all and end-all for many people, and that’s perfectly all right. There’s plenty to go round for those who want it, and there’s no reason to shame those who don’t.</p> \n<p>In rare cases, not being interested in sex is a sign of something wrong, and it’s usually easy to spot when it’s an issue instead of a normal phase of life. Sometimes it indicates that a medication is causing side effects, or it’s a warning sign of an underlying illness. In these instances, not wanting to have sex can become a problem. It may make someone feel isolated, for example, or could indicate that a patient needs treatment or a medication adjustment.</p> \n<p>For those dealing with trauma, not wanting to have sex may be a symptom, but it’s still not a problem. Sexual or other traumas need to be handled carefully, and pushing people to have sex too soon will only compound their sense of isolation. Therapy, time and support are all useful – and it’s valid to take a break from sex. Even when people aren’t coping with trauma, sometimes they’re just focused on other things, like careers, raising children, or their own projects. Sex doesn’t carry the same weight for everyone.</p> \n<p>Many people who don’t want to have sex, though, are <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2012/aug/21/asexuality-always-existed-asexual\" title=\"\">asexual </a>– members of a large and complicated sexual orientation that includes a broad swath of people who aren’t interested in sex, for a variety of reasons, but are perfectly happy that way. It’s a facet of human sexuality, but it’s not as simple as “not wanting to have sex”. Imagine reducing sexual people to “people who want to have sex”!</p> \n<p>Look up “asexual” and you’ll encounter a myriad of definitions, but one of the most common is “people who don’t experience sexual attraction”. Asexual people may be involved in romantic (and sometimes even sexual) relationships, but they experience attraction by other measures, seeking out partners for different reasons. Yet the decision not to have sex is often used to invalidate their relationships – surely, you can’t call it a real relationship if no one’s having sex? It’s also used to invalidate their very orientation by people who think that sex is the pinnacle of human relationships, and who suggest that asexual people are lacking in some way or that they just haven’t found the right person – an argument oddly reminiscent of the notion that gay and lesbian people just need to stumble upon the right opposite-sex partner.</p> \n<p>For some asexual people, sex isn’t on the agenda, or it’s not a particularly important part of a relationship, and they seek out relationships with people who share their priorities and interests. Such relationships are sometimes dismissively referred to as friendships or deep platonic connections, but their nature is more complicated than that. It’s possible to experience romantic attraction without sexual interest, to have a marriage without sex, to establish a rich relationship in which sex plays a minimal or nonexistent role.</p> \n<p>Not wanting to have sex, in these cases, isn’t something that can be explained away. Much like sexual people, asexual people aren’t broken or wrong because of their orientation, and however they came about it – the “born this way” debate rages on – it’s valid, and can be empowering. Identifying with asexuality helps people find their communities, and to reach out to people who live like them.</p> \n<p>Estimates suggest that around <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/science/10/14/asexual.study/\" title=\"\">1% of the population identifies, or has identified, as asexual</a>, which means that if you’re not interested in sex, you’re not alone. You probably know someone else who feels the same way, and what matters is that you’re happy, not what other people think.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431439220634/Sex-shop-sign--008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'We live in a culture saturated in sex and the expectation that everyone loves sex.'

Traditionally, one trusted authority (usually a bank) holds an accurate ledger of how much money each customer has, and electronic transactions are made possible by rewriting the ledger of the sender and recipient simultaneously.</p> \n<p>But bitcoin, with no central body, instead shares all the information about who holds what amongst every computer running the software, to create a public ledger, the blockchain. The blockchain is so called because it records every transaction in the currency’s six-year history, grouped into a continuous chain of approximately 10-minute long transaction blocks. Every 10 minutes, when a complex mathematical problem is solved, a new block recording all the latest transactions is added and the blockchain. It means that every bitcoin transaction is public, and no single authority can prevent a transaction from taking place.</p> \n<p>The blockchain can also hold information other than just who spent what, however, and it is this feature which Nasdaq is using. The company will be creating “coloured coins”, appending special information to the blockchain indicating that a particular fraction of a particular bitcoin can be redeemed according to the terms written into it. That coloured coin can then be passed around just like a normal bitcoin, while preserving a record of who owns the asset it is linked to. </p> \n<p>It’s akin to sticking a note on to a pound coin that says “the owner of this coin also owns 1% of HotNewStartup Inc.” – except that the note can never be removed, the ownership of the coin is always public, and the message doesn’t have to fit on a postage stamp.</p> \n<p>Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive, said: “Utilising the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities. Once you cut the apron strings of need for the physical, the opportunities we can envision blockchain providing stand to benefit not only our clients, but the broader global capital markets.”</p> \n<p>Bitcoin remains in use as a currency, with companies such as bitcoin bank Coinbase <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/apr/29/bitcoin-coinbase-launches-in-uk\">growing rapidly</a>.

When I tell the jolly security man that we’re staying at the West Lakes Chalet Village, he raises his eyebrows and gives us an exaggerated, “Ooh, look at you, all high society,” look. Then he leans through the car window and gives my six-year-old son, George, an overenthusiastic squeeze of the cheek and points us to the chalets’ exclusive reception.</p> \n<p>The new lodging is an attempt to update the level of accommodation and the brand, and is aimed, according to the Butlin’s website, at “modern hard-working families” with an aim to “breathe new life into these classic holiday symbols” and take them from – wait for it – “Hi-de-Hi! to high-end”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efc59ba13fbd03d4fb64b15f0539413042ba8579\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431516954248/46c2eeeb-00f7-4a66-a75d-0f452a1ddb43-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A double room in one of the West Lakes chalets.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A double room at the West Lakes Chalet Village</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Butlin’s has spent &pound;16m on the 117 chalets and brought in parenting website Mumsnet as consultants. It may sound like an odd marriage, at least if you believe the stereotypes (north London yummy mummies in bed with an old-fashioned, budget-friendly holiday resort), yet more than 1,000 Mumsnetters responded to a Butlin’s survey, giving opinions on everything from what makes a perfect family break to the layout of the chalets.</p> \n<p>And there has clearly been a lot of thought put into the layout, both of the chalets and of the “village”, which is built around landscaped gardens and small lakes. Our four-berth chalet (the six- and eight-berths are similar, just bigger) had a twin and double room (the latter with an en suite bathroom with stylish charcoal tiles and power shower) and a large open-plan living/kitchen area that opened on to a balcony on the water’s edge.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"900ae994839ff6d3980642952322d0416c851f22\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431517054269/03f0a9ca-02cb-40ea-ad4a-5c1718c038e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Living area with Minehead Bay mural.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Living area with Minehead Bay mural</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The colour scheme of pale greys and muted blues and greens with splashes of brighter colour from the rug, dining chairs and wall mural of Minehead Bay is cheerful and breezy. The living area, with a high gabled ceiling, L-shaped sofa, white table and galley kitchen, is way better than functional – on a rainy day a family would have no problem being holed up in here for a few hours (chalets come with a jar of craft equipment and a game of Twister). Our four-berth feels big enough to entertain six people inside or even eight with the balcony in summer. This is an attractive proposition given how nondescript the catering is in the two (higher-end) Butlin’s restaurants we tried. Unsurprisingly food churned out on such a scale is uninspiring.</p> \n<p>The bedrooms are comfortable, too, with big plump beds. In fact, the only negative is the scratchy poly-cotton sheets that, combined with the central heating being on all night, meant both George and I kicked off the bedclothes in the middle of the night. Despite this, the new accommodation is a world away from the original, postwar chalets, which are still standing on the site. These look like dilapidated army barracks in comparison, and the Butlin’s website doesn’t even attempt to dress them up: it refers to them as “no frills Standard Apartments … complete with the basics you might need during your stay”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba6cc3b5a4f79c96b49e7d51b7e90f5812c29715\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431517307297/10d5e166-9d91-4a3c-9777-779642ff5661-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A garden area at West Lakes Chalet Village.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A garden area at West Lakes Chalet Village</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Butlin’s experience is still all about staying within the holiday park and mixing with fellow campers in the pubs, Waterworld and fun fair, and few guests seem to leave the complex. Minehead beach, a gorgeous expanse of golden sand dotted with rock pools, is directly opposite, but George and I seemed to be the only Butliners out enjoying the sunshine.</p> \n<p>The entertainment has come on since the days of the knobbly knees contests, mind. This summer, Diversity will be top of the bill at the evening show, which is included in the price. Not everything is all-inclusive though: activities such as the climbing wall, boat rides and even mini golf are extra. Crucially, our chalet felt like a nice place to hang out in – not just somewhere to crash in between the Butlin’s all-inclusive fun. It was so nice, in fact, that George commented: “I wish your flat was this nice, Dad.”</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Accommodation was provided by Butlin’s (0330 100 6648, </em><a href=\"http://www.butlins.com/\"><em>butlins.com</em></a><em>).

The story goes that the proto-Sabbath, the blues-rock band Earth, were rehearsing close to a cinema showing late-night horror films in a seedy part of Birmingham, when one of the band suggested that if people would pay money to watch scary films, then they might pay money to hear scary music. So guitarist Tony Iommi played some tritones, the so-called “<a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4952646.stm\">Devil’s interval</a>”, and Geezer Butler wrote some hokey Hammer Horror-style lyrics about the devil. The band had found their identity, a whole new genre of music was founded, and the rest was history.</p> \n<h2><strong>2. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_jDvEbT0hb8\">War Pigs</a></strong></h2> \n<p>Sabbath’s second album, Paranoid, was their big breakthough, with the hastily written title track storming the singles charts. But it’s this anti-war anthem that’s become one of the band’s most enduring standards. Though traces of their blues-rock origins remain, the combination of Iommi’s gut-punch staccato guitar and Butler’s doom-laden lyrics defined the early Sabbath sound, even if it was still too far ahead of its time for the critics of the day. To quote Butler: <em tabindex=\"-1\">“</em>Satan isn’t a spiritual thing, it’s warmongers. That’s who the real Satanists are, all these people who are running the banks and the world and trying to get the working class to fight the wars for them.” War Pigs was written in 1970, but some things don’t change.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3b6SGoN6dA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K3b6SGoN6dA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Black Sabbath – War Pigs\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>3. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9ldb4r7vP0\">After Forever</a></strong></h2> \n<p>Black Sabbath are sometimes seen as the originators of black metal, but in reality their religious views were Catholic rather than Satanic. This is one of the few songs that made that explicit, with lines like, “Could it be you’re afraid of what your friends might say if they knew you believed in God above”, and, “I think it was true it was people like you that crucified Christ.” It’s really an attack on atheism, though the line “Would you like to see the Pope on the end of a rope – do you think he’s a fool?” could easily be misconstrued, and it was.</p> \n<h2><strong>4. </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUm9GCLlCN4\">Sabbath Bloody Sabbath</a></h2> \n<p>Black Sabbath’s fifth album saw them step away from undiluted metal with their most varied album to date, but the title track remains one of metal’s greatest anthems. Musically it used the loud-quiet-loud formula a generation before American alternative rock was credited with inventing the idea, and Iommi uses half an album’s worth of riffs in a single song. Lyrically it’s one of the greatest songs ever written about being totally pissed off with everything, the line “Bog blast all of you” summing it all up.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9feBOmLbNI\">Symptom of the Universe</a></strong></h2> \n<p>There is a reason metal fans revere Iommi as one of the greatest guitarists of all. It’s not about the solos, though he could shred with the best of them when he wanted to. It’s about the riffs. Sabbath’s sixth album, 1975’s Sabotage, was the last in a string of peerless LPs, and after the sophisticated, layered approach of Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, this far heavier record put Iommi’s guitar centre stage. Symptom is the standout, and if the riff doesn’t make you want to play air-guitar, you’re already dead. And to demonstrate that they could still do light and shade, it goes all Jazz Odyssey at the end.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://open.spotify.com/user/guardianmusic/playlist/3s2H2v9BwgKPgWaIPIGur2\"> \n <iframe width=\"300\" height=\"380\" src=\"https://embed.spotify.com/?uri=spotify:user:guardianmusic:playlist:3s2H2v9BwgKPgWaIPIGur2\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>6. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR7hA2vAL6o\">Air Dance</a></strong></h2> \n<p>By the end of the 70s, Sabbath were losing their mojo. Drink and drugs were taking their toll, musical fashions were changing and the band were running out of ideas. The final album of their first spell with Ozzy Osbourne, 1978’s Never Say Die!, was a decidedly patchy affair. One of the album’s saving graces was this number, most unSabbath-like both musically and lyrically. It’s probably the only song they’ve ever done about an elderly former ballerina. There had been a jazz element in their music right from the early days – drummer Bill Ward’s background was in jazz, and he brought a swing to the band that most of their copyists missed – but here it’s bought to the fore, especially with Iommi’s fluid solo towards the end.</p> \n<h2><strong>7. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nd3ZiAwmLpM\">Children of the Sea</a></strong></h2> \n<p>The arrival of former Rainbow vocalist Ronnie James Dio, who replaced the increasingly unreliable Osbourne in 1980, completely revitalised the band. Not only was he a class act as a singer, but he was musicianly in a way Ozzy wasn’t, which completely changed the band’s approach to songwriting, placing a far stronger emphasis on vocal melody. Dio also took on the job of lyricist, and his mystical fantasy themes picked up where he left off with Rainbow, as this brooding epic, steeped in vaguely Lovecraftian imagery, shows.</p> \n<h2><strong>8. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoyaTGHweAo\">Heaven and Hell</a></strong></h2> \n<p>There are songs on the first album with Dio, 1980’s Heaven and Hell, that wouldn’t have sounded out of place on one of the preceding Rainbow albums, but the monstrous title track that forms the centrepiece of the record demonstrates just how perfectly the new frontman’s operatic melodrama fitted Sabbath’s doom-laden instrumentation. It’s got one of Iommi’s great riffs, married to the sort of vocal performance that shows why Dio, who died in 2010, is often regarded as one of the finest hard-rock vocalists of all time.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-og87crqsCE\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-og87crqsCE?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Black Sabbath – Heaven and Hell\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>9. </strong><strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKdICvAfV1o\">Glory Ride</a></strong></h2> \n<p>Dio’s first stint in the band ended in a clash of egos, and the band went through a revolving door of changing lineups including an ill-conceived collaboration with Deep Purple’s Ian Gillan and a blues-flavoured record with Glenn Hughes that was never intended to be released under the Sabbath name, as Iommi was the sole remaining original member at that point. Some stability returned with the arrival of the relatively unknown vocalist Tony Martin, and the albums he made with the band represent an often-overlooked chapter of the Sabbath story. This song from the first of those albums, The Eternal Idol, was a world away from War Pigs both musically and lyrically in its celebration of the Battle of Britain, but was very contemporary for the late 80s. </p> \n<h2><strong>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zl30htlXBt4\">Dear Father</a></strong></h2> \n<p>It all came full-circle with the 2013 reunion of three-quarters of the original band, including Osbourne but without drummer Bill Ward. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2013/jun/06/black-sabbath-13-review\">The resulting album, 13</a>, was far better than expected, a highlight being the closing track, with an evil-sounding growling riff and some exceptionally hard-hitting lyrics, even by Sabbath’s standards. Thirty years earlier, Dio’s first post-Sabbath solo album had cover artwork depicting a priest being tormented by a devil, causing a lot of controversy. A generation later, we know the reason that priest ended up in hell, and this song is all about why.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/18/1366323909368/Black-Sabbath-011.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Richard E  Aaron/Redferns","altText":"Black Sabbath","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Richard E  Aaron/Redferns"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T12:33:04Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T12:36:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":31,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Black Sabbath","Metal","Music","Pop and rock","Ozzy Osbourne","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/blacksabbath","webTitle":"Black Sabbath"},{"id":"music/metal","webTitle":"Metal"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"music/ozzyosbourne","webTitle":"Ozzy Osbourne"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"10 of the best","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/series/10-of-the-best"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2015/may/13/black-sabbath-10-of-the-best","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48p8a","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/musicblog/2015/may/13/black-sabbath-10-of-the-best","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/may/13/black-sabbath-10-of-the-best"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2013/4/18/1366323909368/Black-Sabbath-011.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Black Sabbath … Tony Iommi and Ozzy Osbourne on stage in the 1970s.
