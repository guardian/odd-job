Here are five that couldn’t possibly ... ahem ... go wrong.</p> \n<h2>Jane Bond</h2> \n<p>Anyone remember the rumours that Halle Berry might be getting her own spin-off 007 series before anyone had actually seen the horrorshow represented by 2002’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ml75GSIY8mw\">Die Another Day</a>? Frankly, producers Eon would have been better off giving the lead to Madonna’s innuendo-dispensing fencing instructor, but perhaps the idea deserves a revamp more than a decade on. Granted, the Bond series is currently on a high after the impressive critical and box-office success of 2012’s Skyfall, but in a world dominated by men wouldn’t a suave and irresistible female secret agent make a better undercover “blunt instrument” for MI6? James, much as we love him, has been a man out of time for decades: better to hand the mantle of saviour of Queen and country over to his cousin Jane (perhaps played by former Bond girl <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/rosamund-pike\">Rosamund Pike</a> as a souped-up version of her venomous Gone Girl character given free rein via a licence to kill from Her Majesty). </p> \n<h2>Blade Runner 2: Rachael’s Revenge</h2> \n<p>What better way to make the upcoming <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/feb/27/blade-runner-2-harrison-ford-ridley-scott-10-things-to-hope-for\">Denis Villeneuve-directed sequel</a> a genuinely thought-provoking proposition than to reverse the roles taken by Harrison Ford’s Rick Deckard and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/mar/26/blade-runner-sean-young-interview\">Sean Young</a>’s Rachael in the original film? The movie could open on a reimagination of the famous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Umc9ezAyJv0\">“Voight-Kampff test” scene</a> in which Deckard finally learns if he himself is a replicant. If only Young were not so ubiquitous by her absence from the big screen these days.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/may/15/mad-max-fury-roads-strong-women-wont-surprise-true-genre-fans\">Mad Max: Fury Road's strong women won't surprise true genre fans</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>Mad Maxine</h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.returnofkings.com/63036/why-you-should-not-go-see-mad-max-feminist-road\">According to “men’s rights” bloggers</a>, George Miller has already lost the entire male cinemagoing population of the western world by allowing Charlize Theron’s Imperator Furiosa to “bark orders” at Tom Hardy’s weary desert warrior in the brilliant Mad Max: Fury Road. And the Australian film-maker had already planned to centre the second instalment of his long-awaited reboot on the South African actor. So why not go one step further? The saga has a history of celebrating tough females, and you’d have to be truly crazy to survive as a lone woman in the saga’s dusty post-apocalyptic madhouse. </p> \n<h2>Thor</h2> \n<p>Marvel has already made the change in the comic books, revealing earlier this year that Thor’s long-term love interest <a href=\"http://uk.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/there-was-only-one-choice-for-female-thors-identity\">Jane Foster has become the new female Thor</a> after picking up the hammer Mjolnir and finding herself more worthy of it than the son of Odin himself. The poor old male Thor, meanwhile, has been forced to refer to himself as Thorr, which sounds rather like a dodgy Estonian metal band. Given that the big-screen version of the character struggled in his last solo outing, 2013’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2013/nov/03/thor-the-dark-world-review\">Thor: The Dark World</a>, perhaps the Disney-owned studio might do well to follow suit? It would certainly help make Taco Tuesday at Avengers Tower a bit less of a sausage fest.</p> \n<h2>Transformers: Fembots in disguise</h2> \n<p>Why do all movies about male robots tend to focus on blowing stuff up, while films about <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTv9AhCuSU4\">female robots</a> are always to a greater or lesser extent about sex? Let’s leave that discussion to another day, but imagine a combination of the two – sort of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2007/jul/27/actionandadventure.sciencefictionandfantasy\">Transformers</a> meets <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/video/2015/jan/23/ex-machina-video-review\">Ex Machina</a> – in which a race of giant sexy robots battles it out with another race of <em>really mean</em> giant sexy robots while paltry human beings look on in awe, and teenage boys (and girls) experience incredibly conflicting and disturbing sensual awakenings in the front row of the Beckenham Odeon. Bear with me: this couldn’t be worse than Michael Bay’s plan for another trilogy of synapse-smashing giant robot attack movies starring Mark Wahlberg. And any predictable “female lead washes the car-bot in skimpy clothing” scenes would suddenly get a whole lot more interesting.<br /></p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432226413221/956ad804-b79b-49b1-807b-f79bc0426ae4-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dave J Hogan/Getty Images","altText":"Andrea Riseborough.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-22T05:14:36Z","lastModified":"2015-05-22T06:13:16Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":14,"contributors":[{"name":"Ben Child","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/benchild"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Action and adventure","Women","Culture","James Bond","Blade Runner","Mad Max: Fury Road","Thor","Marvel","Gender","Superhero movies","Film"],"tags":[{"id":"film/actionandadventure","webTitle":"Action and adventure"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/women","webTitle":"Women"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"film/jamesbond","webTitle":"James Bond"},{"id":"film/blade-runner","webTitle":"Blade Runner"},{"id":"film/mad-max-fury-road","webTitle":"Mad Max: Fury Road"},{"id":"film/thor","webTitle":"Thor"},{"id":"culture/marvel","webTitle":"Marvel"},{"id":"world/gender","webTitle":"Gender"},{"id":"film/superhero-movies","webTitle":"Superhero movies"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ben Child","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/benchild"}}],"series":{"title":"Week in geek","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/series/week-in-geek"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/22/swapping-heroes-for-heroines-top-dollar-idea-movie-gender-swap","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/495jv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/may/22/swapping-heroes-for-heroines-top-dollar-idea-movie-gender-swap","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/22/swapping-heroes-for-heroines-top-dollar-idea-movie-gender-swap"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432226413221/956ad804-b79b-49b1-807b-f79bc0426ae4-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Money maker ...

If you actually take a few seconds to look at your students and imagine them doing this then you’ll be amazed at how easy recall can be.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2014/dec/01/top-tips-for-surviving-a-teaching-observation\">Top tips for surviving a teaching observation</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Not all names provide such obvious associations, so you may need to use your imagination. You need to draw on all of your memories of people you know with the same name or even of words that sound like the name. Some are more difficult than others, but I am yet to encounter a name in school that has been impossible to visualise in some way.”</p> \n<p>Bethany Eadie, a supply teacher in London, also uses the association method. “I link a sound, letter or rhyme in the name to an aspect of the child that is distinctive – the sillier the better,” she says. “Personality traits can be more helpful than looks. I kept forgetting one child’s name was Ismail, so I remembered it by saying to myself he was slow like a snail, as it rhymed with Ismail.”</p> \n<p>Taking the register is also a great memory aide, according to Eadie. “I didn’t realise how important doing the register is for name recall until I worked in schools where I didn’t do it and I couldn’t remember any names,” she says. “Teaching assistants or the class teacher will sometimes offer to do the register for you on placements, but I learned to insist that I do it. Hearing the names isn’t enough, you have to say them yourself. </p> \n<p>“When you call the names out, have the child repeat their name back to you rather than saying ‘here’ – this helps you check you’ve pronounced it correctly.

If you haven’t read the thread, it’s worth a read.</p> \n<p>Now down to business. As I said when I set the question there is no complicated maths involved. We tame the Vietnamese snake by a process of trial and error, making educated guesses as we go.</p> \n<p>Or, we write a simple computer programme to solve it for us. Which is what many of you did. It is arguably a more instructive puzzle for budding computer scientists than it is for budding arithmeticians.</p> \n<p>But for those of us who are old school pencil and paper folk:</p> \n<p>Rewrite the snake as an equation:</p> \n<p> a + (13b/c) + d + 12e – f – 11 + (gh/i)– 10 = 66</p> \n<p>We are trying to find a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h and i, which we know are some combination of the digits 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 9.</p> \n<p>Before we even look for a solution, consider the total number of ways we could fill in the snake: there are 362,880 possible combinations of the digits 1 to 9 placed in nine slots.</p> \n<p>We can tidy the equation to:</p> \n<p>a + (13b/c) + d + 12e – f +(gh/i) = 66 + 11 + 10 = 87</p> \n<p>or</p> \n<p>a + d – f + (13b/c) + 12e +(gh/i) = 87</p> \n<p>From here we can assume that b/c and gh/i will be whole numbers, and also that we don’t want 13b/c to be too big.</p> \n<p>Knowing this, we start plugging numbers in and seeing where we get to.</p> \n<p>There is more than one solution, so there are many difference guesses that will lead to the right number. (I didnt write a programme, but many of you did and from the comments it would seem that there are well over 100 solutions).</p> \n<p>The most intuitive answer offered yesterday I thought belonged to the contributor Brollachain. To keep the term 13b/c as small as we can, he let b = 2 and c = 1. </p> \n<p>Which gets us to</p> \n<p> a + d – f + 26 + 12e +(gh/i) = 87</p> \n<p>or</p> \n<p>a + d – f + 12e +(gh/i) = 61</p> \n<p>The numbers remaining are the digits from 3 to 9. They include the prime numbers 3, 5 and 7. As Brollachain recommends, lets get rid of them asap so they don’t complicate the other terms.</p> \n<p>Let a = 3, d = 5 and f = 7.</p> \n<p>Which leaves us with</p> \n<p>3 + 5 – 7 + 12e +(gh/i) = 61</p> \n<p>or</p> \n<p>12e +(gh/i) = 60</p> \n<p>The numbers remaining are 4,6,8,9.</p> \n<p>Playing around with these gets us</p> \n<p>e = 4</p> \n<p>g = 9</p> \n<p>h = 8</p> \n<p>i = 6</p> \n<p>48 + (72/6) = 48 +12 = 60</p> \n<p>There are some puzzles that you solve with a flash of insight, and some others – like this one – where there is no alternative but trial and error.</p> \n<p>Both kinds can be very satisfying to solve.</p> \n<p><em>On Monday I’ll be starting a regular puzzle column on the Guardian website.

So we asked a sneakerhead how to keep your trainers very white</p>","byline":"Morwenna Ferrier","body":"<p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/j2klive/\">J2K</a> is a grime MC from east London and member of Roll Deep. He’s also Jason Black, sneakerhead (he owns around 500 pairs of trainers) and creator of a very effective superhydrophobic shoe protection spray called ‘<a href=\"http://crepprotect.com/\">Crep Protect</a>’, which is fortunate as most of his 500 trainers are white. “White just eclipses every other trainer colour,” he reasons. “They’re least hassle and you can wear whatever colour you want with them.” He’s also a stickler for keeping them clean: “When I was younger, if they had a crease or a mark, I’d be like: I’m done with them. But obviously, if you’re low on money, that’s not always the best attitude to have.” Seeing as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/gallery/2015/may/21/10-best-white-trainers-sneakers-in-pictures\">white trainers</a> look set to continue to shape this summer’s shoescape, and money doesn’t grow on trees, here’s his quick guide to keeping your white trainers really, really white.</p> \n<ol> \n <li>First, you need your tools. A hard brush, a soft brush made from something like <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-horse-hair-large-shoe-brush/p1201980\">horse hair</a>, and a <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/john-lewis-ingenious-microfibre-cleaning-cloths-pack-of-2/p703104\">microfibre cloth</a>.</li> \n <li>You can use the hard brush on the mid-toe, the bit at the end, as it’s quite tough. If your trainers are suede or nubuck then you’ll need to scrub the upper part with a softer one. If they’re leather, you can use the hard brush all over. One of the worst things about white trainers is when the dye from jeans bleeds on to them. My trick is to Sellotape the bottom of the hem and it usually stops that happening. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></li> \n <li>Once you’ve scrubbed the whole trainer, wipe it down with a microfibre cloth.</li> \n <li>Laces are a lot easier. If you take them out, just rinse them with soap and water and go over them with a hairdryer.</li> \n <li>Creases are a lot harder to get out once they are there. I sometimes put reinforced plastic into the toebox so they keep their shape, but I can’t lie, it’s not very comfortable. So when you take them off, try and get a shoehorn into them quickly so they keep their shape. Once they’re clean, or if they are box fresh, spray them with crep protect and keep them in the box. You know, to stop dust depositing or whatever.</li> \n</ol>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432220171322/74e41e40-a40d-4027-bc5f-1c524c225c4e-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Whiter than white trainers","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-21T15:26:52Z","lastModified":"2015-05-21T22:25:51Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":102,"contributors":[{"name":"Morwenna Ferrier","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/10/15/1413394247883/Morwenna-Ferrier-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/morwennaferrier"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Fashion","Life and style","Men's fashion"],"tags":[{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"fashion/mens-fashion","webTitle":"Men's fashion"}],"section":{"id":"fashion"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Morwenna Ferrier","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/morwennaferrier"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"fashion"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2015/may/21/how-to-keep-your-white-trainers-white","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4958q","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/fashion/2015/may/21/how-to-keep-your-white-trainers-white","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/21/how-to-keep-your-white-trainers-white"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432220171322/74e41e40-a40d-4027-bc5f-1c524c225c4e-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Whiter than white trainers","credit":"Guardian","altText":"Whiter than white trainers","cleanCaption":"Whiter than white trainers"}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"White trainers"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Long tail / Dogs may have lived with humans for 30,000 years","rawTitle":"Dogs may have lived with humans for 30,000 years","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/may/21/dogs-may-have-lived-with-humans-30000-years","title":"Long tail: dogs may have lived with humans for 30,000 years","trailText":"New fossil evidence suggests dogs emerged as a separate species from wolves far earlier than scientists previously believed","standFirst":"<p>New fossil evidence suggests dogs emerged as a separate species from wolves far earlier than scientists previously believed</p>","byline":"Press Association","body":"<p>Domestic dogs may have a pedigree that dates back almost 40,000 years to when modern humans started colonising Europe and Asia, new research has shown. Previous studies suggested that the ancestors of modern-day dogs diverged from wolves no more than 16,000 years ago, after the last ice age. But new evidence – from a small bone found in a remote region of Siberia – indicates that the special relationship between man and dog is much older.</p> \n<p>Analysis of the 35,000-year-old rib bone fragment from the Taimyr peninsula showed that it belonged to the most recent common ancestor of modern wolves and dogs. DNA from the bone also allowed scientists to “recalibrate” the genetic clock used to estimate rates of evolutionary change. This is based on the rate at which species produce new mutations.</p> \n<p>The canine rate turned out to be slower than had previously been thought, pushing back the likely point in time when wolves and dogs diverged. In addition, modern Siberian huskies and Greenland sled dogs were found to share an unusually large number of genes with the ancient Taimyr wolf.</p> \n<p>Researcher Dr Love Dalen, from the Swedish Museum of Natural History, said: “Dogs may have been domesticated much earlier than is generally believed.” The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efdf794bc7614090e741ae131468dc2984f75621\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432238984672/56e758f4-9dbb-4dc4-a346-899de85f5dd4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Siberian huskies pulling a sled.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Siberian huskies pulling a sled.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In their paper, the scientists point out that there have been several reports of dog-like “canids” – the family that includes wolves and domestic dogs – up to 36,000 years old in the fossil record. There was also evidence that domesticated dogs may have accompanied early humans migrating from Asia to North America, possibly as long as 30,000 years ago.</p> \n<p>The researchers wrote: “Our results provide direct evidence for a longer timescale for the divergence of the dog and wolf lineages than previously assumed, and thus suggest that dogs may have originated much earlier than commonly accepted …</p> \n<p>“The initial divergence between the ancestors of dogs and grey wolves would not necessarily have had to coincide with domestication in the sense of selective breeding, since this human-mediated process could have occurred later or over an extended period of time.”</p> \n<p>Co-author Dr Pontus Skoglund, from Harvard Medical School, said: “The power of DNA can provide direct evidence that a Siberian husky you see walking down the street shares ancestry with a wolf that roamed northern Siberia 35,000 years ago. This wolf lived just a few thousand years after Neanderthals disappeared from Europe and modern humans started populating Europe and Asia.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432238867826/f6477a01-c076-4ae2-b4bd-cb0852602a59-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Reuters","altText":"Lower jawbone of the Taimyr wolf","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432238986247/56e758f4-9dbb-4dc4-a346-899de85f5dd4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Siberian huskies pulling a sled.
