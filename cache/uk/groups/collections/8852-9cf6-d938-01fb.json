link</p>","byline":"Agence France-Presse in Paris","body":"<p>New research has added to tentative evidence that eating chocolate in modest quantities may be good for the heart.<br /></p> \n<p>Scientists in Britain looked at data from nearly 21,000 people who filled out questionnaires about their lifestyle and had their health monitored for more than 11 years.</p> \n<p>Their average daily consumption was seven grams (0.25 ounces) of chocolate, ranging from none to 100g. </p> \n<p>The top fifth of chocolate-eaters were 12% less likely to develop heart disease and 23% less likely to suffer a stroke compared with the bottom fifth of consumers, the researchers found.</p> \n<p>The study, published in the British journal Heart, noted that most consumers of the confectionary ate milk chocolate, not dark chocolate which famously has a higher percentage of protective molecules called flavonoids.</p> \n<p>“This may indicate that not only flavonoids but also other compounds, possibly related to milk constituents such as calcium and fatty acids, may provide an explanation for the observed association,” it said.</p> \n<p>The team, headed by Phyo Myint of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, admitted the probe had limitations.</p> \n<p>The study was observational, meaning it could not show cause and effect, merely an association which may be circumstantial.</p> \n<p>Another question mark was to be found in “reverse causation”: participants who knew they had cardiovascular problems may have followed a healthier diet and eaten less chocolate.</p> \n<p>The team also did a review of other published studies, covering more than 130,000 people in total, and said they had found a similarly beneficial association with regular chocolate consumption.</p> \n<p>“Cumulative evidence suggests that higher chocolate intake is associated with a lower risk of future cardiovascular events,” it said.</p> \n<p>“There does not appear to be any evidence to say that chocolate should be avoided in those who are concerned about cardiovascular risk.”</p> \n<p>A couple of squares of chocolate are around 16g and an average bar of chocolate about 50g.</p> \n<p>Commentators not involved in the research were cautious, noting too much chocolate could lead to weight gain, which is bad for the heart.</p> \n<p>“You can’t draw a medical conclusion from this study,” said Arnaud Cocaul, a nutritionist at the Pitie Salpetriere hospital in Paris.</p> \n<p>“People who refrain from eating chocolate are not necessarily those who eat the most balanced diet.”</p> \n<p>Tim Chico, a cardiologist at the University of Sheffield in northern England, said in remarks to Britain’s Science Media Centre (SMC): “I would not advise my patients to increase their chocolate intake based on this research, particularly if they are overweight.”</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434414026465/55218b31-bff8-4aad-9f78-8bcb000a24f9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graham

But what should you choose? We’ve created a handy top five to guide you to a 90s nostalgia nirvana</p>","byline":"Eric Thurm","body":"<p>Rejoice, Scoobies: Buffy the Vampire Slayer is coming to ABC Family. “But it’s on Netflix!” you may cry. But watching 90s TV with lots of ridiculous ads and over a long period of time is the whole point, especially when ABC Family is practically inviting you to watch Buffy on an actual TV so you can use your laptop to write Spike-Xander slash fiction. Besides, the change in syndication networks is an opportunity to take a look back at the highlights of one of the best and most beloved shows of all time – Buffy might often feel a bit dated, but it’s in a charming way that doesn’t detract from enjoyment of the show. That means it’s also time to reignite some of the old Buffy fan debates. What’s the best season? (Three. Obviously). Angel or Spike? (Both, Spike if you have to choose). What are the best episodes? Thankfully, ABC Family itself is trying to answer this one – the network is kicking off its syndication run with a Fan Favorite Week before airing the series chronologically. Here are the ones they should choose:</p> \n<h2>Season one, episode seven - Angel</h2> \n<p>Look – early Buffy is important. And perhaps no episode more so than Angel, which finds Buffy discovering that the mysterious, brooding guy who likes her so much (and spends way too much time creeping around her at night) is actually a vampire with a soul. With most of Buffy’s initial anxiety and unwillingness to be a Slayer out of the way, the show is finally capable of delving into its characters complicated, centuries-long backstory, while also providing a great showcase for some of the teen angst that seeps out of the show once the main characters graduate high school. (Buffy is worried that Angel read her diary!) It’s one of the first serious showcases for Joyce Summers, allowing her to be threatened by a vampire while maintaining her firm denial about her daughter’s life. Overall, the episode is a look at a sweeter, simpler version of Buffy. It’s a good thing the series evolved, but sometimes it’s nice to look back and reminisce.</p> \n<h2>Season two, episode 14 – Innocence</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30102ca8ec0361cae9ef60787c5204a01409573d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434139075001/dbdd10d0-a3d6-428f-9c31-8efd1cf35745-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Joss Whedon loves Innocence\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joss Whedon loves Innocence</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie Simonds/BAFTA / Rex Featur/Jamie Simonds/BAFTA / Rex Featur</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A sad, necessary counterpoint to Angel, Whedon has repeatedly stated that Innocence is his favorite episode of Buffy, as well as the <a href=\"http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-04-28-buffy-top10_x.htm\">most important</a>. This makes sense – the episode, which kicks off maybe Buffy’s best run of episodes, is the show’s most seamless metaphoric integration of slaying and adolescence, and also its most emotionally painful. After Buffy and Angel sleep together, Angel loses his soul, reverting to his supremely evil Angelus persona and teaming up with Drusilla and then villainous Spike. There’s a fantastic element, of course, in Angelus’s terrifying, casual cruelty (and, admittedly, increased cool) and the monstrous Judge Buffy has to blow up with a rocket launcher at the end of the episode. But the heart of Innocence is an all-too common growing experience: After sleeping with her boyfriend, Buffy finds herself alone. And she discovers that he is, both literally and metaphorically, not the man she thought he was.</p> \n<h2>Season three, episode 13 – The Zeppo</h2> \n<p>The funniest, cleverest episode of Buffy, The Zeppo is a basically perfect spotlight for the often-underappreciated, totally normal Xander Harris. As a non-magical human, Xander has a difficult time justifying his presence in and explaining his contributions to the mystical battles that pad out most of the series, but The Zeppo shows off his personality, tactical intelligence and simple sense of commitment – a willingness to try and do the right thing, even without supernatural abilities. Nicholas Brendon’s constantly bemused, frightened performance allows him to anchor an episode in which he fights off a gang of undead jocks, saves Sunnydale High and loses his virginity. Meanwhile, the rest of the Scooby Gang fends off a world-class threat, allowing a whole separate episode to play out in the background. We only get bits and pieces of the other fight, but the straight-faced seriousness of Willow, Buffy and Angel allows the show to gently poke at itself in a way that doesn’t undermine anything else going forward.</p> \n<h2>Season four, episode 10 – Hush</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1c9c7675908dbffc90a58464121a5200b33d0bbf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434139218726/02786f7e-33e7-4431-ba1d-2dad728dce45-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Buffy didn't always have the best of times\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Buffy didn’t always have the best of times</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20 CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>No sound? No problem. Hush is a standout standalone episode of Buffy, allowing the creepy, buttoned-up gentlemen to steal the voices of everyone in Sunnydale. It’s one of the scariest episodes of the series, using the characters’ inability to communicate to divide them and make teamwork more difficult, in addition to perpetually redirecting viewer attention onto the mostly-unaccompanied visuals. But it also allows for a classic comic scene when Giles attempts to brief the Scoobies on the Gentlemen using an overhead projector. And that silence is mainly the centerpiece of an episode that displays many of the best aspects of mid-period Buffy, from Spike staying captive in Giles’ house to Xander and Anya’s spat-filled relationship (and Giles’ “orgasm friend”) to Willow’s burgeoning interest in campus witchcraft and the introduction of Tara. Season four is a bit uneven at times, but Hush is a Buffy fairytale – and that’s a genre that looks especially good on this genre-mashing series.</p> \n<h2>Season five, episode 16 – The Body</h2> \n<p>The best-remembered Buffy episodes tend to be off-format. The Zeppo focuses on one, somewhat secondary character, while Hush removes one of the major avenues for storytelling in sound. (One of the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VREnOZuC7qw\">other fan favorite episodes</a> goes perhaps a little too far in the opposite direction.) The Body is almost certainly the least Buffy-like episode of Buffy, and with good, sad reason – it’s about death. Not the kind of death from which someone can be magically retrieved, or raised as a quirky undead version of the same person. Just plain, ordinary death. When Buffy finds Joyce after suffering an aneurysm, the episode follows the smaller moments in the aftermath – Anya’s inability to understand human grieving, Xander’s pointless quest for magical revenge, and Willow’s anxiety over what to wear. Buffy briefly fights a vampire in the morgue at the end, signaling something of a return to the Buffy status quo, but with Joyce’s body in the room, it’s clear nothing will be the same again.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434138925603/84875726-680a-497d-8151-a41d7a518404-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"c.20thC.Fox/Everett / Rex Featur/c.20thC.Fox/Everett / Rex Featur","altText":"Sarah Michelle Gellar","cleanCredit":"Photograph: c.20thC.Fox/Everett / Rex Featur/c.20thC.Fox/Everett / Rex Featur"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434139076409/dbdd10d0-a3d6-428f-9c31-8efd1cf35745-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Joss Whedon loves Innocence Photograph: Jamie Simonds/BAFTA / Rex Featur/Jamie Simonds/BAFTA / Rex Featur","credit":"Jamie Simonds/BAFTA / Rex Featur/Jamie Simonds/BAFTA / Rex Featur","altText":"Joss Whedon loves Innocence","cleanCaption":"Joss Whedon loves Innocence","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jamie Simonds/BAFTA / Rex Featur/Jamie Simonds/BAFTA / Rex Featur"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434139218196/02786f7e-33e7-4431-ba1d-2dad728dce45-680x1020.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1020,"width":680,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Buffy didn’t always have the best of times Photograph: Allstar/20 CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","credit":"Allstar/20 CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar","altText":"Buffy didn't always have the best of times","cleanCaption":"Buffy didn’t always have the best of times","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Allstar/20 CENTURY FOX/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T14:28:25Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T18:31:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":377,"contributors":[{"name":"Eric Thurm","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/eric-thurm"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["US television","Television","Culture","Television & radio"],"tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/us-television","webTitle":"US television"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"}],"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Eric Thurm","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/eric-thurm"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"tv-and-radio"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/15/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-best-episodes","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49mny","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/15/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-best-episodes","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/15/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-best-episodes"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434138925603/84875726-680a-497d-8151-a41d7a518404-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sarah Michelle Gellar is Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

This sort of thing happens all the time.

Two months earlier,<a href=\"http://college.usatoday.com/2014/12/17/johns-hopkins-mistakenly-sends-welcome-e-mail-to-rejected-applicants/\"> Johns Hopkins University in the US did the same thing</a>.

My wife used to work as a web developer at a large charity, and quickly found herself inundated with the wills of total strangers, intended for the namesake lawyer who also worked there. And a friend of mine with a very similar name to his boss regularly receives all manner of sensitive emails dealing with the salaries or poor behaviour of his colleagues. It is to their eternal credit that both these people haven’t blackmailed their respective companies into oblivion. Yet.</p> \n<p>What to do if this happens to you? Several years ago, <a href=\"http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/30/ethics-of-e-mail-misfires-and-facebook-complications/?_r=0\">an ethicist told the New York Times</a> that the onus is on you to inform the sender if the contents of the email seem important or urgent. Or just email them to a newspaper. As the Bank of England now knows, that’s a pretty nifty way of making sure that it never happens again.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> This article was amended on 15 June 2015.

My mother had consulted other parents about whether or not the subject matter of JLP was appropriate for an eight-year-old.

Every word, yodel and yarble was memorised and mimicked. The artwork was mysterious enough that I needed to know more about this woman. With no internet or access to music videos on television, I knew the only way to see Alanis was to stay up late to watch her perform on the Juno awards. There she was, with what looked like wet hair, black leather pants and an oversized men’s white collared shirt, belting Ironic. Soon after, I began parting my hair in the middle and unbuttoning the wrists of whatever Oxford shirts I owned.

Just don’t hold your breath. </p> \n<p>Microsoft delivered a convincing press briefing at E3 2015, revealing a muscular line-up of exclusive titles and features. </p> \n<p>The show was stolen by the appearance of Minecraft on the company’s Hololens augmented reality (AR) hardware. On stage, Microsoft Studios manager Saxs Persson, showed how the block-building game can use the forthcoming device, which overlays computer graphics onto the real world to create a tabletop Minecraft landscape that players can model and interact with, through voice and touch commands. </p> \n<p>No release date was given for the tech or the game, but Microsoft made clear it has big plans for both mixed and virtual reality. Corporate vice president and Hololens head Kudo Tsunoda also announced that the company would be working with Valve, co-developer of the HTV Vive virtual reality headset, to make Windows 10 the de facto platform for virtual reality (VR) technologies on the PC. With this and the recent announcement that the Oculus Rift VR headset would be shipping with an Xbox One controller (together with the ability to play Xbox One games streamed via PC), it seems Microsoft is making a land grab for both the VR and AR sectors, while competitor Sony concentrates on its own virtual reality technology project, Morpheus.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe415b8848966ff32716e3486c744a85fcb43231\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434400611477/ef6ad7f0-0359-4913-9502-51ae3f2b2870-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Xbox E3 Rise of the Tomb Raider\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rise of the Tomb Raider artwork at Xbox’s press conference at E3.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Nelson/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Away from futuristic immersion platforms, Microsoft revealed a generous range of new titles, showing footage from Halo 5, Forza Motorsport 6 and Gears of War 4, as well as the latest Lara Croft adventure, Rise of the Tomb Raider, which will appear first on Xbox One this winter, getting an as-yet unknown headstart on PS4. From Software’s Dark Souls III, another much-anticipated sequel, was also shown for the first time, with a spring 2016 release date.</p> \n<p>As anticipated, legendary UK studio Rare revealed its latest title, Sea of Thieves, a typically bright and brash multiplayer pirating adventure, described by studio head Craig Duncan as “By far the most ambitious game that Rare has ever created.” Rare also has a collection of 30 of its classic titles such as Perfect Dark and Conker’s Bad Fur Day coming to Xbox One.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, Dean Hall, creator of cult open-world zombie title Day Z, popped up to show his latest project, Ion, an intriguing adventure based around deep space colonisation. Recore, a new title from Japanese game design legend Keiji Inafune and the team behind sci-fi classic Metroid Prime, is due in Spring 2016, and features two of this year’s seemingly on-trend elements: a female protagonist and a dog companion.</p> \n<p>There were some key service announcements too, not least limited backward compatibility with the Xbox 360. Classic titles will start showing up on Xbox One’s online store soon, but players who own the original versions will be able to download the digital versions for free. Xbox chief Phil Spencer showed the original Mass Effect running on Xbox One, where classic titles will be supported by new features like screenshot sharing and game streaming. </p> \n<p>Microsoft is also launching the Xbox One Preview service which allows players to download and try incomplete games before they are published. The concept is similar to Early Access on the PC games platform Steam. Players will be able to trial each game for free, then decide whether to commit to a purchase. Two titles Elite: Dangerous and Long Dark are already available and more are coming throughout the year.</p> \n<p>A large range of independent titles were shown to add some relief from a lot of shooting and explosions. Steve Gaynor of Fullbright showed its follow up to critically acclaimed exploration game Gone Home with Tacoma, and there was also a brief look at the fascinating Beyond Eyes, an adventure following a blind girl who must use touch to navigate the environment.</p> \n<p>It was a strong confident showing, then, with popular glances backward and some interesting platform exclusives. It will be up to Sony, holding its press conference later in the day, to up the ante, especially on exclusive titles. For the last two years the fight between Xbox One and PlayStation 4 has been built largely on technical differences and promise. Now, with plenty of titles looking to fully explore the capabilities of both sets of hardware, the real console war begins. </p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434393680711/b0bd7a2d-f3ee-468e-b057-d72b4fcd45df-620x372.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"public domain","altText":"Minecraft at the Xbox briefing","cleanCredit":"Photograph: public domain"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434400612917/ef6ad7f0-0359-4913-9502-51ae3f2b2870-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rise of the Tomb Raider artwork at Xbox’s press conference at E3.
