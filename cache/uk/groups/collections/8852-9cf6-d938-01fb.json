Yet, as the popularity and notoriety of Thrones on TV keeps on increasing, the question persists: why wasn’t it a series of movies?<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/09/trailer-watch-game-of-thrones-season-five-episode-10-mothers-mercy-final\">Trailer watch: Game of Thrones season five, episode 10 – Mother's Mercy</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The answer, according to George RR Martin himself, is the one that anyone who’s lugged one of the books to and fro for several weeks on their commute might have in mind already. “It took Peter Jackson three movies to make Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, and he still had to cut things,” Martin told <a href=\"http://www.sky.com/tv/show/the-south-bank-show\">The South Bank Show</a> last night. “It would take three movies for A Storm of Swords alone!”<br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/booksblog/2009/nov/13/hooked-on-george-rr-martin\">A Storm of Swords</a>, published in 2000, was an 82-chapter, 992-page monster that took up all of season three of the TV show and most of season four.<br /></p> \n<p> “And if you figure two movies for A Game of Thrones, and two for A Clash of Kings,” Martin went on, referring to the first two doorstoppers in his series, slightly flimsier at 704 and 768 pages respectively, “you’re already up to seven movies and you’re halfway through. Nobody’s going to commit to that – and, of course, they didn’t commit to that.”</p> \n<p> “The people I met from movies said one of two things. Some said, ‘Oh, we’ll just make the first movie! And after that’s a hit, we’ll make more.’ Well, of course, if you go down that route. then you have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2009/dec/16/philippullman-christianity\">Philip Pullman’s His Dark Materials</a>. Great fantasy, they made the first movie – didn’t do as well as they expected, and you’ll never see a second movie.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6f265fbf2597283272820636f226facda727119\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934700292/6bb671a0-c749-46ae-915a-a65f80332ce1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"“The whole movie would be about this exiled princess, and she gives birth to dragons.”\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“The whole movie would be about this exiled princess, and she gives birth to dragons.”</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/2015 Home Box Office Inc</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> Thrones relies on a combination of complex, gradually shifting power struggles and sudden, shocking developments. Both lend themselves to serialisation on television, where the set-ups can be detailed and the pay-offs can be doled out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/game-of-thrones-episode-by-episode\">week by week</a>, each of them becoming their own talking point rather than being bundled up into a film. But Martin said that, even in the best-case scenario, movies would mean not just losing the impact of most of his reveals, but losing some story points altogether.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/08/game-of-thrones-recap-season-five-episode-nine-the-dance-of-dragons\">Game of Thrones recap: season five, episode nine – The Dance of Dragons</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Alternatively, they said, ‘Well, yes, it’s true it’s too complex; it’s too big the way it is – but we have to find the central arc. And we’ve decided the central arc should be Jon Snow.’ So the whole movie would be about Jon Snow.</p> \n<p> “Or the central arc is Daenerys. The whole movie would be about this exiled princess, and she gives birth to dragons. That might be a good movie, and it might be interesting, but it wouldn’t be my story. My story is a combination of stuff.”</p> \n<p>Martin therefore made the decision to take his books to HBO, which <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2011/apr/15/game-of-thrones-hbo-sean-bean\">premiered the first season of Thrones in 2011</a>. “I didn’t need the money, so I had the power to say the sexiest word in Hollywood – no.”</p> \n<p>This does not mean, however, that there will never be a Thrones film. HBO’s president of programming, Michael Lombardo, isn’t keen: “When you start a series with our subscribers, the promise is that, for your HBO fee, we’re going to take you to the end of this,” he told <a href=\"http://www.ew.com/article/2015/03/11/game-thrones-end\">Entertainment Weekly in March</a>, adding that a movie would be “changing the rules. Now you have to pay $16 to see how your show ends.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce653ecbb83c8be065a04aaea90a612d768f159a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433935619319/5e41bd37-eef2-42ef-b4b4-2085ff4a8e0d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Littlefinger: The Movie, anyone?\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Littlefinger: The Movie, anyone?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO/ Helen Sloan/2015 Home Box Office Inc</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But George RR Martin has repeatedly dropped hints that, although it wasn’t right to begin the saga’s screen life in cinemas, ending it that way is his preferred option. “Sure, I love the idea,” he wrote on his blog earlier this year. “Why not? What fantasist would not love the idea of going out with an epic $100m feature film? And the recent success of the Imax experience [old episodes showing over Super Bowl weekend in January took $1.9m at the box office] shows that the audience is there for such a movie. If we build it, they will come.”</p> \n<p>“But will we build it?

But she eventually came to realise that the British writer would only sanction a final cut that cleaved tightly to her own famously clunky dialogue.</p> \n<p>“I didn’t want the story to be linear; I wanted it to begin at the end of the film, and for us to meet in the middle,” said Marcel. “So you start with the spanking, and you have these sort of flashes that go throughout the film … I wanted to take the inner goddess out, and all of Ana’s inner monologue … I wanted to remove a lot of the dialogue. I felt it could be a really sexy film if there wasn’t so much talking in it.</p> \n<p>“When I delivered that script was when I realised that all of them saying, ‘Yeah, absolutely this is what we want!’, and, ‘You can write anything you like and get crazy and artistic with it’ – that was utter, utter bullshit. Rightly so. Erika was like, ‘This isn’t what I want it to be, and I don’t think this is the film the fans are looking for …’ Ultimately, Erika did have all of the control.”</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-455416050__\n</div> \n<p>Reports prior to Fifty Shades of Grey’s February release alleged that James threatened to withdraw her support for the film unless her original dialogue was retained. Studio Universal hired the award-winning playwright of Closer and Dealer’s Choice, Patrick Marber, to hone Marcel’s James-sanctioned screenplay. But the novelist reportedly went through the final script and removed all Marber’s tinkerings, threatening to alert her fans on social media if she were challenged.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/feb/06/fifty-shades-of-grey-el-james-dialogue-sam-taylor-johnson\">Fifty Shades of grating teeth: EL James 'threatened boycott' of film if dialogue rewritten</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The author also <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/fifty-shades-grey-author-overruled-770424\">reportedly refused to allow a subtle change to the film’s denouement</a> in which Dakota Johnson’s Anastasia Steele was due to mutter the safe word “red” to Jamie Dornan’s kinky billionaire Christian Grey.

But, as the show’s cast has swelled, her significance has diminished. Her uncovering of institutional corruption in the prison was largely relegated to a B-plot last season, while the turf war between Red and Vee took prominence. Still, with Piper’s lover/antagonist Alex returning for season three – as a result of Piper having dobbed her in to her parole officer – you’d expect dandelion to have a bit more to do this time around. Thankfully, we’ll all be spared those long, dull conversations with her former fiance Larry (Jason Biggs) – he’s run off with her best friend Polly, <a href=\"http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/orange-is-the-new-black-jason-biggs-larry-leaving-season-3-1201437968/\">and won’t return this season</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>Friends</strong>: Alex (sometimes), Nikki, Red (sort of) </p> \n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: Alex (sometimes), Pennsatucky</p> \n<p><strong>Likelihood of getting beaten up in the showers?</strong> High</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9900a2a4c9ef5c4b569531ad76df762ac886cec2\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9900a2a4c9ef5c4b569531ad76df762ac886cec2/834_0_1317_1976/666.jpg\" alt=\"Read or dead: Kate Mulgrew as red\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Red’ or dead: Kate Mulgrew as Galina Reznikov.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jessica Miglio/Netflix</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Galina ‘Red’ Reznikov</strong></h2> \n<p>Red used to be the top dog in Litchfield: the prison’s head chef, and the person who could get you just about anything, from tampons to Twinkies. But her kitchen duties were handed to her rival Gloria after she was caught facilitating rogue guard Pornstache’s drug trade. Then her attempts to continue the smuggling service in the prison’s greenhouse initiated a feud with long-time rival Vee, culminating in Red receiving an almighty <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Lock+in+a+sock\">lock-in-a-socking</a>. Vee’s out of the picture now, having been run over by a prison truck driven by the absconding cancer patient Rosa in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L118MPZHog8\">one of the show’s most satisfying scenes</a>, meaning that Red has the all-clear to rebuild her empire, if she wants to. Will she make another play for the kitchen? Continue her illicit activities in the greenhouse? Or might she give up the game entirely and spent the rest of her sentence playing canasta with the Golden Girls? Matters are complicated somewhat by the fact that, back in the Bronx, the business she built with her husband has gone under without her knowing it.</p> \n<p><strong>Friends</strong>: The Golden Girls, Nicky</p> \n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: Whoever gets in her way, Vee (if she’s not dead)</p> \n<p><strong>Likelihood of getting beaten up in the showers?</strong> Minimal. You don’t want to make an enemy of Red.</p> \n<h2><strong>Dayanara ‘Daya’ Diaz </strong></h2> \n<p>A storyline drawn from the most exaggerated of telenovelas: Daya is in love with and carrying the child of one prison officer, Bennett, having claimed that another officer, Pornstache, was the father. Pornstache was arrested for that infraction, and Bennett and Daya’s relationship still remains a secret, but one that will surely come out at some point. Daya, let’s remember, wants Bennett to come clean about the child’s parentage, even though that means Bennett will probably spend time in the clink as a result. Complicated.</p> \n<p><strong>Friends</strong>: The Hispanic bloc – Aleida, Gloria, Maria, Marisol – and Bennett, of course</p> \n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: None really, now that Pornstache is out of the picture</p> \n<p><strong>Likelihood of getting beaten up in the showers? </strong>Slim to none</p> \n<h2><strong>Poussey Washington</strong></h2> \n<p>Another victim of Vee’s psychopathic tendencies, Poussey spent much of season two trying to convince the rest of her gang – Taystee, Black Cindy, Jeaney – that their new leader was up to no good, and ended up being beaten up and banished from the group for her troubles. With Vee gone she’s back in the fold, free to continue her bittersweet friendship with Taystee, whom she has the biggest of crushes on. Poor Poussey.</p> \n<p><strong>Friends</strong>: Taystee, Black Cindy, Jeaney </p> \n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: Unrequited love</p> \n<p><strong>Likelihood of getting beaten up in the showers?</strong> In season two, high; now, not so much</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c902cda2a31eb7cb93de2b236c6826253189fa13\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/c902cda2a31eb7cb93de2b236c6826253189fa13/959_78_1216_1826/666.jpg\" alt=\"Natasha Lyonne as Nicky\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Natasha Lyonne as Nicky.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Netflix/Everett/Rex_Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>Nicole ‘Nicky’ Nichols </strong></h2> \n<p>After struggling with addiction and the death of her friend Tricia in the first season, Nicky’s was a more cheerful story arc in the show’s second run as she competed with Big Boo over who could get the most notches in their respective bedposts. Things can turn on a dime in OITNB though, and Nicky’s decision to hide the heroin she stole from Vee in an air vent looks likely to bring her face to face with her addiction again in season three. Storm clouds ahead.</p> \n<p><strong>Friends</strong>: Red, Piper, Morello, Big Boo</p> \n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: Sweet lady skag</p> \n<p><strong>Likelihood of getting beaten up in the showers? </strong>Pretty high if Red gets wind of those drugs</p> \n<h2><strong>Tiffany ‘Pennsatucky’ Doggett</strong></h2> \n<p>A one-dimensional, white trash god-botherer with the worst teeth this side of Austin Powers, Pennsatucky was once OITNB’s most irritating character by a country mile. Yet, after receiving a monstrous beat-down from Piper, she received a pearly new set of gnashers and a new, softer demeanour in the show’s second season. She forged a sad, strange friendship with the flawed prison guard Healy in his Safe Space group, and – in one of the more unlikely developments in the show – became pally with Big Boo, and curious about the “counterculture”. As you do.</p> \n<p><strong>Friends</strong>: Big Boo, Healy</p> \n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: Piper, her former acolytes</p> \n<p><strong>Likelihood of getting beaten up in the showers?</strong> High. Despite all of the above, she’s still pretty annoying.</p> \n<h2><strong>Suzanne ‘Crazy Eyes’ Warren</strong></h2> \n<p>Crazy Eyes was one of OITNB’s breakout characters in its first season, offering a depiction of mental illness that felt far more layered and optimistic than much of what we see on TV. Which made it all the more difficult to watch when her storyline turned decidedly dark last season. Suzanne fell under the spell of Vee, who convinced her to beat up Poussey and take the rap for the attack on Red. Only a late intervention by Healy saved her from a spell in max. Better things to come in season three, hopefully.</p> \n<p><strong>Friends</strong>: Taystee, Black Cindy, Jeaney</p> \n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: None, though Poussey might find it hard to forgive her</p> \n<p><strong>Likelihood of getting beaten up in the showers? </strong>She’s more likely to do the beating.</p> \n<h2><strong>Joe Caputo </strong></h2> \n<p>Caputo is currently cock of the walk at Litchfield, having ousted the corrupt Figueroa as deputy warden. Caputo’s promising a kinder, more open penitentiary with him in charge, yet in what we’d seen of his brief tenure at the end of season two, he’d already been forced to hush up the revelation that Bennett is the father of Daya’s child. He’d do well to remember Figueroa’s parting words: “Good luck with your noble intentions, this place will beat them out of you.”</p> \n<p><strong>Friends</strong>: The members of his band, Sideboob</p> \n<p><strong>Enemies</strong>: Anyone who’s had the misfortune of witnessing his band Sideboob live</p> \n<p><strong>Likelihood of getting beaten up in the showers?</strong> Highly unlikely, bar an unforeseen prison riot</p> \n<h2><strong>Sophia Burset</strong></h2> \n<p>Arguably the best trans character on TV, Sophia rises above all of Litchfield’s petty infighting, preferring to dispense life lessons and affordable haircuts at her salon. Instead, the source of her drama comes from her relationship with her son Michael, who is beginning to accept her after years of resistance.

But just how accurate are these tests?<br /></p>","byline":"Molly Crockett and Essi Viding","body":"<p>People are fascinated by the nature of the psychopathic personality. Lurid tales of con men and serial killers capture our imagination and feature prominently in films like No Country For Old Men and Silence of the Lambs. Recent popular books on the topic like <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Psychopath_Test\">The Psychopath Test</a> and <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-psychopaths-teach-us-about-how-to-succeed/\">The Wisdom of Psychopaths</a> have brought psychopathy into the public consciousness, claiming to unmask the psychopaths among us or show how psychopathic traits can be advantageous.</p> \n<p>Psychopathy is a rare and serious personality disorder, which is primarily diagnosed in criminal justice settings. Individuals with psychopathy lack empathy and remorse, do not emotionally connect with other people, are manipulative, use other people to their own ends and are often aggressive or violent. Psychopaths are estimated to make up approximately 1% of the population, but comprise up to 20% of the prison <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Psychopath-Emotion-James-Blair/dp/0631233369\">population</a>.</p> \n<p>So could you or someone you know be a psychopath? Lately there has been a proliferation of online tests that claim to settle this question <a href=\"http://www.salon.com/2013/12/24/are_you_a_psychopath_partner/\">once and for all</a>. Some of these appear to be endorsed by people with academic credentials and in many instances it is unclear whether these people have actually led any empirical research on psychopathy. Although some people probably take these quizzes just for laughs, others may well be seeking genuine feedback about their personality. However, it is unlikely that any of these tests are able to reliably identify psychopaths. To get a diagnosis of psychopathy, an individual has to score a minimum of 30/40 on a standard diagnostic <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy_Checklist\">instrument</a> that relies on recorded, independently verified information from institutional files, as well as an in-depth interview administered by a trained professional. General members of the public would typically struggle to score more than 4/40 on this instrument and would lack the institutional file information necessary to complete the diagnostic protocol.</p> \n<p> Nevertheless, the characteristics of psychopathy fall along a continuum. People may endorse that they have some psychopathic traits without actually having a full-blown psychopathic personality disorder. But scoring relatively high on some of the features of psychopathy does not make a person a psychopath. Consequently, there is a concern that psychopathy quizzes may suggest to people with psychopathic traits that they in fact are bona fide psychopaths. To explore this possibility, we used our knowledge of psychopathic traits to see what these quizzes would make of people with such traits. The results were worrying. Some of these quizzes included a disclaimer at the start noting that “these are not diagnostic tests”, but the feedback we received suggested otherwise. OK Cupid’s <a href=\"http://www.okcupid.com/tests/the-are-you-an-psychopath-test\">quiz</a>, for example, informed us:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p> Wow, you are a genuine psychopath. You lack empathy, are highly manipulative, disregard the law, and don’t even have any delusions to blame for your behaviour. Therapy is unlikely to help you and would in fact just make you better at manipulating others. Chances are that most people don’t even realize just how sick you are.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>This <a href=\"http://www.quotev.com/quiz/961137/The-Psychopath-Test/\">quiz</a> claims to be a “real test used to diagnose criminally insane psychopaths”. Our diagnosis:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p> Well... Looks like you’re a Psychopath! But hey, that’s not always a bad thing. You guys get a bad image, people always think you kill people. That’s totally not true! With your manipulative attitude you could be anything you want, why limit yourself to murdering people? <br /></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>As scientists working in this field, this type of feedback is deeply worrying to us. We are concerned about trivializing a serious personality disorder and its appropriate measurement, which is not helpful to those who have the disorder or to their unfortunate <a href=\"http://www.aftermath-surviving-psychopathy.org/\">victims</a>. </p> \n<p>The second issue is that self-rating instruments are never perfect and there is a great deal of room for error – particularly when the instruments have not been subjected to rigorous empirical study assessing their reliability, validity and ability to capture individual differences in the population. We see no evidence that the online quizzes have undergone these procedures and as such what constitutes a high score is likely to just represent someone’s subjective opinion. It is also unclear how reliable people’s self-assessments of some features of psychopathy are, which is precisely why in criminal justice settings the diagnosis relies on file information and comparing interview findings with the file information. A person may feel less empathy and be more manipulative than the average Joe, but this is not necessarily abnormal - it is more than likely just normal variation in personality.</p> \n<p> In light of this, it is worrying that no support or adequate debriefing is provided for individuals who take these quizzes. Instead many of the sites were very happy to declare someone a psychopath and leave it at that. Such feedback is undoubtedly distressing for some people. In particular, those who encounter these quizzes on dating websites might be especially concerned about how such feedback reflects on their social abilities. At worst, the feedback was irresponsibly congratulatory and even appeared to exhort people to capitalize on their “psychopathic personality” to use others for personal gain. We were also concerned about some of the feedback “diagnosing” the respondent as a psychopath and telling them that they cannot change and that no therapy will work for them. Such feedback is misinformed. There is evidence that therapy can help psychopaths, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/srep/2015/150324/srep09426/full/srep09426.html\">particularly</a> <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bsl.928/abstract;jsessionid=D9B4F188490177B14E48F81AFB83CABF.f03t01\">in</a> <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/?&amp;fa=main.doiLanding&amp;doi=10.1007/s10979-010-9239-z\">youth</a>. </p> \n<p>Finally, misdiagnosing someone with some psychopathic traits as a full-blown psychopath could license antisocial behavior by suggesting to that person they are not responsible for their behavior. For example, <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/19/1/49.short\">studies</a> have shown that people are more likely to cheat after reading an article suggesting that free will is an illusion.</p> \n<p> In sum, the use of online quizzes to “diagnose” psychopathy is dodgy science at best and ethically irresponsible at worst. These quizzes are not valid tools for measuring a serious personality disorder that causes a great deal of suffering for many people. Properly diagnosing psychopathy requires assessment by trained professionals and convergent evidence from a variety of information sources.

The temple is surrounded by gardens – the Garden of Boulders, the Garden of Tokiwa, the Crane and Turtle Garden, and many shrines too. It is lovely just to walk around and soak in the ambience and stillness of it all. You can stay overnight at the temple guest house, called the Cave of Enlightened Dragon – the names are amazing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a27c8d0d1e895f2941fa1d24d7b960f4861b9527\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433934944205/707ac1f6-c7d1-4442-8149-6917ebb5c861-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"KYOTO, JAPAN - 2008/11/20: Shunkoin Garden - Shunkoin, a subtemple of Myoshinji Temple, was established by Yoshiharu Horio in 1590 to honor his son who died in the Battle of Odawara.
