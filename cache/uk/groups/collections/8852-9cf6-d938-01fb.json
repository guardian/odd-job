But do you think you should cut down? That more than a couple of cups isn’t good for you? Isn’t coffee linked to pancreatic and kidney cancer, and doesn’t it make your blood pressure go through the roof? Prepare to be amazed. Somehow coffee has made it on to the healthy list. The<a href=\"http://www.health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2015-scientific-report/PDFs/Scientific-Report-of-the-2015-Dietary-Guidelines-Advisory-Committee.pdf\" title=\"\"> latest US Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee</a> says there is strong evidence that drinking three to five cups a day (or up to 400mg/d caffeine) does no harm at all and that research consistently shows that coffee reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=192731\" title=\"\">There’s also evidence</a> that coffee protects you from Parkinson’s disease. High-caffeine drinks, however, are not the same as coffee and should be avoided by adolescents and drunk sparingly by adults. These drinks have sufficient amounts of caffeine to cause insomnia, jitteriness and palpitations. But coffee doesn’t seem, in reasonable amounts, to do any harm at all. So can we all stop worrying and order another cup?</p> \n<p><strong>The solution</strong></p> \n<p>It’s really black or ordinary white coffee that is linked to health benefits, not, alas, the creamy, sugary versions from coffee shops. <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2407/11/96\" title=\"\">A meta-analysis, including the results of 59 studies</a>, suggests that coffee may actually reduce the risk of many cancers including pancreatic, liver, breast and prostate cancer. This study didn’t include randomised controlled trials, so it’s impossible to definitely say that coffee was the reason for the reducations in cancer. But the evidence is, nevertheless, stronger than from any individual trials showing a link between coffee and a rise in pancreatic cancer. There are over 1,000 chemicals in coffee, some of which have credible anti-cancer effects – caffeic acid can inhibit cell pathways involved in tumour growth, and cafestol stimulates antioxidants in the cells to defend themselves against cancer development. Another meta-analysis found that four cups or more a day did not increase the risk of stroke but may, in fact, reduce it – although the authors say the studies they included were not of high quality.</p> \n<p>However, not everyone should have five or more cups of coffee a day – pregnant women are advised to stick to two. And no one is yet suggesting that we should drink more coffee to protect us from cancer or Parkinson’s disease. Coffee is a complex collection of chemicals and the health benefits are still unclear. A&nbsp;<a href=\"http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/early/2013/11/07/CIRCULATIONAHA.113.005925\" title=\"\">study found a reduction in heart disease</a> with three to five cups a day, but no such impact from the decaffeinated variety. But it is, at least, now reasonable to stop feeling guilty for drinking as much coffee as&nbsp;we want to.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431699659277/Coffee-cups-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There is evidence that coffee reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.","credit":"/PR","altText":"Coffee cups","cleanCaption":"There is evidence that coffee reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T06:00:16Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T06:00:16Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":81,"contributors":[{"name":"Luisa Dillner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/luisadillner"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Health & wellbeing","Life and style","Coffee"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/health-and-wellbeing","webTitle":"Health & wellbeing"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/coffee","webTitle":"Coffee"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Luisa Dillner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/luisadillner"}}],"series":{"title":"Dr ­Dillner’s health dilemmas","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/dr-dillner-health-dilemmas"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/18/should-i-drink-more-coffee","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49vmp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/18/should-i-drink-more-coffee","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/18/should-i-drink-more-coffee"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431699659277/Coffee-cups-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There is evidence that coffee reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.","credit":"/PR","altText":"Coffee cups","cleanCaption":"There is evidence that coffee reduces the risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease."}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Dr ­Dillner’s health dilemmas"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Sexual healing / My wife is boring in bed","rawTitle":"My wife is boring in bed","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/may/18/my-wife-is-boring-in-bed-dont-find-her-sexually-attractive","title":"My wife is boring in bed","trailText":"Pamela Stephenson Connolly","standFirst":"I avoid sex with her because, although she is the most beautiful woman I’ve ever met, I don’t find her sexually attractive","byline":"Pamela Stephenson Connolly","body":"<p><strong>I got married two months ago to my girlfriend of one and a half years.

Straddling the indie and experimental scenes like a cardigan-clad colossus, O’Rourke has played guitar with Sonic Youth, collaborated with avant garde titans Derek Bailey and Merzbow, produced a Grammy award-winning Wilco album, improvised a film score for Werner Herzog, had his own short films shown at the Whitney Biennial and, as music consultant for School Of Rock, taught a bunch of child actors how to shred like AC/DC.</p> \n<p>Since leaving Chicago post-rockers Gastr Del Sol in 1998, he’s explored American primitivist guitar (Bad Timing), glitchy electronica (I’m Happy And I’m Singing And A 1,2,3,4) and playfully zonked improv (as one-third of Fenn O’Berg), each new project seemingly intended to confound fans of the previous one. He even found time to join Sonic Youth for four years, while resisting an easy payday by turning down the opportunity to produce A-ha and the Rolling Stones.</p> \n<p>However, it’s the pair of singer-songwriter albums that O’Rourke made either side of the millennium for which he is most admired. Eureka and Insignificance, both named after Nicolas Roeg films, proved that this avowed experimentalist could also craft sumptuous pop songs in the classic tradition of Burt Bacharach and Harry Nilsson, which he served up with a side-order of wry misanthropy. Morrissey would be proud of Memory Lame’s litany of acerbic put-downs (“Listening to you reminds me of a motor’s endless drone/ And how the deaf are so damn lucky”) while the deceptively breezy Get A Room is written from the point of view of a dying man too weak to rouse his sleeping lover for a final goodbye.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyEbxVZNXK4\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tyEbxVZNXK4?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>O’Rourke’s new one belatedly picks up where Insignificance left off. Simple Songs is even comelier than its predecessors, invoking the arch, burnished AOR of Steely Dan and the rakish twinkle of Leonard Cohen. “This hand of mine has a mind of its own,” begins one song, pervily. “Never seen a curve like that,” he remarks elsewhere, while ostensibly complimenting a woman on the architectural majesty of her new roof.</p> \n<p>Living in Tokyo for the past 10 years, away from the American underground scene that he grew to resent, O’Rourke’s cynical worldview seems to have mellowed, although there’s still room, on the track Half Life Crisis, for a dig at over-the-hill hipsters who refuse to admit the jig is up (“You can tell from your face/ That you’re a charity case”). Having made his point with typical elegance and economy, you suspect that O’Rourke will be content to retreat once again to his experimental scores and improv jams.

What did you put it down to? As always, come and share your weekend’s triumphs and minor tragedies below the line</p>","byline":"Adharanand Finn","body":"<p>I once beat the marathon world record holder Dennis Kimetto in a race. Only because he dropped out, admittedly, while I plodded on to the finish, but my “win” illustrates one thing at least: even the very best runners have bad days. </p> \n<p>On Sunday, I had a bad day. </p> \n<p>Three weeks after a big PB in the London marathon, I rather casually sidled down to Cornwall for the <a href=\"http://www.imerystrailmarathon.co.uk/Default.aspx\">Imerys trail half marathon</a>. Run through a China clay quarry, it’s an epic, bizarre and hilly course. I was going great guns, racing hard and closing down on third place, when shortly after eight miles something somewhere in my body went pop. It was quite surreal. One second I was skipping through the mud and bursting up the hills, the next I felt light-headed, my arms and neck tensed up terribly, and my legs started to wobble. What happened next was not pretty.</p> \n<p>Each mile got harder and harder until even walking was a struggle. I slipped from 4th place down to 42nd place. Those watching didn’t even encourage me to start running again. One glance at my face was enough to tell them it wasn’t going to happen.</p> \n<p>I’m not sure what caused my sudden blow up. Was it too soon after London? Yet the running blog’s editor, Kate Carter, was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/may/04/how-was-your-weekend-running\">out winning races just a week after London</a>. Has anyone else similarly blown up in a race, and worked out why? </p> \n<p>My big concern is that I’m running the Lewa marathon in just over a month. It’s also hilly and run on sandy trails. The difference with Lewa, however, is that it is in Kenya, where it’s much hotter, at an altitude of 5,500ft, and there are lions, cheetah and buffalo out on the course.</p> \n<p>Those of you who read my book <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/running-with-the-kenyans.html\">Running with the Kenyans</a> will know I’ve run Lewa before. But that was after six months of training in Kenya’s Home of Champions, Iten, and even then it was a titanic struggle just to get around.</p> \n<p>This time I’m returning to spend two weeks before the race in Iten. (And by the way, if you want to <a href=\"http://www.traininkenya.com/Iten_kenya/Running_with_the_Kenyans.html\">join me on the trip, we still have a few spaces</a>.) I can only hope it’s enough to set me back on track.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t all doom and gloom in Cornwall on Sunday. The race was a great one to bring the rest of the family along to, with endless sideshow activities for spectators and kids, from rugby training and table tennis, to sushi rolling lessons(!?). The post-race fruit table was pure heaven, as was the free massage. And while I was out blowing up on the white trails of the quarry, my youngest son, who is six, was winning his first ever medal in the fun run. He went to bed with a big grin on his face. “I got a medal,” he said, closing his satisfied eyes and dropping off to sleep in record time.</p> \n<p>What did you get up to over the weekend? Did you streak to victory, or stumble to a stop? Or perhaps something in between? As ever, let us know in the comments below.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431934364801/68d92605-d2cd-4e0f-b864-302bd65f24b1-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"TOM JENKINS/TOM JENKINS","altText":"A collapsed and rather tired looking runner at a Tough Guy race","cleanCredit":"Photograph: TOM JENKINS/TOM JENKINS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T07:33:20Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T07:57:46Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":22,"contributors":[{"name":"Adharanand Finn","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/adharanandfinn"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Running","Life and style","Fitness"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/running","webTitle":"Running"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fitness","webTitle":"Fitness"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Adharanand Finn","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/adharanandfinn"}}],"series":{"title":"Weekend debrief","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/weekend-debrief"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/may/18/how-was-your-weekend-running","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49xqd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/may/18/how-was-your-weekend-running","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/may/18/how-was-your-weekend-running"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431934364801/68d92605-d2cd-4e0f-b864-302bd65f24b1-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Not so tough now, guy.

Moments later, she’s singing about being homesick with such heart-wrenching passion that you’d never notice any apparent contradiction.</p> \n<p>It’s been an emotional journey for the former postal worker since 2012, when her band started amassing celebrity fans – from Robert Plant to Barack Obama – and sold a million copies of their debut, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2012/apr/05/alabama-shakes-boys-and-girls-review\" title=\"\">Boys and Girls</a>, in the US. With Howard’s big lungs channelling Otis Redding and especially Janis Joplin, that album cast them as shamelessly but eerily good garage soulsters, everything about them so painstakingly late 1960s that you half expect them to namecheck Richard Nixon.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/mar/29/alabama-shakes-interview-sound-color-festivals\">Alabama Shakes: from small-town bar band to titans of rock</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>New album <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/apr/16/alabama-shakes-sound-and-color-review\" title=\"\">Sound and Color</a> finds them shifting into a funkier, postmodern retro soul sound, the nine-piece band (including three “background singers”) occasionally reminiscent of the Black Keys with a sprinkle of <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/67133495\" title=\"\">David Bowie’s “plastic soul” period</a>. The Shakes may be studied, but they don’t lack heart.</p> \n<p>Indeed, in this era of highly styled pop stars, there’s something inspirational about the sight of a bespectacled, short-haired, mixed-race American woman belting it out from deep within.</p> \n<p>In Future People, Howard adopts an eerie falsetto to sing about meeting spirit guides, a song perhaps inspired by her sister’s death in childhood. The likes of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTWYiXIog2Q\" title=\"\">Joe</a>, Over My Head and Be Mine are outstanding, licks-laden, emotion-soaked soul showstoppers.</p> \n<p>Howard is also an adorable character. Fans affectionately mimic her trademark whoops and hollers. When she introduces a song about a man who couldn’t keep out of jail, someone yells and she shrieks, “It’s you!” When the would-be jailbird tells her his name is Eric, she dedicates the song to Eric. “How was that?” she asks him at the end. “Whooo.

I’m confident that the discussion will throw up many different answers, some of them fiercely contested, but all reflecting the fact that just as the UK in 2015 is a very different place from what it was 10 years ago, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/theatreblog/2015/mar/09/nations-theatre-reinvented-bac\">so is its theatre</a>.</p> \n<p>The former National Theatre of Scotland artistic director <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2012/may/11/vicky-featherstone-royal-court-edge\">Vicky Featherstone</a> once said that she thought the role of a national theatre was “not to define identity, but undefine it”, and that is perhaps one of the roles of all theatre at a time when devolution and independence, our relationship to each other and our role in Europe and the rest of the world are hot topics for all of us in the UK.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2015/may/12/guardian-bac-debate-nationhood-home-manchester-homewarming\">Guardian and BAC present debate about nationhood at Home in Manchester</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s particularly significant that the debate is taking place in Manchester, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2015/may/14/eggs-collective-manchester-a-nations-theatre-group-home-truths\">a city of increasing theatrical vibrancy</a>, which has often defined itself through its culture. It’s a place where the council has understood the role that the arts can play in people’s lives and as a tool for regeneration – hence the opening of <a href=\"http://homemcr.org/\">Home</a>, the largest arts centre outside London. It is also a devolution guinea pig, with new cash, new powers and an elected mayor coming its way as part of George Osborne’s “northern powerhouse” plans. These include a new &pound;78m arts hub, The Factory, which will be home to the Manchester International festival.</p> \n<p>Flagship organisations such as the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company have sometimes been slow to reflect the diversity of the UK, a changing national sense of self, and a swiftly evolving theatre culture. But the National Theatre of Scotland (NTS) and National Theatre Wales (NTW), the latter working alongside the already established Welsh-language Theatr Genedlaethol Cymru, have been more ready to highlight and celebrate that diversity. Difference doesn’t have to be a difficulty, it can be a positive thing. Theatre produced by those organisations has been an important part of the debate around issues of national identity, but it has also looked at how those living in one place relate to those living elsewhere.</p> \n<p>George Osborne may think the Factory will help him and the Tories to be better “perceived to take the north seriously” as <a href=\"http://theconversation.com/is-the-northern-cultural-powerhouse-an-empty-bribe-37558\">Ben Walmsley has suggested</a>, but in the end it is artists not buildings who make theatre and deliver it into the heart of communities. One of the most fascinating things about NTS and NTW is the way that both have made their homelessness a bonus not a drawback, and have used to it to question how and where a national theatre might operate, and what is this thing we call home.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/theatreblog/2015/mar/09/nations-theatre-reinvented-bac\">How the nation's theatre reinvented itself | Lyn Gardner</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The NTS’s first offering in 2006 was actually called Home, and it took place simultaneously across Scotland in non-traditional venues, from ferries to disused shops. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/jan/18/social-network-arts-wales-theatre\">NTW has similarly created online networks</a> and gone into communities across Wales to make theatre with the people, helping to support local artists, and making work that <a href=\"http://nationaltheatrewales.org/gathering-yr-helfa\">reflects the landscapes</a>, mindsets and outlooks of those communities. Perhaps it’s no surprise that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2015/may/13/national-theatre-wales-director-manchester-festival-mcgrath\">NTW’s John McGrath</a>, an artistic director with an international outlook, has recently been chosen to succeed founding <a href=\"http://www.mif.co.uk/\">Manchester International festival</a> director Alex Poots, whose<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2014/nov/25/alex-poots-leaves-manchester-international-festival-new-york-culture-shed\"> final festival will be delivered this summer</a>. As always, it promises to cross art forms, boundaries and continents.</p> \n<p>It is perhaps this internationalism that has become central to the idea of a nation’s theatre, the significant changes that have taken place over the last decade or more, and the urge to look outwards not inwards for inspiration and opportunities. As companies such as <a href=\"http://www.live.org.uk/\">Live Theatre</a> in Newcastle or <a href=\"http://www.kneehigh.co.uk/\">Kneehigh in Cornwall</a> have proved, local stories travel across county boundaries and national borders with ease. Theatre-makers in Scotland and Wales, too, are now far less likely to look to London for affirmation and opportunities and far more likely to look to Europe and beyond.
