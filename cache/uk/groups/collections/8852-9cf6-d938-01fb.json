But until now so-called “virgin births” were assumed to be incredibly rare and had never been observed in vertebrates in the wild.</p> \n<p> Gregg Poulakis of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, who led the fieldwork in the study, said: “There was a general feeling that vertebrate parthenogenesis was a curiosity that didn’t usually lead to viable offspring.”</p> \n<p>In the latest study, DNA fingerprinting showed that about 3% of a sawfish population in Florida appeared to have been created through female-only reproduction, suggesting that parthenogenesis may play an important role in the survival of certain critically endangered species.</p> \n<p>Although reproducing in this way depletes the genetic diversity of a population, it could help maintain numbers during critical periods, perhaps serving as a “bridging” strategy to get through a population bottleneck.</p> \n<p>The smalltooth sawfish is a member of the ray family, distinguished by its studded saw-shaped nose-extension, which it uses to attack smaller fish. The fish, which grow to several metres in length, are found in southern Florida and have been driven close to extinction due to overfishing and habitat loss. The global population is thought to be around 1% of its level in 1900.</p> \n<p>“We were conducting routine DNA fingerprinting of the sawfish found in this area in order to see if relatives were often reproducing with relatives due to their small population size,” said Andrew Fields, who led the study at Stony Brook University in New York. “What the DNA fingerprints told us was altogether more surprising: female sawfish are sometimes reproducing without even mating.”</p> \n<p>During normal reproduction, the female egg cell matures and ejects half its chromosomes through a series of cell divisions, leaving a single set of chromosomes to combine with the single set that the sperm brings along. The resultant offspring end up with two sets of chromosomes in each of their cells, with half the genetic material coming from each parent. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5a5913e627b35902a1ff58c4913c30710e59612\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433181418892/979b70cf-da89-4c0b-a509-1c8731ada76c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sawfish\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sawfish are close to extinction due to overfishing and habitat loss.

This means that while the resultant offspring will still have two sets chromosomes in each cell, the genes on each will be exactly the same.</p> \n<p>In the study, published in <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.04.018\">Current Biology</a>, the researchers captured 190 sawfish and in each case analysed 16 sites on the genome that were known to contain short sequences that are repeated multiple times in succession. </p> \n<p>The same technique, known as Short Tandem Repeats, is used in human paternity testing: since half your genetic material comes from your father, the number of repeats on half of your chromosomes should match up with the number of repeats seen on his.</p> \n<p>When applied to the sawfish, the paternity-style test revealed that some of the fish lacked a biological father altogether.</p> \n<p>In these cases, the number of repeats on each chromosome was identical at each of the 16 sites, which could only be explained if they had inherited the entirety of their genetic material from their mother.</p> \n<p>The survey identified two fish with different mothers, which both appeared to have been born through parthenogenesis, and a further five fish, which all shared the same mother.</p> \n<p>Until now, scientists assumed that having two mirror image sets of genes would normally lead to serious health problems or be fatal, since it leaves individuals without any backup in the case of genetic flaws. Surprisingly, though, the seven parthenogens appeared to be in perfect health.<br /></p> \n<p>Dr Warren Booth, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Tulsa, who previously discovered an instance of parthenogenesis in snakes, said: “This is basically a very extreme form of inbreeding. Most people think of inbreeding as bad, but it could be helpful in purging deleterious mutations from a population.”</p> \n<p>However, he added that it would also lead to populations losing genetic diversity, which is essential for a species to remain resilient to new threats.</p> \n<p>All of the “virgin birth” fish were female, and the scientists believe that only female fish could be produced through this method since sawfish sex is determined through an XX/XY chromosome system similar to that of humans. Despite this, the population appeared to have a roughly 50:50 balance of male and female fish.</p> \n<p>The researchers have not yet established whether the offspring were fertile themselves, but are tracking the population to investigate further. “It takes a very long time for sawfish to reach sexual maturity, so it could be up to ten years until we find out,” said Fields.</p> \n<p>The authors are now trawling through publicly available genetic databases of other species to investigate whether parthenogenesis may be happening more widely.</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433181348880/e00e473a-8b41-4246-a663-43a03e0a1a6f-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC).","altText":"Sawfish","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC)."}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433181419592/4542e9e1-dc5f-4374-b2c9-443cb3bb0292-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sawfish are close to extinction due to overfishing and habitat loss.

Fars reprinted the story verbatim, including the line “60 per cent of rural whites said they at least respected that Ahmadinejad doesn’t try to hide the fact that he’s Muslim.”</p> \n<p>In 2009, two Bangladeshi newspapers were obliged to print apologies after publishing reports – based on an <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/article/conspiracy-theorist-convinces-neil-armstrong-moon--2796\">Onion story</a> – that astronaut Neil Armstrong had become convinced his moon landing was faked. It’s not just non-English language news outlets that get sucked in: four years ago, the New York Times had to issue a correction when an article about the teen fan magazine Tiger Beat <a href=\"http://www.theonion.com/article/barack-obama-tiger-beat-cover-clinches-slumber-par-5736\">reproduced a spoof cover – created by the Onion</a> – featuring President Obama (“Barack: ‘I Sing in The Shower’”).</p> \n<p>The Onion has been around, in print and then online, since 1988.

Graduate Fog, the careers website that highlights the exploitation of young people, referred to it as a <a href=\"http://graduatefog.co.uk/2015/4066/bbc-defends-hunger-games-tv-show-serious-social-experiment-britains-hardest-grafter/\">“Hunger Games-style TV show”</a>.</p> \n<p>Jack Monroe, the Guardian columnist, has <a href=\"http://agirlcalledjack.com/2015/05/28/thinking-of-applying-for-britains-hardest-grafter-read-this-first/\">warned potential contestants of the perils</a> of exposing themselves to the publicity that will inevitably occur. </p> \n<p>Labour MP Louise Haigh has written about <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/louise-haigh-mp/britains-hardest-grafter_b_7469704.html\">her unease at the “demonisation of working class people”</a>, adding: “There’s a nastiness about programmes that seek to divide people into the deserving and undeserving poor”.<br /></p> \n<p>And James Pauley, who has launched <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/the-bbc-stop-the-bbc-s-hunger-games-style-show\"> the Change.org petition</a>, described the show as “the next rung down the ladder in the disturbing trend of voyeuristic ‘poverty porn’ made popular in programmes like Benefits Street”.</p> \n<p>The BBC and Twenty Twenty, the show’s production company, reject all such criticism. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-32956969\">In a joint statement, they said</a>: “It is a misinterpretation of the concept of the series to suggest it is exploitative... the welfare of those taking part is of paramount importance”.<br /></p> \n<p>A Twenty Twenty spokesman said: “The competition structure is being used as a way of shining a light on the variety of jobs people do in the low wage economy, what it takes to do them well, and to challenge and shatter all sorts of myths surrounding the low paid and unemployed sector.<br /></p> \n<p>“When people see the final product we’re confident they’ll feel the subject was dealt with sensitively”.</p> \n<p>Twenty Twenty, which has posted advertisements calling for people to take part, is still at the casting stage.</p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433230999876/567a16f0-22b4-417f-a03d-119b154249ee-bestSizeAvailable.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":252,"width":420,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"BBC","altText":"grafter","cleanCredit":"Photograph: BBC"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-02T07:44:52Z","lastModified":"2015-06-02T08:15:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":4,"contributors":[{"name":"Roy Greenslade","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733747830/RoyGreenslade.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/roygreenslade"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Media","BBC","BBC2","Poverty","Television","Television industry","Game shows","Reality TV","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"media/media","webTitle":"Media"},{"id":"media/bbc","webTitle":"BBC"},{"id":"media/bbc2","webTitle":"BBC2"},{"id":"society/poverty","webTitle":"Poverty"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"media/television","webTitle":"Television industry"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/game-shows","webTitle":"Game shows"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/reality-tv","webTitle":"Reality TV"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Roy Greenslade","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/roygreenslade"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/greenslade/2015/jun/02/opposition-mounts-to-bbc2s-hardest-grafter-reality-show","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49dat","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/greenslade/2015/jun/02/opposition-mounts-to-bbc2s-hardest-grafter-reality-show","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2015/jun/02/opposition-mounts-to-bbc2s-hardest-grafter-reality-show"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433230999876/567a16f0-22b4-417f-a03d-119b154249ee-bestSizeAvailable.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":252,"width":420,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The advertisement asking for young people to take part in Britain’s Hardest Grafter.

But why do men rarely feel confident enough to write about women?","standFirst":"<p>Books with female subjects are less likely to win literary prizes. But why do men rarely feel confident enough to write about women?</p>","byline":"Natalie Haynes","body":"<p>Like anyone else who reads a lot of books, I’m not a bit surprised by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/01/books-about-women-less-likely-to-win-prizes-study-finds\">the news that book prizes favour narratives with male characters at their centre</a>. In fact, literary prizes tend to favour books by men about men, as novelist <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/novelist-finds-that-books-about-women-dont-win-major-aw-1708035136\">Nicola Griffith’s research</a> reveals: <a href=\"http://www.themanbookerprize.com/timeline\">the Man Booker</a>, for example, has awarded nine of its past 15 awards to men writing primarily about men, the <a href=\"http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Fiction\">Pulitzer</a> has awarded eight. The first five years of this century skewed the figures for the Man Booker: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2001/jan/06/fiction.bookerprize2001\">True History of the Kelly Gang</a>,<a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/life-of-pi\"> Life of Pi</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2003/jan/18/featuresreviews.guardianreview18\">Vernon God Little</a>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2004/apr/10/fiction.alanhollinghurst\">The Line of Beauty</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2006/may/06/fiction.johnbanville\">The Sea</a>, all by men and primarily about boys or men (and a tiger).</p> \n<p>Novels focusing on women or girls are very much less well-regarded, it seems. Griffith finds only two recent Man Bookers have been awarded to such narratives, and none of the Pulitzers. She’s right to point out the obvious: stories about women are stories about half of the world. Fail to reward those stories with recognition and publicity and you’re side-lining half of human experience. Quite aside from anything else, that’s robbing us of some good future books: publishers are often more likely to publish books that they think have a chance at a prize.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2ea9af858004b6287dddd4980fde4216400732b3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433176361157/deb03737-7741-497e-a881-cd6f3ef9af3a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Booker prize-winner Hilary Mantel.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Booker prize-winner Hilary Mantel.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sarah Lee/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But perhaps a more revealing statistic is one that Griffith doesn’t comment upon, which is that of all the book awards for adults that she considers, none of them rewarded a book about women written by a man. This is probably reflective of books submitted; hardly any male authors write female narrators or even female protagonists. There are a few exceptions: <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/colmtoibin\">Colm T&oacute;ib&iacute;n</a> repeatedly ignores this rule, as does <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ian-mcewan\">Ian McEwan</a>. But it’s extremely unusual. If male authors want to win big prizes, as things stand, they should be writing about men.</p> \n<p>Women, on the other hand, feel no such constraints: women write about men all the time. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/hilary-mantel\">Hilary Mantel</a>, to pick the most obvious example, has done pretty well at the whole prizewinning thing by writing about Thomas Cromwell. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/donna-tartt\">Donna Tartt</a> has to dust that Pulitzer every week thanks to Theo, the protagonist of The Goldfinch.</p> \n<p>So perhaps the question we should be asking is not, why do books about men win more prizes? But rather, why do men and women feel confident writing about men, but men so rarely feel confident enough to write about women? Men have been the centre of stories since <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/books/homer\">Homer</a>, which sets the template: men have adventures, while women wait for them or delay them. But we don’t live in a Homeric world now. So maybe it’s time for authors to subvert expectations and focus more on female characters. And perhaps the prizes will follow.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433176068010/73f496b5-271d-40fd-9bc6-fa6d97452f8d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Kim Haughton/Guardian","altText":"Irish Author Colm Toibin.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Kim Haughton/Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/1/1433176362816/deb03737-7741-497e-a881-cd6f3ef9af3a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Booker prize-winner Hilary Mantel.
