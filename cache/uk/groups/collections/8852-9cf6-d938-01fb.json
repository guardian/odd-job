We have been dating for five months and have sex once a week, sometimes more. It&nbsp;starts off good, but then it just never seems to end and becomes dull because he hardly ever finishes. I&nbsp;have really strong feelings for him but our sex life is like the elephant in&nbsp;the&nbsp;room. </strong></p> \n<p>All that’s missing is communication, so&nbsp;initiate a frank conversation. First, put him at ease by letting him know you have strong feelings for him, and that you particularly enjoy sex at the beginning of each lovemaking session. Then ask if he’s noticed that the erotic spark between you seems to plateau for too long, and if he can help you to figure out why. A plateau phase is actually a normal aspect of the human sexual response cycle, but in your case&nbsp;it goes on for too long. Try to work together on a solution, and be brave enough to share your individual experiences. You might say: “At a certain point, I always start feeling anxious about whether or not you’re still enjoying it. Does the same thing happen to you?” Eventually you can become more specific: “Does something distract you? I’m wondering if there’s something I could do – or not do.” Choose your words carefully, and avoid being goal-oriented about orgasm. If possible, encourage each other to ask specifically for what you need, when you need it; that is the essence of good lovemaking.</p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Pamela Stephenson Connolly is a psychotherapist who specialises in treating sexual disorders.</em></p> \n<p><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> If you would like advice from Pamela Stephenson Connolly on sexual matters, send us a brief description of your concerns to </em><a href=\"mailto:private.lives@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><em>private.lives@theguardian.com</em></a><em> (please don’t send attachments).</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113807737/7aea6e6f-cc2e-4a30-a094-f1dfb6cc1988-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Getty","altText":"I have really strong feelings for him but our sex life is like the elephant in the room.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Getty"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-15T07:00:23Z","lastModified":"2015-06-15T07:00:23Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":43,"contributors":[{"name":"Pamela Stephenson Connolly","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/pamelastephensonconnolly"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Sex","Relationships","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/sex","webTitle":"Sex"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/relationships","webTitle":"Relationships"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Pamela Stephenson Connolly","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/pamelastephensonconnolly"}}],"series":{"title":"Sexual healing","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/sexualhealing"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/15/i-find-sex-with-my-boyfriend-dull","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49jdc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/15/i-find-sex-with-my-boyfriend-dull","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/15/i-find-sex-with-my-boyfriend-dull"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113807737/7aea6e6f-cc2e-4a30-a094-f1dfb6cc1988-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"I have really strong feelings for him but our sex life is like the elephant in the room (posed by models).

They interviewed 40,000 suspects, but ruled out the real killer, Peter Sutcliffe (who was questioned nine times), because he spoke with a Yorkshire brogue. Sutcliffe murdered three more women, having already killed 10, during the period between March 1978, when the Wearside Jack hoax began, and his arrest in January 1981. </p> \n<p>Humble was only caught in 2005 during a cold-case review of original files, and was jailed for eight years for perverting the course of justice. Now aged 59, the labourer was released in 2009 after serving half his sentence. It is believed he was motivated by a desire for notoriety, and possibly a hatred of police relating to an earlier, unspecified encounter.</p> \n<p>The film’s title refers to Humble’s tape, sent to police and the Daily Mirror in 1979 in which he told Oldfield: “I’m Jack. I see you are still having no luck catching me. I have the greatest respect for you, George, but Lord! You are no nearer catching me now than four years ago when I started. I reckon your boys are letting you down, George. They can’t be much good, can they?”</p> \n<p>Oldfield, who is said to have remained convinced that the I’m Jack tapes and letters bore some connection to the killer, retired in 1983 after suffering two heart attacks in four years, the first in 1979 while he was working long hours as head of the team investigating the Ripper deaths.

Its team of friendly, helpful staff speak several languages and will greet you with a smile, carry your bags up to one of the building’s 72 rooms and, of course, do the housekeeping once you have checked out. But if you are wondering why the receptionist looks a little dead behind the eyes, it’s because she isn’t human. Out of the 12 employees at the hotel, which will open to guests next month, only two are flesh and blood. The other 10 are life-like robots. </p> \n<p>It sounds like science fiction but advances in automation, robotics and artificial intelligence are revolutionising how businesses are run. And it’s not just hospitality. From manufacturing to accountancy, the rise of the robots means the days of living, breathing people <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-new-generation-of-robots-for-manufacturing-1433300884\" rel=\"nofollow\">running a production line</a> or <a href=\"http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2015-04-21/robots-will-know-how-to-cut-your-capital-gains-taxes\" rel=\"nofollow\">calculating your taxes</a> could be numbered. But can robots ever really be a substitute for warm-blooded workers? Or are there times when you need a human touch?<br /></p> \n<p>“The work robots are best at is rote work – anything that can be routinised and performed according to a manual and a set of instructions,” explains tech entrepreneur Richard Newton, author of The End of Nice: How to be human in a world run by robots. He adds that the speed of automation means many jobs will be swept away. </p> \n<p>An <a href=\"http://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/publications/view/1314\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oxford University study</a> published in 2013 claims almost half of all jobs will be at risk from computerisation in the future.<br /></p> \n<p>While automating the mundane, repetitive tasks involved in a factory production line or crunching data will inevitably help time-poor, cash-strapped small businesses make efficiency savings, Newton reassures us that scientists still have a long way to go before they create a machine that has the ability to be genuinely creative.<br /></p> \n<p>He says: “Robots will only do the work that can be explained to them. Increasingly the profoundly human attributes of creativity and personal connections can be simulated – from a <a href=\"http://singularityhub.com/2012/05/30/robotic-quintet-composes-and-plays-its-own-music/\" rel=\"nofollow\">robot quintet</a> which composes music to <a href=\"http://metro.co.uk/2014/07/10/meet-the-robots-writing-your-news-articles-the-rise-of-automated-journalism-4792284/\" rel=\"nofollow\">automated journalists</a> writing the news. But there is no personality to the work. That’s what people want when we come to creative tasks – we want that context and insight, that array of human skills, that comes from a rounded person rather than an algorithm.”<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Consumers want to know where the products have come from and who has made them.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Sophie Jewett</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Sophie Jewett, the owner of the York Cocoa House, agrees. She believes that despite the unstoppable tide of automation that has transformed the food industry, nothing can compare to the intimacy a chocolate lover feels when devouring a handmade truffle or coffee cream.<br /></p> \n<p>She started her chocolate shop, cafe and school in resistance to what she saw as a product that she has loved from childhood becoming dehumanised through the process of automation and mass production by global confectionery companies. Jewett’s plan is to return production back to the Terry’s factory in the city by opening a chocolate processing facility with a visitor centre, cafe and shop. It will be the first time the site has been used for that purpose since the company was bought by Kraft and operations moved to Europe.<br /></p> \n<p>She says automation and factory production has led to chocolates being made with cheaper ingredients and delivered so far in advance that the quality has suffered. However, she believes the tide is turning and a consumer demand for more traditionally made artisan chocolates is growing.<br /></p> \n<p>“Consumers want to know where the products have come from and who has made them. They are more discerning and interested in trying something different,” she says. “But we need to see how automation plays a role in that change.”<br /></p> \n<p>Jewett says she is not a luddite, adverse to all forms of automation, but stresses that it is important to find a balance between the quantitative and the qualitative elements of the business. If something undermines the quality of the product, that is when any form of upscaling will compromise their values. That will be the key, she says, to how the business uses automation effectively to deliver its global ambitions and vision.<br /></p> \n<p>Of course, as the hotel in Japan highlights, robotics has the potential to do more than simply perform physical tasks – it can also lend a hand in customer service. Amelia is an artificial intelligence (AI) platform created by software company IPsoft to reduce the need for human intervention in IT infrastructure management and other business processes.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>The UK tends to be very cautious and people resist change unless they have to.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Grant Collier</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>This ‘mid-level knowledge worker’ can assist desks and customer service centres. Amelia can, for example, potentially take over the function of a call centre agent. But there are limitations to what it is capable of doing, however. It cannot reason and can only perform tasks that it has been ‘taught’ by a human colleague.<br /></p> \n<p>IPsoft’s European chief executive Frank Lansink predicts AI will be “one of the most significant trends of the 21st century” and believes it could replace 9% of the global workforce, helping businesses keep up with shrinking margins and increasing demand, flexibility cost and change.<br /></p> \n<p>However, what if you could create a robot that did have all the characteristics of a human and was equally creative and emotionally layered? That’s the dream of scientists developing AI and, while it might sound preposterous, the idea is plausible enough to prompt <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2014/dec/02/stephen-hawking-intel-communication-system-astrophysicist-software-predictive-text-type\">great minds such as Stephen Hawking</a> and Bill Gates to warn that this technology could “spell the end of the human race”.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/small-business-network/2015/jun/04/rise-connected-machines-intelligence\">The rise of the connected machines</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Grant Collier, an expert from the Processing and Packaging Machinery Association, claims the possibility of a robot-led doomsday is not as ridiculous as it sounds. Technology is advancing at an incredible pace and whatever the future holds, businesses large, medium and small need to join the revolution or find themselves surplus to requirement.

Paul Feig action comedy Spy, starring Melissa McCarthy, slipped from first to second with $16m in its second week for a total of $56.9m, while Dwayne Johnson disaster flick San Andreas pulled in a third-week total of $11m for an overall haul of $119.3m in third. The top five was rounded out by low budget horror sequel Insidious: Chapter 3, in fourth, with $7.3m in its second week for a $37.3m total, and comedy Pitch Perfect 2, with a fifth-week haul of $5.9m for a total of $170.6m. </p> \n<h2><strong>US box office chart, 12-14 June</strong></h2> \n<p>1. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/10/jurassic-world-review-chris-pratt-steven-spielberg-dinosaur-movie\">Jurassic World</a>: $204.6m - NEW</p> \n<p>2. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/04/spy-review-melissa-mccarthy-hotshot-heroine\">Spy</a>: $16m, $56.9m</p> \n<p>3. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/28/san-andreas-review-dwayne-johnson\">San Andreas</a>: $11m, $119.3m</p> \n<p>4. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/04/insidious-chapter-3-review-solidly-made-effective-horror-sequel\">Insidious: Chapter 3</a>: $7.3m, $37.3m </p> \n<p>5. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/pitch-perfect-2-anna-kendrick-review\">Pitch Perfect 2</a>: $5.9m, $170.6m</p> \n<p>6. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/03/entourage-review-hbo-tv-adaptation\">Entourage</a>: $4.3m, $25.9m</p> \n<p>7. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/11/mad-max-fury-road-review-tom-hardy\">Mad Max: Fury Road</a>: $4.1m, $138.6m</p> \n<p>8. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/apr/21/avengers-age-of-ultron-review-film-joss-whedon-exhilarating\">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a>: $3.6m, $444.7m</p> \n<p>9. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/17/tomorrowland-review-george-clooney-turns-mr-incredible-as-a-man-genius-world-saver\">Tomorrowland</a>: $3.4m, $83.6m</p> \n<p>10. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2014/sep/08/love-and-mercy-review-brian-wilson-biopic\">Love &amp; Mercy</a>: $1.7m, $4.7m</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434352736252/513eff66-9070-472c-bea9-78c9d8330c9c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Universal Pictures/Amblin Entertainment/AP","altText":"Raptor-ous reception ...

That’s what made the Tango brief stand out. Here was a client saying you can write whatever you want, just make Tango famous.</p> \n<p>My creative partner, Al Young, and I were pretty anti-advertising in our mindsets back then. Cause and effect advertising, ie you come into contact with the product and somehow it changes your life for the better, was a big trend. Bored and frustrated by the genre, the nucleus of our idea really came from a reaction to this.<br /></p> \n<p>Desperate to make a name for ourselves after spending what felt like eons trying to get into a West End agency, we knew we had to do something bold, standout and memorable to make sure we didn’t find ourselves back on the dole.<br /></p> \n<p>Coca-Cola was the big name in soft-drink advertising then. Nothing was taking on the Coke ads; nothing came close. We knew you couldn’t beat Coke at its own game. Where they had huge budget for media spend and advertising campaigns, Tango had to generate its own momentum – word of mouth was our media spend.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The actual idea started out as a joke. We said how brilliant it would be if you had a drink and something shocking happened, but so quickly that nobody else saw it. We also had the idea that it was only when commentators rewound the film that you could see what had happened. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The commentators in the advert were actually from an idea we had for another ad, but we decided mash the two together (a cardinal sin in adland). We originally had American football commentators, but we were asked to make everything more British. So we got actor Hugh Dennis to do a Eddie Waring-esque commentary and contrasted that with the dry and amusing delivery of ex-footballer Ray Wilkins.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>At first, we thought the ad would have a fat orange genie who ran up and kicked the Tango drinker on the bum. Of course, the advertising authority at the time, the <a href=\"http://www.bacc.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">BACC</a>, said no way. We got the script cleared by changing the kick to a pleasant, Morecambe and Wise-style slap on the face. I think it’s safe to say the little slap got a bit out of hand. </p> \n<p>We went to the park to do a test film, which basically involved us, two grown men, mucking about, “Tangoing” each other. As we messed around we realised the “little slap” just wasn’t powerful enough, so we exaggerated it. If you watch the ad, the Orange Man’s arms go way back before he slaps the person in the face.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>We even got jazz performer Gil Scott Heron, because of his deep, charismatic voice, to do the “You know you’ve been Tango’d” end-line. He was the first person to see the ad and I was shaking with fear, but he loved it.</p> \n<p>Somehow we also convinced serious up-and-coming actor Peter Geeves to play the Orange Man. We knew as soon as he auditioned – the way he ran with his stomach sticking out – that he’d be perfect. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>I first knew the ad was huge when I fell asleep on the London Underground one evening. I woke up to hear a group of kids talking about and mimicking it. I wanted to go up and say: “I did that!”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>The ad continued to grow in notoriety. I remember having a conversation with a doctor who complained that kids were “Tangoing” each other at the cost of perforated ear drums. Naturally, it got banned and we had to write a new version, in which the orange man comes up and gives the Tango drinker a big kiss – far less likely to perforate the eardrum (skip to 1:20 in the video to see the ad).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"676902e036731ebae5dff792fb6629f0faf8ea52\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434108571450/7adf79cb-d8b7-4a46-9d88-cf0a85974933-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Orange Man from the Tango ad\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Peter Geeves played the ad’s Orange Man.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Quiet Storm</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>At the time advertising tended to be very slick, beautifully-scripted and with big budgets, so a lot of the industry didn’t like our ad. One of the big advertising professionals called it “oik advertising”. But we loved that. We were a combination of a very talented Scotsman, Al and me, helped along by some very talented creative directors. We knew we were brave enough to do stuff that nobody else would do, or think about doing. I think that’s what made the ad what it is.

From September, AQA – the largest exam board for sociology A-levels – is dropping the topic from its syllabus and removing references to it from textbooks.</p> \n<p>Until now, Emile Durkheim’s 1897 study of suicide has been a central part of A-level sociology. It’s a seminal study, significant in the history and development of sociology as a science. But concerns that some students may be distressed by the topic mean it will no longer feature in AQA’s syllabus.</p> \n<p>With just under 25,000 students entered for AQA’s A-level last year – compared with only 6,000 at other exam boards – the decision to drop Durkheim’s study will change the way sociology is taught in most schools. Teachers can still choose to cover suicide, but in reality anything excluded from the syllabus is unlikely to be taught.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>If an essay on Durkheim gives a student the chance to discuss suicide, even in a theoretical way, that can save lives</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Ged Flynn, campaigner</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Rupert Sheard, AQA qualifications manager, says the decision was reached in consultation with teachers, and reflects a balance between keeping the subject exciting and maintaining “a duty of care to all those students taking our course to make sure the content isn’t going to cause them undue distress”.</p> \n<p>But can studying Durkheim’s analysis of 19th century suicide statistics cause distress? And if so, is that a legitimate reason to remove such a significant text from an A-level course?</p> \n<p>Laura Campion has just qualified as a sociology teacher at Hayes school, a mixed comprehensive in Bromley, Kent. She took the AQA A-level herself four years ago. “Suicide is one of my favourite parts of it, to be honest,” she says. “I think it’s fascinating. In order to teach sociology as a science it’s the perfect example. I will miss teaching it.”</p> \n<p>Campion acknowledges that suicide can be a sensitive topic. But she’s confident that strong pastoral care and an emphasis on sociology as a rigorous, academic discipline lessens the risk of any distress. The school’s head of sociology, Kate Gordon, agrees. In 12 years, she has never had a problem teaching about suicide. “Students know what they’ve signed up for when they take the course,” she says. “It’s not about personal anecdote. We’re training them to debate and to argue, but sensibly and within the realms of the subject.”</p> \n<p>For Gordon’s students, sociology offers a rare opportunity to analyse difficult issues. Eloise Pasmore-O’Pray and R&eacute;R&eacute; Olutimehin are about to sit their A-levels. They’re adamant that sensitive subjects shouldn’t be avoided just because of the possibility that the topic might make someone upset. “I don’t think it’s worth stopping teaching something because of that,” says Pasmore-O’Pray. Olutimehin doesn’t think it will help students either. “When you’re hiding stuff from them in school, it’s just going to make things difficult for them.”</p> \n<p>These sentiments are echoed by Ged Flynn, chief executive of Papyrus, a charity working to prevent youth suicide. Flynn argues that concern about possible distress is not a valid reason for changing the curriculum. “Why are they removing this part of the syllabus? It’s not because Durkheim has suddenly become less important. It’s been dropped because people feel uncomfortable teaching about suicide because of the stigma and pain. But suicide won’t go away if we feel sensitive about it. Teachers need to get over themselves or get a new job.”</p> \n<p>The suicide element of the A-level course is highly theoretical, focusing on methodology and the use of statistics to understand social phenomena. For Flynn, academic analyses of suicide can be as important as what is taught in PSHE. “Culturally we need to stop just putting suicide in certain places. It should be part of all lessons. The research shows that if I am suicidal, I am desperate for you to talk about it. If an essay on Durkheim gives a student the opportunity to discuss suicide, even in a theoretical way, that can save lives.”</p> \n<p>Suicide is not the only sensitive issue in sociology, and many teachers find other topics challenging to teach. “The biggest issue is domestic violence,” says Sarah Worton, a former sociology teacher who now runs the Institute of Education’s PGCE in social science. In her experience, units on race and ethnicity, class and educational attainment can also create difficult situations in the classroom.</p> \n<p>But, as she explains, PGCE students learn how to deal with these sensitive topics through scenarios that come up throughout the course. Worton’s own approach is to establish boundaries about how issues are discussed, warn any students affected about potentially distressing subjects, and give them a choice about whether, and how, they study the topic.</p> \n<p>Campion has already had to put these strategies into practice on a placement at another school, teaching a student with direct experience of domestic violence. “The way I handled it was to approach the child beforehand and explain: this is what we’re going to do next lesson. I would like you to be in that lesson because it is part of this course, and we do have to do it. But if you feel uncomfortable and you do want to leave, feel free. I told her we could do it at a different time alone.”</p> \n<p>On this occasion, the student ended up sharing her experience with the rest of the class. “The other students listened, they were respectful, and it helped her,” says Campion.</p> \n<p>Despite Maria’s initial anxiety about teaching the suicide lesson, her student also ended up fully participating in the class, though from a purely academic perspective. Maria describes how she adapted the lesson. Rather than using her usual introduction to the topic, which involves sharing the experience of a suicide within her family, Maria stuck to a theoretical examination of Durkheim’s work. The lesson remained focused on methodology, and there was no opportunity for personal discussion.</p> \n<p>This approach worked for Maria and her student, and it has convinced her that the solution to distressing issues lies in how you teach them, rather than removing them. “If they are dropping suicide because it causes distress to students, then there’s so much content they may as well drop from sociology. For example, I dealt with a student who was a victim of a sexual assault. And I did find it really uncomfortable to teach her the feminist views on courts. How they’re seen as patriarchal, and how in rape cases it’s almost like the women are on trial.</p> \n<p>“That made me really uncomfortable because I didn’t want her to feel that she shouldn’t go to court, or that was going to happen to her. It was much worse than the suicide lesson. But I just tried my best to teach it in a neutral way.”</p> \n<p>Maria points out that she loves sociology precisely because it’s topical. “That’s what makes it interesting. And that’s real life as well,” she says. What matters most to her is how you deal with that challenge. “If you’re teaching sociology it’s your responsibility to make sure that you address topics in an appropriate manner and create a safe environment for all your students to learn in.”</p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434036463984/Kate-Gordon-left-and-Laur-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Kate Gordon, left, and Laura Campion, centre, with piupils at Hayes School in Bromley.
