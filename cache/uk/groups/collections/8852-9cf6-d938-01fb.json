We know of its existence from just a handful of specimens, the first collected by British zoologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_C._Jerdon\">Thomas Jerdon</a> in around 1844. For most of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, it was assumed extinct. Then, in January 1986, a trapper spotted a live courser near the town of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kadapa\">Kadapa</a> in Andhra Pradesh, managed to catch it and kept it alive until Bharat Bhushan, an ornithologist at the <a href=\"http://bnhs.org/bnhs/\">Bombay Natural History Society</a>, arrived to confirm its identity. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32519df7da5ee80706cd5f11442b2cca1613a26a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435159297044/657ca8f9-11a2-43d4-8e48-ca5ec90b4df4-308x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jerdon’s courser\" width=\"308\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the first artistic renditions of Jerdon’s courser, by John Gerrard Keulemans</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: The Internet Archive</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When Knox chanced upon this egg in the stores of the Zoology Museum at the University of Aberdeen in 2008, he quickly ran some background checks. As far as he could tell, there was no formal description of a Jerdon’s courser egg anywhere and not a single other specimen on record. This egg – if it was what it claimed to be – was one of a kind.</p> \n<p>But what if the person that penned the label was mistaken? What if the egg did not belong to Jerdon’s courser but to some other bird? “How do you actually identify something nobody has ever seen before?” wrote Knox in a <a href=\"http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CCUQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.researchgate.net%2Fprofile%2FAlan_Knox%2Fpublication%2F276266578_George_Rose_and_the_tale_of_the_Indian_egg%2Flinks%2F555359be08aeaaff3bf19414.pdf&amp;ei=EZ-EVaHmGYLC7gal8IHIBg&amp;usg=AFQjCNG99GKnlJkJ5eYB7ZtR3LopEntTzA&amp;sig2=Sa3qML4K9qAuwvrR2EKfDA&amp;bvm=bv.96339352,d.ZGU\">University of Aberdeen magazine</a>.</p> \n<p>The answer was DNA. There are just five preserved skins of Jerdon’s courser that survive and two of them are in the ornithological collection at the <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/tring.html\">Natural History Museum, Tring</a>. A colleague <a href=\"http://www.abdn.ac.uk/ibes/profiles/s.piertney\">Stuart Piertney</a> took scrapings from the membrane lining the inside the mystery egg and shavings from a toe-pad from one of the two courser skins. “The sequences obtained from the egg and the toe-pad were identical, indicating that they had come from the same species,” wrote Knox and Piertney in the <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alan_Knox/publication/276266836_The_discovery_of_the_egg_of_Jerdon%27s_Courser_Rhinoptilus_bitorquatus_(Blyth_1848)/links/5553589b08ae6943a86f268b.pdf\">Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society</a>.</p> \n<p>So how did an egg of so rare a species wend its way to Aberdeen? Knox worked hard to figure this out and wrote it up in <a href=\"http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/anh.2014.0211\">Archives of Natural History</a> last year. The egg appears to have been collected in around 1917 by Ernest Gilbert Meaton, a vet working at the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolar_Gold_Fields\">Kolar Gold Fields</a> to the east of Bangalore. Meaton sold his collection (including the courser egg) to George Falconer Rose (an engineer-cum-entrepreneur in Calcutta), who gifted the eggs to his alma mater <a href=\"http://www.grammar.org.uk/\">Aberdeen Grammar School</a>, which passed them on to the Zoology Museum of the University of Aberdeen in around 1978. </p> \n<p>Jerdon’s courser is “critically endangered” on the <a href=\"http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/full/22694103/0\">IUCN’s Red List of Threatened Species</a>.

Is it still hot fo’ shizzle or is it just meh? If you would struggle to decipher that opening sentence, you can now consult the Oxford English Dictionary, which has included those four phrases in more than 500 new entries announced on Thursday.</p> \n<p>Twerking seems to be an unlikely contender for first time inclusion – for a word to qualify, it must have been have been in popular use for at least 10 years in novels and newspapers. The thrusting dance was popularised by the singer Miley Cyrus at a 2013 MTV awards show and, two years on, it already seems somewhat pass&eacute;.</p> \n<p>But twerking, which the dictionary describes as dancing “in a sexually provocative manner, using thrusting movements of the bottom and hips while in a low, squatting stance”, is almost 200 years old.</p> \n<p>Researchers found it was first used as a noun in 1820, spelt “twirk”, to refer to a “twisting or jerking movement” or “twitch”. The verb is believed to have emerged later in 1848, and the “twerk” spelling was popularly used by 1901. </p> \n<p>Fiona McPherson, a senior editor of Oxford English Dictionary, said: “We are confident that it is the same origins as the dance. There has been constant use up into the present day to mean that same thing. I think it’s quite spectacular, the early origins for it. We were quite surprised.” </p> \n<p>Popular culture may often be given credit for inventing words it had merely popularised, the research found, citing “meh”, an interjection communicating a lack of enthusiasm, believed to have been first used in 1992 but popularised by the Simpsons.</p> \n<p>“Twitterati”, describing users of the social networking site, and “fo’ shizzle”, slang speak meaning “for sure”, have also been added to the dictionary this year. </p> \n<p>New trends in technology have a key influence on the inclusion of new words. Though the word “webisode” has been in use since 1996, the increasing popularity of online-only TV shows such as Netflix’s<em> </em>House of Cards and Orange is the New Black may have been a prompt for its inclusion this year.</p> \n<p>“Vape” was added to the dictionary in 2014, but only this year was the noun “e-cigarette” added. It is defined as a “cigarette-shaped device containing a nicotine-based liquid or other substance that is vaporised and inhaled, used to simulate the experience of smoking”. The word’s usage can be traced back to 2007. </p> \n<p>Several new additions have an environmental focus, such as the popular gap-year pursuit of “voluntourism”, and “ecotown”, defined as a “new town designed to have a minimal impact on the environment and to facilitate an environmentally responsible lifestyle for its residents”. </p> \n<p>Another addition is “freegan”, a noun or adjective first recorded in use in the Sunday Times in 1997, meaning a “person who eats discarded food, typically collected from the refuse of shops or restaurants, for ethical or ecological reasons”.</p> \n<p>McPherson said all the new entries were deemed to have earned their place in the history of the English language.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435163380714/08b83e7b-4724-4c40-aa28-e1d8206efd16-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for MTV","altText":"Miley Cyrus twerking on stage at the 2013 MTV Music Awards.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic for MTV"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-24T23:01:02Z","lastModified":"2015-06-24T23:45:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":83,"contributors":[{"name":"Jessica Elgot","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jessica-elgot"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Written language","Spoken word","Reference and languages","Books","UK news","Twitter","Miley Cyrus","E-cigarettes"],"tags":[{"id":"books/written-language","webTitle":"Written language"},{"id":"culture/spoken-word","webTitle":"Spoken word"},{"id":"books/referenceandlanguages","webTitle":"Reference and languages"},{"id":"books/books","webTitle":"Books"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter"},{"id":"music/miley-cyrus","webTitle":"Miley Cyrus"},{"id":"society/e-cigarettes","webTitle":"E-cigarettes"}],"section":{"id":"books"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jessica Elgot","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jessica-elgot"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"books"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/jun/25/twerking-twitterati-fo-shizzle-meh-oxford-english-dictionary-new-words","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4n2","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/books/2015/jun/25/twerking-twitterati-fo-shizzle-meh-oxford-english-dictionary-new-words","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/25/twerking-twitterati-fo-shizzle-meh-oxford-english-dictionary-new-words"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435163894888/77248565-afa0-4633-8726-e72c0fb7cc3e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Miley Cyrus twerking on stage at the 2013 MTV Music Awards.

We know that house prices are expensive around good schools, but how do we find properties that are not near good schools in order to benefit from this? <strong>BT</strong></p> \n<p><strong>A</strong> You are not wrong that properties near good schools tend to cost more. Research by Lloyds in August 2014 which looked at prices of properties in the catchment areas of England’s 30 best state schools<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2014/aug/26/good-schools-add-21000-pounds-property-prices\"> found they were an average of &pound;21,000 </a>higher than the average house price in the county in which the school is based. More recent research by estate agents Savills in March this year found that the cost of homes near the top 400 best-performing schools can be more than 25% higher than in other areas.</p> \n<p> In general, the premium on the price of a property in a good school’s catchment area has been considered to be the price you pay for getting into a good state school and so avoiding school fees. But what’s interesting about the Savills research – which looks at both state and fee-paying schools – is that being near a good fee-paying school will also push up property prices. </p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.savills.co.uk/blog/article/187279/residential-property/interactive-map-how-secondary-schools-affect-local-house-prices.aspx\">Savills’s interactive map</a> is a useful starting point for identifying where not to buy property although its data covers only the top 400 schools so it won’t give a warning signal for other schools. For example, Phil &amp; Jim state primary school in Oxford doesn’t appear in the Savills’ survey but it does push up property prices in its catchment area. </p> \n<p>Keeping away from any properties where a particular school is named in the estate agent’s particulars would help avoiding premium prices as would checking a school’s Ofsted perfomance tables which give one of four possible inspection grades: 1 is outstanding; 2 is good; 3 is satisfactory or requires improvement; and 4 is inadequate. Buying a property near a school with a grade 3 or 4 is likely to get you more for your money than one near a school with a grade 1 or 2.</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435225271412/3ba105e0-fde9-46b2-b451-cbe3be76da16-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Phanie/Alamy","altText":"mother and child on zebra crossing","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Phanie/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T09:41:50Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T09:41:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Virginia Wallis","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/virginiawallis"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["House prices","Property","Money"],"tags":[{"id":"money/houseprices","webTitle":"House prices"},{"id":"money/property","webTitle":"Property"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"}],"section":{"id":"money"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Virginia Wallis","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/virginiawallis"}}],"series":{"title":"Ask the experts: homebuying","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/money/series/expertsproperty"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"money"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/2015/jun/25/how-can-we-find-a-property-away-from-school-catchment-areas","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4nz","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/money/2015/jun/25/how-can-we-find-a-property-away-from-school-catchment-areas","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/jun/25/how-can-we-find-a-property-away-from-school-catchment-areas"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435225271412/3ba105e0-fde9-46b2-b451-cbe3be76da16-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Readers would like to avoid living near a good school.

First came 92-year-old <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/01/harriette-thompson-92-oldest-woman-complete-marathon-san-diego\">Harriette Thompson</a>, the oldest marathon finisher on record and a grandmother of ten. At a rather brisker pace, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/jessica-ennis\">Jessica Ennis</a> chested the tape to qualify for next year’s Olympics. The words “inspirational” and “supermum” haven’t been bandied about with such abandon since <a href=\"http://joannepavey.com/\">Jo Pavey</a> won gold in Glasgow and earned herself a million new Twitter followers from the Mumsnet generation in the process.<br /></p> \n<p>We mothers and grandmothers in Lycra have come a long way. Although we were banned for years from competing in strenuous distance events in case our wombs dropped out, once we showed we could channel the same strength it takes to push out a baby into athletic prowess, mums of steel started to stride into the sports pages. </p> \n<p>In 1991, <a href=\"http://www.britishathletics.org.uk/e-inspire/hall-of-fame-athletes/liz-mccolgan/\">Liz McColgan</a> attracted opprobrium and admiration in equal measure when she won the world cross-country championships three months after giving birth to her daughter (she was first woman in her debut New York City marathon later that same year). Sixteen years later, the news that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/sport/paularadcliffe\">Paula Radcliffe</a> was back out training 12 days after her first child was born might have made most raddled new mothers wince, but her tenacious attitude won approval – and an NYC marathon gong of her own.<br /></p> \n<p>Nowadays most forms of exercise, including running, are recommended in most cases throughout pregnancy and into new motherhood . Indeed, pressure and research group Tommy’s, which aims to halve the number of babies that die during pregnancy or birth by 2030, have a campaign, <a href=\"http://www.tommys.org/page.aspx?pid=363\">Upbeat</a> which recommends structured exercise for pregnant mothers. </p> \n<p>Most devoted runners in my club continued running as close to their due date as they could comfortably manage, as did, indeed, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2013/mar/20/run-while-pregnant-strangers-advice\">Amelia Hill</a>.</p> \n<p>However, it is coming back to running after the baby arrives that presents the biggest challenge for ordinary mortals. Even once you’ve managed to exchange the posset-stained dressing gown for something approaching PE kit, the issue of childcare often derails fitness ambitions. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We advise women not to start classes too soon after the birth – most show up when the baby is a couple of months old</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Professional athletes, and the wealthy, may be able to afford a nanny to mind the baby while they sweat out the post-partum blues with their personal trainers, but the rest of us have to rely on local leisure centre creches, friends or family. Sometimes arranging childcare proves too taxing, and it’s just easier to wander around aimlessly with the buggy, and kid yourself you’re wandering back to fitness. </p> \n<p>That’s why outdoor fitness classes, where the baby comes along, too, have proved such a boon for new parents in recent years. I wish they’d existed 25 years ago, when I had my first child, and seemed to spend inordinate amounts of time being hauled out of aerobics classes to settle him in the creche. </p> \n<p>Now that I’m a runner of mature years, my love of the sport has led me to train as a <a href=\"http://www.runengland.org/page.asp?section=38\"><strong>running coach,</strong></a> so that I can lead <a href=\"http://www.greenwichpilates.co.uk/buggyrunners.aspx\"><strong>buggy-runner classes</strong></a> in my local parks. It gets me out of the office, and does my heart good to see women take their first power-walking steps to postnatal fitness. It’s a baby-steps approach, literally. </p> \n<p>The women (and it is usually women that come to our classes, although fathers and male carers are welcomed) have to fill out a health questionnaire. We advise women not to start classes too soon after the birth of their baby – most show up when the baby is a couple of months old. Those mothers who have had a caesarian section are monitored carefully and given alternative exercises to the more taxing core work that forms the final section of the class. </p> \n<p>Runners don’t have to invest in a swanky, three-wheeled, all-terrain buggy for the class. Most modern prams are robust enough for our hilly local park.</p> \n<p>The hour-long sessions start with power-walking and power-talking. The workouts are as much about getting together and comparing notes as about easing back into running. From the warm up, the buggy-runners move into dynamic drills, running drills, hill running, then finish with core work and stretches. </p> \n<p>Everything is done with your baby in tow. Sometimes, the buggies are parked up for the runners to practise their hill-sprints or step-ups unencumbered, which is when this coach puts on her nanny hat. For me, this is extra-gratifying. I love babies, but it’s a while since I had mine. Indeed, I’m a little broody, having just become a grandmother whose little <em><a href=\"http://www.dict.cc/german-english/Enkel.html\">enkel</a></em> lives in Berlin. </p> \n<p>So I get to cuddle babies, pass on words of wisdom and guide new parents to their first 5K race. Some buggy-runners treat the class as a social event, repairing to the park cafe for cappuccino and cake every week; others decide to join our Saturday running group or Sunday long-running marathon group. Some end up loving running so much they join a club and win trophies (one ex-buggy-runner is now a sub three-hour marathoner). </p> \n<p>From my vantage point as Old Mother Coach and club runner, I’ve witnessed at first hand the so-called <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/aug/12/jo-pavey-gold-european-athletics-championships-zurich\">baby boost</a> effect. Many women, like Jo and Paula, go on to run even more strongly after having children. That might be because of better lung capacity after running around with about 26lb extra weight in pregnancy, or a more relaxed mental attitude – nothing, not even winning, is more important than your children – or better organisation (you become a more focused, more efficient runner if you’re on a strict deadline imposed by parenting duties). </p> \n<p>Whatever causes baby boost, it’s worth having a go at harnessing it. Who knows, a gentle jog with your baby under the encouraging eye of a veteran runner, mother and granny like me may not make an elite athlete of you, but it could at least result in podium glory in the mother’s race at some future school sports day.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435166482040/08a619d4-33a9-4425-9c9d-180b110d86bf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Chloe Johnson / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"Keep on running … Latest guidance says most women can exercise while pregnant","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Chloe Johnson / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-25T05:35:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-25T05:39:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":19,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Fitness","Running","Life and style","Pregnancy","Parents and parenting"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/fitness","webTitle":"Fitness"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/running","webTitle":"Running"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/pregnancy","webTitle":"Pregnancy"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/25/pregnant-new-mum-nows-the-time-to-get-jogging","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49h3f","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/25/pregnant-new-mum-nows-the-time-to-get-jogging","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/jun/25/pregnant-new-mum-nows-the-time-to-get-jogging"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435166482040/08a619d4-33a9-4425-9c9d-180b110d86bf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Keep on running … Latest guidance says most women can exercise while pregnant.

Then, in&nbsp;March, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jun/15/story-of-yorkshire-ripper-hoaxer-wearside-jack-to-be-made-into-movie\" title=\"\">a letter arrived&nbsp;at headquarters addressed to George Oldfield</a>, the assistant chief constable heading the inquiry. Over the&nbsp;course of the next year and three months two more letters were sent, signed “Jack the Ripper”, and, most significantly, a tape, all purporting to be from the killer. The police changed&nbsp;course and focused on Sunderland, from where the communications originated.</p> \n<p>In late June of 1979, the recording of&nbsp;“Wearside Jack” taunting the beleaguered Oldfield was broadcast over and over again, becoming seared into public imagination and memory. It&nbsp;played over the airwaves of our local radio station in Sheffield almost as nightly entertainment. From my bedroom window I would stare, transfixed, into the blackness of the garden, wondering if “he” were somewhere out there in the shadows.</p> \n<p>South Yorkshire had not been targeted by the Ripper at that point, but on 2 January 1981 <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/uk/peter-sutcliffe\" title=\"\">Peter Sutcliffe was caught in the lane behind my school</a>, initially arrested for having fake number plates on his car. The young woman he had picked up from the red-light district around the corner a few minutes earlier had the luckiest escape of her life. Yet because of the concentration on Wearside Jack, the inquiry had taken a false and disastrous turn, leaving Sutcliffe, the actual killer, who had by then been interviewed nine times by police, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2005/oct/19/ukcrime.uknews2\" title=\"\">free to murder three more women</a>.</p> \n<p>Oldfield was retired from the case due to ill health in late 1979 and died in 1985. One of his many tactical errors was the assertion that the killer craved publicity; his complicity in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2005/oct/21/ukcrime.gender\" title=\"\">the crude hoax left his reputation in tatters</a>. Even as Sutcliffe’s trial began, Oldfield still believed the letters and tape were linked to the murders. It was not until 2005 and random DNA testing that <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/uk/2006/mar/21/ukcrime.uknews21\" title=\"\">John Samuel Humble, a petty criminal in his late 40s from Castletown, Sunderland</a>, was identified as Wearside Jack, charged with perverting the course of justice, and jailed for eight years.</p> \n<p>With his first book, Mark Blacklock fits effortlessly into the lineup of accomplished literary chroniclers of the Ripper years, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2001/aug/02/artsfeatures.fiction\" title=\"\">such as David Peace</a> and the late Gordon Burn. In common with Burn, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2009/jul/20/gordon-burn-obituary\" title=\"\">whose outstanding <em>Somebody’s Husband, Somebody’s Son</em></a> provided forensic biographical details and compelling psychological insights into Sutcliffe’s crimes, Blacklock has fashioned an intelligent, disturbing slice of&nbsp;noir, which falls into no particular category – rather like his subject. He reconstructs Humble’s preferred epistolary style to develop further the “relationship” between Wearside Jack and the now deceased police officer. Blacklock’s Humble continues to address Oldfield in a mock-affectionate, softly menacing tone, complete with all the syntactical idiosyncracies of Humble’s original missives, which set graphologists off in a tailspin.</p> \n<p>The narrative is interspersed with police and psychological reports, creative writing exercises, letters to Humble in prison from cranks and obsessives, and an extended piece of pulp fiction. Born in Sunderland in 1974, just prior to the start of Sutcliffe’s spree, Blacklock has the area’s linguistic cadences and landmarks at his fingertips, as well as its cavernous history and quiet desperation. The varied range and wit of his polyphonic chorus are reminiscent of Joe Orton’s <a href=\"http://www.joeorton.org/Pages/Joe_Orton_Life9a.html\" title=\"\">darkly subversive correspondence pranks</a>. Humble, as portrayed by Blacklock, is the bored fantasist with few prospects who craves notoriety because no one listens to him&nbsp;down the pub. By turns apologetic, self-pitying and defiant, the man&nbsp;who calls himself “Jackanory” and “Jack the Giant Killer” takes on a&nbsp;new alias when he is freed on licence: the book ends with his application to change his name.</p> \n<p>Should we be interested in Humble as a piece of cultural history, the 20th-century foil to his true fascination, Jack&nbsp;the Ripper? The women who Sutcliffe butchered so frenziedly, “the&nbsp;lasses” to whom Humble expresses his&nbsp;own careless misogyny, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2007/dec/27/ukcrime.uk\" title=\"\">remain as mere ciphers</a>.
