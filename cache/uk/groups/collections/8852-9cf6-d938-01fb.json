In the process it hopes to recharge the natural world with wonder and help people to reconnect with it. Here are some of the species that have been lost to our countryside but may yet return:</p> \n<h2>Dalmatian pelican </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ff42c338125b1f6018959a826a14f8904233856\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4ff42c338125b1f6018959a826a14f8904233856/0_398_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\" Dalmatian Pelicans (Pelecanus crispus), group competing for fish discarded by fishermen, Lake Kerkini, Central Macedonia, Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> Dalmatian pelicans (<em>Pelecanus crispus</em>) competing for fish discarded by fishermen in Lake Kerkini, Central Macedonia, Greece</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marko K&ouml;nig/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Pelicans once lived throughout Europe. The most recent record in Britain is a medieval bone found near Glastonbury. It’s an enormous bird, whose wingspan is just shy of that of the wandering albatross. There is plenty of suitable habitat in Britain, though it is strongly affected by disturbance when breeding, so potential sites would have to be selected carefully.</p> \n<h2>Bluefin tuna</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5158f4ccbe0a6f7f8388ebdaafb23b47d957aabc\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5158f4ccbe0a6f7f8388ebdaafb23b47d957aabc/0_79_4256_2555/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Atlantic bluefin tuna feeds in the waters of Canada’s Gulf of Saint Lawrence.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An Atlantic bluefin tuna feeds in the waters of Canada’s Gulf of Saint Lawrence.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian J. Skerry/NG/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Until 80 years ago, shoals of giant bluefin tuna followed the herring and mackerel migrating round our coasts. For many years, the world record tuna caught on rod and line was one hooked a mile off Scarborough in 1933. Big game fishing by the grand personages who descended on the town for this sport every summer probably contributed to the tuna’s demise, as did overharvesting of the fish the tuna ate. Today they appear very rarely off our coasts, but would be likely to return if there’s a reduction in fishing pressure.</p> \n<h2>Grey whale</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8886472bf83f8e93016cc109e77283c1a9d5d08a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/8886472bf83f8e93016cc109e77283c1a9d5d08a/0_353_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"gray whale (Eschrichtius robustus, Eschrichtius gibbosus), spyhopping, Mexico, Baja California, San Ignacio Lagoon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grey whale (<em>Eschrichtius robustus, Eschrichtius gibbosus</em>) in San Ignacio Lagoon of Baja California, Mexico. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Blickwinkel/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Grey whales fed in Britain’s estuaries and shallow bays until around 400 years ago, when they were hunted to extinction. Now the only remaining populations are in the Pacific, where they are the most popular species for whale watching, as they appear to have an affinity for people. It’s not yet clear whether bringing them back to Britain is logistically possible: they would have to be airlifted across several thousand miles.</p> \n<h2>Lynx</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95007aa1ca335c949b64eb47c2bf95072e6c7139\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/95007aa1ca335c949b64eb47c2bf95072e6c7139/0_299_6781_4070/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lynx\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eurasian lynx, <em>Eurasischer luchs</em>.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christoph Bosch/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The youngest bone discovered in Britain so far is about 1,500 years old, though there are slightly later cultural records, including an apparent mention in Aneurin’s saga <em>Y Gododdin</em>, and a carving on a 9<sup>th-</sup>century stone cross on the Isle of Eigg. The lynx is a specialist roe deer predator, which is handy in a country whose deer population has boomed in recent years. There is no record or even anecdotal account of attacks on humans. Threats to livestock are limited by its reluctance to leave the woods in which it lives.</p> \n<h2>Beaver</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ee94cf97853e4bb41bd1ca58ff99d8fed395131\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9ee94cf97853e4bb41bd1ca58ff99d8fed395131/0_0_5530_3320/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Beaver\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beavers are key species in eco systems they inhabit. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Chapman/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Beavers once lived in most of our rivers, and are commemorated in various place names, such as Beverley in Yorkshire, Beverston in Gloucestershire and Barbon in Cumbria. After becoming extinct here perhaps in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, they have recently been re-established in Knapdale in western Scotland, the River Tay in Perthshire and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/24/baby-beavers-born-to-englands-first-wild-colony\">the River Otter in Devon</a>. They have many beneficial effects on rivers, reducing floods, restoring incised (vertically eroded) stream beds and providing habitats for many other species.</p> \n<h2>Boar</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"245351bff7e9a01ee61841a74014e91c5200f20c\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/245351bff7e9a01ee61841a74014e91c5200f20c/0_0_5229_3137/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wild boar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild boar (<em>Sus scrofa</em>) sow with piglets, known as a sounder group, in the Forest of Dean, Gloucestershire, UK. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Les Gibbon/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wild boar are among the most important of Britain’s ecological engineers. By grubbing in the woodland floor, they increase the diversity of the plants that can grow there. They dig up bracken rhizomes, allowing tree seedlings to rise through what would otherwise be an impenetrable mat. Their wallows are a useful habitat for water-loving plants, insects and amphibians. Wild boar have escaped from farms and are at large in several parts of the countryside, but they are threatened by the government’s policy of allowing landowners to decide whether or not they should be allowed to survive.</p> \n<h2>Wolf</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3a20b526649ff46c02cc06d839efc419d2e36459\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436886264992/3f46d473-a2e0-422b-a3fa-4d7e9b560117-460x297.jpeg\" alt=\"Wolves\" width=\"460\" height=\"297\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">European grey wolf (<em>Canis lupus canids) </em>playing in the snow. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernhardt Reiner/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There’s some controversy about when the wolf became extinct in Britain, but the last certain record is an animal killed in Sutherland in 1621. Wolves are the most controversial species proposed for reintroduction here, and nothing is likely to happen for some decades. Their reputation for ferocity is undeserved: they go to great lengths to avoid people. But they do take livestock, which would need to be protected by dogs or other measures. Wolves are critical to the restoration of ecosystems, especially of places – like the Scottish Highlands – that are overgrazed by deer. </p> \n<h2>Common crane</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6901ff1feaa4d59d87cf3852b9a2d3445c83e971\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6901ff1feaa4d59d87cf3852b9a2d3445c83e971/0_0_3000_1998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cranes\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Common cranes (<em>Grus grus</em>) at a corn field near Koenigs Wusterhausen, Germany.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Pleul/dpa/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cranes were once among the commonest breeding birds on British wetlands. They persisted here until the 16<sup>th</sup> century, when they were hunted to extinction. They have spontaneously returned to the Norfolk Broads, and have been reintroduced to Somerset. The magic of hearing their wild cries as they descend from their migrations – they can fly at 32,000 feet – defies all description.</p> \n<h2>Eagle owl</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea5e5f099d33256348ca8ae3591996d2fd0fea98\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/ea5e5f099d33256348ca8ae3591996d2fd0fea98/0_122_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An Eagle Owl sitting in a tree\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An eagle owl sitting in a tree.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Queenborough/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Because the fossil record is very sparse, it’s unclear when the eagle owl last lived here. The last certain bone is about 9,000 years old, though a possible specimen from the Iron Age has been found in Somerset. Nor is there any certainty about why it disappeared. A small number are living in Britain again, either escapees or migrants from elsewhere in Europe. This vast and beautiful bird is controversial among ornithologists, as it sometimes kills other raptors.</p> \n<h2>Pine marten </h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"765dcc5034dc2d19f4d7a6b1b56a1fdcf024a170\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/765dcc5034dc2d19f4d7a6b1b56a1fdcf024a170/0_0_4288_2848/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pine marten\" width=\"1000\" height=\"664\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pine marten (<em>Martes martes</em>), adult female, in Caledonian forest, the Black Isle, Highlands, Scotland. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Terry Whittaker/2020VISION/NPL/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Following the spectacular preliminary findings from Ireland, where <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jan/30/how-to-eradicate-grey-squirrels-without-firing-a-shot-pine-martens\">resurgent pine martens appear to have rolled back the grey squirrel population</a>, allowing red squirrels to recolonise much of their old territory, there has been a surge of interest in restoring the species in Britain. While they persist in reasonable numbers in parts of Scotland, in England and Wales there are only tiny relict populations, whose expansion is limited by their narrow genetic base. Largely through the work of the Vincent Wildlife Trust, re-establishment programmes have begun in several places.</p> \n<h2>Goshawk</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b49ea76045fe92a65f1f1116322fcf11fd2909bb\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b49ea76045fe92a65f1f1116322fcf11fd2909bb/0_0_3888_2592/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goshawk\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goshawk (<em>Accipiter gentilis</em>) resting in juniper bush (<em>Juniperus communis</em>), Saaremaa island, Estonia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Remo Savisaar/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was driven to extinction in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, mostly by gamekeepers, but it now clings on in small numbers, as a result of deliberate releases and escapes from falconers. It is still being illegally killed by gamekeepers. Like the pine marten, the goshawk hunts grey squirrels.</p> \n<h2>Night heron</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"465008a4565698238388fd165280136074b32e69\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/465008a4565698238388fd165280136074b32e69/0_0_4463_2975/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heron\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Black-crowned night heron (<em>Nycticorax nycticorax</em>) catching a catfish (<em>Ictalurus</em>).</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Gooday/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The night heron last bred here in the 16<sup>th</sup> or 17<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed to be the celebrated <em>brewes</em> or <em>brues</em>, served at mediaeval banquets. Its nocturnal feeding habits could be an important factor in shaping wetland ecosystems.</p> \n<h2>Sturgeon</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e95c35400382c07e958df3750f2aa5087bf94c2\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/9e95c35400382c07e958df3750f2aa5087bf94c2/0_0_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sturgeon is photographed in a pool of the Agro Ittica Lombarda sturgeons farm, a world leader in production and distribution of caviar on March 19, 2015 in Calvisano, near Brescia, northern Italy. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sturgeon in a pool of the Agro Ittica Lombarda sturgeons farm in Calvisano, near Brescia, northern Italy. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Olivier Morin/AFP/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Of all the species considered for reintroduction here, the Atlantic sturgeon is perhaps the most difficult, as its restoration would require major improvements to both rivers and the sea. It was once a common fish in Britain, migrating through most of our river systems. It can grow to around 18 feet long. Now critically endangered by a combination of overfishing, pollution and the damning and wiering of the rivers in which it breeds, its last European breeding population is in the Gironde-Garonne-Dordogne basin in France. </p> \n<h2>White stork</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"06231108cd9023ac43fea9cffe499c173ab970f9\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/06231108cd9023ac43fea9cffe499c173ab970f9/0_134_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stork perches on a stop sign near Immerath, Germany, 15 October 2013, before continuing his journey to search for his favourite food targets - mice, frogs and other small animals. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stork perches on a stop sign near Immerath, Germany. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Federico Gambarini/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The last year in which it is known to have bred successfully in this country was 1416, in Edinburgh. Occasional birds have arrived this century, and on a couple of occasions have tried to breed. Its habit of building on people’s roofs has made it one of the most-loved birds in Europe, and generated a rich folklore.</p> \n<h2>White-tailed eagle</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"817fef73c5f8552ba53dc9f9910fc231509ef355\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/817fef73c5f8552ba53dc9f9910fc231509ef355/0_0_4064_2688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"White-tailed sea eagle fishing and catching a fish, Isle of Skye, Scotland - 2012&lt;br&gt;\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A white-tailed sea eagle snaps up a fish in the Isle of Skye, Scotland.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drew Buckley/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The white-tailed eagle once lived throughout the country, but was wiped out in Britain in 1916, by persecution and egg collecting. It was restored to the isle of Rum in 1975, and has since spread along the west coast of Scotland. Attempts to re-establish it in East Anglia failed as a result of vocal but poorly-informed opposition. In Finland, it has restricted the range of invasive American mink, that it plucks out of the water when they are swimming. This is likely to be of benefit to the many species on which mink prey.</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5c5c68dd5775b998507b04e431f557c3475bfdcb/0_266_4074_2445/4074.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2445,"width":4074,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Edwin Kats/ NIS/Edwin Kats/ NIS/Minden Pictures/Corbis","altText":"Pine Marten (Martes martes) in boreal forest, Europe<br>01 Oct 2011 --- Pine Marten (Martes martes) in boreal forest, Europe --- Image by © Edwin Kats/ NIS/Minden Pictures/Corbis","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Edwin Kats/ NIS/Edwin Kats/ NIS/Minden Pictures/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/4ff42c338125b1f6018959a826a14f8904233856/0_398_6000_3600/6000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3600,"width":6000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" Dalmatian pelicans (<em>Pelecanus crispus</em>) competing for fish discarded by fishermen in Lake Kerkini, Central Macedonia, Greece Photograph: Marko König/Alamy","credit":"Marko König/Alamy","altText":" Dalmatian Pelicans (Pelecanus crispus), group competing for fish discarded by fishermen, Lake Kerkini, Central Macedonia, Greece","cleanCaption":" Dalmatian pelicans (<em>Pelecanus crispus</em>) competing for fish discarded by fishermen in Lake Kerkini, Central Macedonia, Greece","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Marko König/Alamy"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5158f4ccbe0a6f7f8388ebdaafb23b47d957aabc/0_79_4256_2555/4256.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2555,"width":4256,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An Atlantic bluefin tuna feeds in the waters of Canada’s Gulf of Saint Lawrence.

The buyer spent around 20 minutes checking the bike and told me he was going to ride it to a mountain centre 130 miles away. After his trip he telephoned me saying he wanted to send the bike back because it had chipped paintwork and a faulty suspension fork.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Ebay made a decision in his favour without consulting me and told me to refund him. I refused, so it has refunded the buyer and is now pursuing me. When the bike arrived back I found the brakes had been removed, the suspension forks had been deflated, cables had been re-routed and the front wheel had a slight buckle. These would have been immediately apparent on riding the bike, and yet the buyer rode it on one of the hardest (in every sense) trails in the UK before “discovering” them. </strong><em>MC, Braco, Perthshire</em></p> \n<p>Ebay’s efforts to lure buyers with its no&nbsp;quibbles protection has proved a gift for scoundrels – my postbag sags with grief from sellers. Ebay denies that its dispute resolution system is automated, but the illogicality of many of its rulings suggests otherwise.</p> \n<p>In the glare of the media spotlight the company realised it had given RM an “unsatisfying experience” and refunded him &pound;687. Referring to the stolen phone, a staff member said: “When a case is opened, and this results in a different item being shipped back to you, it can make the situation even more unsettling.” No word on why this “unsettling” experience was originally blamed on RM.</p> \n<p>As for MW’s daughter, she too is to receive a refund after eBay got round to viewing the tracking records. Ebay claimed she did not respond within the required eight days when the buyer opened a case. That, says MW, is because eBay’s message informing her of the dispute simply stated it would get back to her within 48 hours, though eBay claims one email it sent did ask for tracking information.</p> \n<p>There is no happy ending for MC, however. Ebay insists to me that it still sides with the buyer, despite the suspicious circumstances. Oddly, part of its reasoning is that the bike has now been returned to MC and the alleged faults are cheap and easy to repair. Buyers do have the right to reject goods after purchase if they are found to be faulty, and eBay allows them 30 days to raise any issues – but the company seemingly realises that something is amiss here because, while it insists MC&nbsp;refund it the purchase price, it is remitting &pound;400 in goodwill for “the negative selling experience”.</p> \n<p><strong>If you need help email Anna Tims at </strong><a href=\"mailto:your.problems@observer.co.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>your.problems@observer.co.uk</strong></a><strong> or write to Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.

The year before, a father from Coventry found <a href=\"http://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/cockroach-found-banana-pack-coventry-3024518\" title=\"\">a tropical cockroach in his Asda bananas</a>.</p> \n<p>So what’s going on? Max Barclay, curator of entomology at the <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Natural History Museum</a>, thinks the increasing numbers of spiders, scorpions and other insects is partly down to our aversion to chemicals. “People are increasingly demanding crops grown with less insecticide than 40 years ago, when everything was covered in DDT,” he says. “In the 1950s, it was common for people to find insects in bananas, then it became less common. This is the cost of reducing pesticides.”</p> \n<p>Bunches of fruit provide a perfect environment for creepy crawlies to hide in, says Barclay - which also explains why black widow spiders are sometimes found in bunches of grapes. And because bananas are picked, packaged and delivered to our supermarkets as quickly as possible, the animals are likely to remain alive when they eventually find themselves in our kitchens.</p> \n<p>“You can’t really check bunches of bananas without breaking each one apart to see if something is hiding in it,” says Barclay, “because if you frighten a spider it will just go deeper into the bunch.”</p> \n<p>While the fruit is refrigerated during transportation the creatures will go to sleep, “then when they are warmed up they start wandering about again - but by that time they are in a plastic bag.”The good news is that the dangers are often exaggerated. It’s hard to identify a spider which has been squashed or scalded by a terrified shopper, Barclay says: “There is a tendency to identify any spider - or part of a spider - as a Brazilian wandering spider or black widow, because that’s what we are scared of.”</p> \n<p>If you do find an insect stowaway in your shopping, a local zoo or museum might help you identify it – or you can send a snap to the National History Museum’s <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/natureplus/community/identification/bug-forum?fromGateway=true\" title=\"\">identification and advisory service’s bug forum</a>.</p> \n<p>But, Barclay says, if you have thrown it out of the door, that’s fine too. “They will probably be eaten by a bird. I don’t think these spiders are going to live and breed here. People in Costa Rica live with these things all the time. It’s just a shock because, when you are making a packed lunch on your kitchen table, you don’t expect to be stung by a scorpion.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436896179645/4769eb4b-7821-4ae1-b186-6957d57d0430-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Guardian montage","altText":"Bananas with creepy crawlies","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Guardian montage"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T17:53:25Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T23:00:55Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":56,"contributors":[{"name":"Homa Khaleeli","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/2/16/1424092519825/Homa-Khaleeli-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/homa-khaleeli"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["UK news","Spiders","Environment"],"tags":[{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"environment/spiders","webTitle":"Spiders"},{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"}],"section":{"id":"uk-news"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Homa Khaleeli","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/homa-khaleeli"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"uk-news"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","quoteColour":"#fdadba","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/shortcuts/2015/jul/14/scorpions-spiders-lizards-buying-bananas-become-so-dangerous","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak5b","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/uk-news/shortcuts/2015/jul/14/scorpions-spiders-lizards-buying-bananas-become-so-dangerous","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/shortcuts/2015/jul/14/scorpions-spiders-lizards-buying-bananas-become-so-dangerous"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436896179645/4769eb4b-7821-4ae1-b186-6957d57d0430-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"There may be more lurking in your bunch of bananas than you bargained for.

But with the 10-year anniversary of the heist approaching, Oz fans surely hope the assailants will find their hearts, just like the Tin Man did.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7d0cb378cde123968a774c1233aa93cda31323af/0_118_2000_1198/2000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1198,"width":2000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ed Zurga/AP","altText":"wizard of oz dorothy ruby red slippers","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ed Zurga/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T17:44:48Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T18:04:49Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":19,"contributors":[{"name":"Ellen Brait","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ellen-brait"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["The Wizard Of Oz","Film","Museums","Culture","Minnesota","US news","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"film/the-wizard-of-oz","webTitle":"The Wizard Of Oz"},{"id":"film/film","webTitle":"Film"},{"id":"culture/museums","webTitle":"Museums"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"us-news/minnesota","webTitle":"Minnesota"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"film"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ellen Brait","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ellen-brait"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"film"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jul/14/wizard-of-oz-dorothy-stolen-ruby-slippers-1m-reward","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4akvj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/film/2015/jul/14/wizard-of-oz-dorothy-stolen-ruby-slippers-1m-reward","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/14/wizard-of-oz-dorothy-stolen-ruby-slippers-1m-reward"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7d0cb378cde123968a774c1233aa93cda31323af/0_118_2000_1198/2000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1198,"width":2000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An anonymous donor is offering $1m for the return of the stolen ruby red slippers from the Wizard of Oz.
