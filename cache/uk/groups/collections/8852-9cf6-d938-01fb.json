I know I have, to satisfy my need to connect with the online world out there. It’s certainly good to be part of the world first thing in the morning. But it’s not a great way to start your working day.</p> \n<p> According to the productivity gurus, you can shape the happiness and productivity of your whole day within the first 10 minutes of waking. So what are the other pitfalls at this precious time of day? </p> \n<h2><strong>1. Checking your emails and voicemail on autopilot </strong></h2> \n<p>Working through emails and listening to voicemail certainly seems like the right thing to do first thing in the morning. After all, you’re getting stuck in and it feels like you’re making progress. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society-professionals/2015/may/06/survey-state-staff-wellbeing-voluntary-public-sectors\">Staff wellbeing in the voluntary and public sectors - take our survey</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But, when you start your day like this you give away control – you get side-tracked and stop focusing on what you need to do. Often, you don’t realise it’s happening. Hours disappear, or a meeting demands your attention, and suddenly you’ve lost control of your day.</p> \n<p>Keep away from those emails and voicemails until you’ve done at least one vital job on your to-do list. </p> \n<h2><strong>2. Easing into the day with coffee, a croissant and the news </strong> </h2> \n<p>Being in a state of readiness is key to how your working day will play out. So get breakfast – healthy fats and proteins – and anything else you need to do out of the way. When you sit down at your desk, or walk into a meeting, you want to be 100% focused. </p> \n<h2><strong>3. Having a long chat with colleagues </strong></h2> \n<p>Your mind is probably most alert first thing in the morning. You’ve got focus and energy then. So this is when you want to tackle jobs that need creative brainpower rather than standing on the stairs chatting. Sure, say hello to colleagues – friendly relationships are key to workplace happiness – but keep it short. Save a longer catch-up for later, as a reward for a job well done perhaps. </p> \n<h2><strong>4. Moaning </strong></h2> \n<p>Computer taking an age to boot up? Slow journey to work? Too much to do? Perhaps a colleague is being irritating? Or maybe you’re just very tired this morning? </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/voluntary-sector-network/2015/may/07/charities-diverse-workforce-financial-gain\">It makes logical and financial sense for charities to have a diverse workforce</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s so easy to start your day with a big moan about all the little annoyances. You could go on and on bending the ear of one of your poor colleagues. But, getting into a negative state of mind doesn’t help either of you to be productive. To have a fabulous, productive and amazing day you need an attitude to match. Saying: “Yes, there’s lots to do, but I’m managing things really well” will serve you far better than a long, pointless whinge.</p> \n<h2><strong>5. Doing the easiest jobs first</strong></h2> \n<p>What a pleasure it is to tick simple tasks off your to-do list. It makes you feel as if you’re being super-productive. But when you manage your workload like this, it’s so easy to get to the end of the day and find you’ve not achieved anything important at all – just a bunch of ‘stuff’ which won’t make much difference.</p> \n<p>In his book <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/eat-that-frog-2.html\">Eat that Frog</a>, personal effectiveness expert Brian Tracy recommends taking on the most challenging task first – the great, big, ugly frog. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db9363153778f367a438c2ad06a502c3fdc2cd5a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/7/1430991482098/a7b68b0f-a3f4-4e58-a565-7d7bace2f621-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Frog, legs spread clutching a twig\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eat me.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lessy Sebastian/Barcroft Media</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Your frog is probably the task you’re most likely to put off, but it’ll also be the one that has the greatest positive impact. When you feel pleased with yourself for completing a high-value frog, your body releases serotonin, the natural feel-good drug, which makes you feel happier and more productive. You power through the rest of the day knowing the most important task has been achieved.</p> \n<p><strong>For more news, opinions and ideas about the voluntary sector, </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector/\"><strong>join our community</strong></a><strong> – it’s free!</strong><br /></p>","section":"Voluntary Sector Network","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/7/1430988841292/1d63b8f9-ac95-4260-8a68-080d9de92b07-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":" Laurie Sparham","altText":"Still from Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Bridget is ironing her hair.","cleanCredit":"Photograph:  Laurie Sparham"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/7/1430991483340/a7b68b0f-a3f4-4e58-a565-7d7bace2f621-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Eat me.

Gillian Clarke, national poet of Wales, explains why he is great</p>","byline":"Gillian Clarke","body":"<p>On 14 May, 1953, Dylan Thomas’s Under Milk Wood had its first staged reading at the <a href=\"http://www.92y.org/Poetry\">92nd Street Y Poetry Center</a> in New York. From now on, the event will be commemorated with <a href=\"http://www.literaturewales.org/dylan-day/\">Dylan Day</a>, an international celebration of the life and work of the Welsh poet. </p> \n<p>Thomas is a great writer because he wrote with accuracy and truth about being human. His language is inventive, yet stolen and re-made from every word he read, every phrase he heard. His poetry, including Under Milk Wood, which I’d call a radio poem, leaves echoes in the mind as music does, as all true poetry should. His prose shows a hawk’s eye and ear for detail; fierce, but shaped by tenderness, fearless honesty and humour. The whole man, body and mind, and the whole life are in the words. We see ourselves on the page, feel the arrow in the heart. He gave not a toss for any critical reader but himself. Music and truth, the qualities of all great writers, are what convinces us to read him, to believe him. James Joyce, one of his inspirations, is a prime example. There is no contrivance, no self-consciously “good English” in such writing.<br /></p> \n<p>But what does he mean to me? To Wales? I was a teenager when Under Milk Wood<em> </em>was first broadcast. My father, a BBC sound engineer, a Welsh speaker from Carmarthenshire, met Dylan at the BBC, and spoke about the “difficult young genius”. He turned on the radio and made me sit down and listen. What I heard changed my life. It was the real thing - alive, lyrical, funny, sad, familiar, tender, and spoken in the phrasing and accent of south-west Wales. It was a revelation.<br /></p> \n<p>In my education there were no Welsh writers, and no Welsh characters in the books I read. We were invisible and silenced. Great Literature was a far country. Under Milk Wood changed all that. My tribe, the Williams, went to the same chapels, preached in the same pulpits, farmed the same countryside as his tribe. The citizens of Llarregub spoke with the language and lilt of my grandmother, aunts and uncles: irreverent, colourful, comic, the same wild imagery and metaphor, and their way with words. Not grand words. Ordinary words. Swansea English words like “lovely”, and “wicked”, for example. “Hasn’t the price of fruit gone wicked?” confides a stranger, a woman shopping in Carmarthen. In Under Milk Wood the boys are “dreaming wicked”. “Thank you, lovely boy,” a woman might say to a man, young or old, acquaintance or stranger. In the lyrical Fern Hill, Dylan writes:<br /></p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>All the sun long it was running, it was lovely, the hay<br />Fields high as the house, the tunes from the chimneys, it<br />was air<br />And playing, lovely and watery<br />And fire green as grass.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>That South Wales “lovely” sings in Fern Hill, a speech-pattern the boy might hear as he waves to Aunt Annie and climbs the “house high hay” on the horse-drawn hay-wagon. Dylan is not short of words, using “lovely” twice. He is talking Swansea. </p> \n<p>Once, on the early London train from Carmarthen, the train manager welcomed us on board over the loudspeaker, remarked on the beautiful morning, the herons along the Tywi estuary, hoped we had packed a woolly as it was chilly in London. I smiled. I looked up, and the man opposite was smiling too. In unison we said: “The Reverend Eli Jenkins!” It rang true. “We are not wholly bad or good who live our lives under milk wood.”<br /></p> \n<p>Dylan’s father, head of English at Swansea grammar school, fed him great literature, and in his boxroom in Cwmdonkin Drive, Dylan read voraciously, filling notebooks with drafts of poems, many of which would become his most famous works, while his early stories grew, fed by a febrile teenage imagination. He read. He listened. He wrote. What he read was the work of the greatest writers, what he heard was the lilt and vitality of the word music of west Wales, his English mediated by the pulse made by that other drum, Welsh, beating in the syntax and the sound. Uniquely mingling both made him an original. He changed the language for all future poets as Eliot did, and James Joyce, and a few others.<br /></p> \n<p>Dylan’s Welsh-speaking parents spoke only English at home, and sent him for elocution lessons, as was the fashion then. (My mother, a generation later, made the same decision.) However, Dylan’s perfect ear for both the language of his education and that of his west Wales relatives heard the cadences of both. He brought into his written English the sound, traditions and the influence of cynghanedd<em> </em>(an ancient, sophisticated system of Welsh alliteration) from the Welsh he heard around him. Welsh was the tongue of his country relations. He heard it on the hearth at Fern Hill, in the rhetoric and poetry of chapel, eisteddfod and choir, the doorway of the pub. He was an eavesdropper. An English-only education gives Welsh the potency of something only half-silenced.<br /></p> \n<p>The language of his finest poems and stories drums with its undercurrent. An example lies in surely the world’s best villanelle, the poem of grief for his dying father, <a href=\"http://www.poets.org/poetsorg/poem/do-not-go-gentle-good-night\">Do not go gentle into that good night</a>, mingling classic iambic pentameter with Welsh cynghanedd, where consonants are echoed, or mirrored. In the poem, the sound-pattern of the opening d,n,t,g, is reversed in the closing g,d,n,t. (t and d are interchangeable here). It could not be more English, more Welsh.<br /></p> \n<p>At home in the boxroom at Cwmdonkin Drive, he read, dreamed and filled notebooks with his astonishingly precocious writings. At Aunt Annie’s Fern Hill – “Gorsehill” in the story The Peaches – he ran wild, got muddy, and played cowboys and Indians with his posh grammar school friend, Jack Williams. In the story he gives his whole boy-self to the game in a marvellous description of burgeoning human consciousness, until finally his whole, vulnerable boy-self and his loving Aunt Annie are humiliated and left heartbroken by posh, wimpish Jack and the even posher Mrs Williams, who “sat with Jack in the back of the (chauffeur-driven) car gazing at the ruin of Gorsehill”.<br /></p> \n<p>Gillian Clarke is National Poet of Wales.

When athletes wear <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/12/getting-shirty-classic-kits-winning-teams\" title=\"\">red</a>, they gain a psychological edge over their competitors. When women wear red, they are suddenly seen as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AUVkQs_Nxw\" title=\"\">sexier</a>. When Ed Miliband wears a red tie … actually, no, that’s a bad example.</p> \n<p>Still, if you want to be seen as an aggressive, dominant and sexy, you need to wear red. As someone who realistically is none of those things, I took this study as an opportunity to go shopping.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, I live in a relatively small town and all the good places are quite a long way off. So I did my shopping at a charity shop, spending &pound;8 on a too-small T-shirt and an ill-fitting cardigan that came up on the till as “Ladies knitwear”.</p> \n<p>But the garments themselves didn’t matter. What mattered was the colour. People would see me hurtling towards them in a fiery blaze of red, and throw themselves at my feet. They would plead for forgiveness, or declare their undying love, or vow to dedicate the rest of their lives to fulfilling my every berserk whim.</p> \n<p>So, naturally, my first stop was Caff&egrave; Nero. After all, big-chain coffee shops are known for their tendency to reward the attractive with free drinks and, dressed in my lovely cardie and never-worn freebie hat, I was the walking definition of attractive. A free drink was the least I should expect.</p> \n<p>In the end I had to pay for my drink, but that is only because the barista didn’t look directly at me. Chances are I was probably too visually intimidating. And, looking back, I was probably too intimidating for everyone else in the town centre as well, because they all either steadfastly refused to acknowledge my presence or simply walked away whenever I got close.</p> \n<p>That is the lesson I’m taking from this. Sure, to the casual observer, it might have seemed as if I was being widely ignored by every single human being I saw, and that this study is a massive crock of crap. But I knew. I knew that I was simply dominating them to such an overwhelming extent that I caused them to in effect shut down. I was too charismatic and sexy, that was the problem. I was a weapon, and they didn’t stand a chance. Maybe I should wear less red from now on.</p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431535422211/2e4ac9bd-e5ff-40e6-8432-9ad003821f4a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Teri Pengilley for The Guardian","altText":"Too charismatic for himself … Heritage rocks red.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Teri Pengilley for The Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-13T17:18:11Z","lastModified":"2015-05-13T23:00:37Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":55,"contributors":[{"name":"Stuart Heritage","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733749780/StuartHeritage.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stuart-heritage"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Fashion","Life and style","Psychology","Science"],"tags":[{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"},{"id":"science/psychology","webTitle":"Psychology"},{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"}],"section":{"id":"fashion"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stuart Heritage","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stuart-heritage"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"fashion"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/shortcuts/2015/may/13/does-wearing-red-make-you-dominant-charismatic-sexy","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48qv4","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/fashion/shortcuts/2015/may/13/does-wearing-red-make-you-dominant-charismatic-sexy","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2015/may/13/does-wearing-red-make-you-dominant-charismatic-sexy"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431535422211/2e4ac9bd-e5ff-40e6-8432-9ad003821f4a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Too charismatic for himself … Heritage rocks red.

Here’s what to do if you get caught by the buzz</p>","byline":"Lucy Jones","body":"<p>“The keeping of bees is like the direction of sunbeams,” said Henry David Thoreau, who clearly knew what he was talking about. Swarms of honeybees have appeared in Salisbury, Marlborough and Chichester, and the growing fashion for amateur beekeeping may be to blame. So, are middle-class novices <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/earth/wildlife/11600059/Middle-class-urban-beekeepers-blamed-for-town-centre-swarms.html\" title=\"\">not looking after their hives properly</a>, causing their bees to go rogue?</p> \n<p>A swarm happens when a hive becomes overcrowded, a new queen appears and the old queen and a gang of around 20,000 go on the run.

They leave the safety of the hive to find somewhere new to live.” But it can be managed. Beekeeping demands vigilance and Webb recommends regular inspections of hives.</p> \n<p>Bee swarms may look terrifying and trigger memories of a certain scene from the film <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omk6bVDzP90&amp;noredirect=1\" title=\"\">My Girl</a>, but if&nbsp;you are confronted with a&nbsp;buzzing horde don’t panic: bees stuff themselves with honey before they head off, which makes them particularly docile. These are not “attacks”. “You can be very close to a swarm and they won’t sting you. Honeybees aren’t aggressive anyway,” says Webb.</p> \n<p>If you spot a swarm, contact your local beekeeper’s association. In the unlikely event that you are stung, Webb recommends antihistamine cream.</p> \n<p>As bee numbers continue to decline, “people should be pleased to see swarms of bees,” says Professor Dave Goulson of the University of&nbsp;Sussex. “They are obviously important and if they are swarming, they’re creating new colonies and everyone should be happy.”</p> \n<p>Apart from the poor soul who has just lost half the brood. “A swarm is a disaster for the beekeeper,” says Gould. “Somebody else can snaffle them and they’re free to be grabbed by anyone.”</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431532365259/Bee-happy-dont-panic-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bee happy, don't panic.
