After a busy year teaching, I exhaust myself further by marking nearly 1,000 exam papers. The shift to online marking increases mistakes – tired eyes, tired wrists from placing electronic ticks on scripts.</p> \n<p>As I mark, I try to guess from your handwriting what kind of person you are. I judge you if you dot every i with a circle or a heart. Are you male or female? Who are you? It doesn’t matter, though: your years of studying come down to a small amount of money for me; you are simply a candidate number on my screen worth &pound;2-&pound;5, depending on the subject I am marking. I try to stay focused, knowing that this pays for my annual holiday.</p> \n<p>The monotony is broken at times by funny answers. I wish there were more of them. I&nbsp;want to tweet them but don’t for fear of being sacked. Were you trying to be funny when you said the White House was all you need to make an Act of Parliament? Do you really think a defendant walks free if&nbsp;he pleads not guilty? Someone needs to tell Gove – though maybe this is all his&nbsp;fault.</p> \n<p>Blank scripts amaze me. How can you finish your years of studying and write nothing? Did something bad happen in your life? Was your teacher off ill a lot? Will the mark I&nbsp;give you mean you won’t get into university? This mark may make you cry tears of joy or tears of anguish in August. These thoughts go through my mind, before I remember I get paid per script regardless, and I click on to the next response.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Tell us what you’re really thinking at <a href=\"mailto:\" title=\"\">mind@theguardian.com</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661217270/aaa847d8-ea6b-4e17-909d-473c519bf532-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":234,"width":390,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lo Cole for the Guardian","altText":"WIRT: exam marker","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lo Cole for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-04T05:00:04Z","lastModified":"2015-07-04T05:00:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":18,"contributors":[{"name":"Anonymous","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/anonymous"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Exams","Education","Students"],"tags":[{"id":"education/exams","webTitle":"Exams"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"education/students","webTitle":"Students"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Anonymous","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/anonymous"}}],"series":{"title":"What I'm really thinking","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/what-im-really-thinking"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/04/what-really-thinking-the-exam-marker","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49q5v","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/04/what-really-thinking-the-exam-marker","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/04/what-really-thinking-the-exam-marker"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661217270/aaa847d8-ea6b-4e17-909d-473c519bf532-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":234,"width":390,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Illustration: Lo Cole for the Guardian","credit":"Lo Cole for the Guardian","altText":"WIRT: exam marker","cleanCaption":"Illustration: Lo Cole for the Guardian"}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"The exam marker"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661217270/aaa847d8-ea6b-4e17-909d-473c519bf532-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":234,"width":390,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Lo Cole for the Guardian","altText":"WIRT: exam marker","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Lo Cole for the Guardian"}}]},{"title":"Man with a pram / My son is teething – everything is worse","rawTitle":"My son is teething – everything is worse","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/jul/04/son-teething-baby-everything-worse","title":"My son is teething – everything is worse","trailText":"His nappy rash is so bad it looks like my face did in the mid-1990s, but we’ve been through worse, so bring it on …","standFirst":"His nappy rash is so bad it looks like my face did in the mid-1990s, but we’ve been through worse, so bring it on …","byline":"Stuart Heritage","body":"<p>I barely knew anything about babies before I had one. I didn’t know how to dress them, or how to make them go to sleep. I didn’t know what went in their mouths, or what came out of their bums. I had no idea if an 8lb baby was big or small, and the last thing I wanted to do was actually touch one. But, despite this aggressive commitment to cluelessness, I did know one thing.</p> \n<p>I knew that teething would be horrible.</p> \n<p>That’s the one thing everyone knows about babies. When they start teething, everything gets worse. For some reason I’d chosen to forget this during my son’s early days; either because I was busy firefighting all sorts of other developmental landmines, or because I simply couldn’t bring myself to acknowledge the inevitable.</p> \n<p>But I can ignore it no longer. My son has started teething, and everything has got worse. Who knew?</p> \n<p>First, there’s the biting. Leave anything within reaching distance of the boy and he’ll bite down on it. In fact, biting seems like a colossal understatement. It isn’t just biting, it’s yell-biting – he screams “Aiieeeee!” as he jams stuff into his mouth, like a racially insensitive depiction of a foreign soldier in a 1950s Boy’s Own comic. And everything is fair game. Little by little, he’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OBlgSz8sSM\" title=\"\">Charlie Bit My Fingering</a> the whole world. The other day I handed him to a houseguest, and 10 seconds later he was gnawing on the dining table as if it had looked at his pint funny.</p> \n<p>Then there’s all the accompanying strife. Teething by itself is bad enough. Having 20 shards of jaggedy bone stab you in slow motion from the inside is enough for any human, let alone one that isn’t able to properly rationalise uncomfortable sensations yet. But nobody ever told me that it also sends nappy rash through the roof. That was a surprise. The poor boy’s bum looks like my face did in the mid-1990s, which isn’t something I’d ever wish on anyone. The whole thing is bizarre, like God decided to punish all his orifices at once, in the most ghastly way imaginable.</p> \n<p>This has affected his temperament. Our happy little boy is still there, still trying to smile through the worst of it like a charity chugger in a rainstorm, but it’s taking it out of him. He’s louder than usual, and needier too. And, in turn, this is taking it out of us. My wife and I are growing ever more ragged, our stares slowly getting a little more distant. It’s taking whatever remaining effort we have not to constantly snap at each other. But it’s OK, because at least we get to pass the stress on to other people.</p> \n<p>The other day, we went out on another date night – our second! This time we actually used cutlery! – and roped in my little brother to babysit. This, in retrospect, wasn’t the greatest idea given the proximity to the start of the teething outbreak. When we came back, we found the pair of them exhausted and purple, my brother covered in flop sweat and my son hoarse from crying. But you know what? We fixed it.</p> \n<p>Parenthood is a feeling of total vulnerability punctuated by moments of total invincibility. This latest development has brought the latter out in us, hard. So the baby’s teething. So what? We’ll deal with it, just like we dealt with colic and that time his belly button exploded. This isn’t our first rodeo any more. We’ve been through worse, and come out relatively unscathed. We will endure. The next few weeks are going to be horrible, but bring it on.</p> \n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuheritage\" title=\"\"><em>@stuheritage</em></a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435681313498/Baby-chewing-a-teething-r-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Having 20 shards of jaggedy bone stab you in slow motion from the inside is enough for any human.'

I respect her work and abilities very much, and if I could turn off my intense attraction to her, I would. We have a good working relationship, there is no flirting on either side, but I sometimes have to sit there with my eyes closed. My reactions feel entirely involuntary and very troubling.

When your hormones are firing, the only way that you can stop it is to step away from the situation.</p> \n<p>Consider a couple of visits to a therapist or, if for some reason that’s unfeasible, talk to a close friend who has proven himself to be both decent and discreet.

Remember, you haven’t done anything wrong: in fact, the point of talking about it (with the right person) is to ensure that you don’t.</p> \n<p>Then try, if you can, not to work so closely with your colleague.

There are children, teenagers and adults. They are singing and acting their hearts out for Simon Rattle. The orchestra is made up partly of the Berlin Philharmonic and partly of students, many as young as 10. There are four horn-players whose feet don’t reach the floor. The music is by Jonathan Dove and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsjNBVjR6EQ#t=163\">Was lauert da im Labyrinth</a>? (The Monster in the Maze) has been specially written to give as many people as possible the chance to perform within the hallowed walls of the Philharmonie.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, exactly the same scene is taking place in London where the same piece, in its English version, The Monster in the Maze, is being acted, sung and played by the full forces of the London Symphony Orchestra’s Discovery programme - the LSO Community Choir and Youth and Children’s Choirs in association with the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. They’re rehearsing for a performance at the Barbican on 5 July. </p> \n<p>And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2JU9ufEzbw\">a further 350 are hard at it in the heat of Provence at the Aix en Provence festival</a> where the full resources of the recently built Grand Theatre de Provence have been given over to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2JU9ufEzbw\">Le monstre du Labyrinthe</a> for performances on 8 and 9 July. </p> \n<p>With the exception of the two Simons (Rattle, and myself, Halsey, the choir director), the cast and the productions are completely different, as of course is the language – Jonathan Dove has set Alasdair Middleton’s English libretto in both German and French.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6524ddf8902d687bcc1bff84715767a366049d86\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435859522465/1d00d333-7aa7-4e49-aad2-56b3c0937591-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jonathan Dove's Monster in the Maze, Berlin Philharmonie\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The work was semi-staged at Berlin’s Philharmonie.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monika Rittershaus</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Jonathan and I have been commuting between the three cities since January, overseeing choral rehearsals and meeting directors, designers and managements. More than 1,000 people from every walk of life and background are working together and each institution is buzzing. And each city is fascinated to know how the others are approaching our shared opera. </p> \n<p>The piece sounds quite different, of course, in each of its three languages. The English in which the work was first composed fits the music best. The brilliant German translation maintains all the original charm and humour but needs to be sung very slightly slower because of the sheer number of consonants! (“beaten to pulp on the sand of the floor” becomes “grausam zerstampft zwischen Hufen und Sand”). The French version, the hardest to adapt to the English rhythms, feels much gentler but, again, works wonderfully. </p> \n<p>London is semi-staging the piece with all the imagination it can muster in the comparatively confined spaces of the Barbican. The Philharmonie in Berlin is a more open space and so allowed a more elaborate although still concert-based staging for the premiere performances on 20 and 21 June. In Aix, the project is fully staged in the recently built Grand Theatre. Each version is wonderful in its own way. </p> \n<p>Dove’s opera is the first of a series of annual commissioned community operas written to a brief set out by Berlin and London: 50 minutes, for a mix of professional and amateur players and singers, but with the accent on un-auditioned choirs: children, youth and adult. The model in the back of our minds is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QfRS56VzV58\">Britten’s Noyes Fludde</a> – our project came out of a particularly successful production of Britten’s community opera that took place Berlin in 2013, and was followed by David Lang’s Crowd Out last year, a football-inspired performance for 1,000 people that took place in Birmingham, Berlin and London.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e706d978e926a7d95ebd8d81ffe4f8e52152ed55\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435859670410/ba0f3d5a-c58a-4845-bd5d-926df631c2ac-460x424.jpeg\" alt=\"Monster in the Maze, Berlin Philharmonie\" width=\"460\" height=\"424\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monster in the Maze, Berlin Philharmonie.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Monika Rittershaus/PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Ours is not a new idea, but it’s a mighty effective one. Resources might often be bigger abroad, but the ideas and leadership are often forged in the passionate but underfunded British education departments – the LSO and other British orchestras are market leaders in educational innovation. We have had to evangelise for music for a couple of generations already. We all believe in it, and nobody more than Simon Rattle.</p> \n<p>Mind you, the idea of hundreds, even thousands of people singing goes back a long way. Haydn was inspired by the great Handel festivals with 900 people in the choir. He published his oratorios in three languages and expected what we know as The Creation to be performed in the mother tongue of its audience.</p> \n<p>Dramatic, huge and complex works by Berlioz, Mendelssohn and Verdi were also performed by enormous choirs. The Birmingham Triennial festival used to bring the city’s traffic to a standstill in the 19th century, requiring the country’s first one-way system to deal with crowds who were attending two oratorio concerts a day. More recently, Britten, Holst and Vaughan Williams all wrote music suitable for mass participation that mixed amateurs and professionals.</p> \n<p>Our pilot project Crowd Out, performed last year in Birmingham, London (twice) and Berlin, was a shared commission and a shared vision. The great reward was how differently each city reacted to the delivery of the score. Berlin performed Lang’s music out of doors in a very ambitious production that involved adult groups from across the city in a celebration of 50 years of the Philharmonie Hall. London, by contrast, focused on a variety of groups from the East End and included many children in a performance in Arnold Circus that brought a community together and was enjoyed by hundreds more. Birmingham did it in a modern mall situated between its two universities and reached out to groups who had never performed music before. </p> \n<p>The Dove and its successors can also be used however each city wishes. In London, it’s at the centre of LSO Discovery’s educational mission of East End inclusiveness. In Berlin, it is at the heart of its mission to get children singing. In Aix, it gives local people the chance be part of a hallowed opera festival. </p> \n<p>It’s essential to give a community opera in the mother tongue of its performers so that they can take ownership of the piece and so it can be readily understood by a family audience; Dove’s work will be translated into several further languages in the coming years. </p> \n<p>For my money, Dove is one of our finest composers. He has an extraordinary knack (shared particularly with Britten) for getting every element of the piece right. The story is attractive, full of energy, simply told and highly engaging. The music for young children is unison but challenging, set in just the right vocal range. For the teenagers it’s usually in two parts and realistic in its vocal challenges, but highly demanding rhythmically. The adults’ choral music is in up to four parts and designed to challenge but not frighten those who might be returning to singing after a long break. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, the orchestral pros are challenged to within an inch of their lives, leading a cohort of young people who, too, are challenged but not frightened. The music is a glorious mixture of Wagner, minimalism, show-stopping songs, fine melody and jazzy rhythmic complexity, and everyone is enjoying the clever humour of the text (“Theseus is clever / Theseus can box / his arrows are unerring and he works out with rocks”). Every group loves the piece – in fact, Jonathan has been feted by hundreds of autograph-hungry young musicians whichever city he’s in.</p> \n<p>This is just the beginning of an annual project of massed participation-staged works for whole communities. Our aim is simple – to give everyone such a good experience they’ll want to take part in music all their lives. And they’ll be the Philharmonic’s (or the LSO’s or the Aix festival’s) devoted followers for ever, embedding these great hallowed institutions into their daily lives. The future of music will be safe if thousands of people identify with our great institutions by taking ownership through participation. </p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Simon Rattle conducts The Monster in the Maze <a href=\"http://www.barbican.org.uk/music/event-detail.asp?ID=15838\"> at the Barbican on 5 July</a> and at the <a href=\"http://www.festival-aix.com/en/node/6611\">Aix Festival on 8 and 9 July</a>.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435859214227/d86ba0f3-aea5-43dc-b925-239bd554bad6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Monika Rittershaus/PR","altText":"Monster in the Maze","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Monika Rittershaus/PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435859523829/3487c434-8201-44c2-9d8c-67dce3e4d389-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The work was semi-staged at Berlin’s Philharmonie.
