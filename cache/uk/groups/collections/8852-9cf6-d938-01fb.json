Her latest just read, “<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2015/may/14/brexit-what-would-happen-if-britain-left-eu-european-union-referendum-uk\">BREXIT?!?!</a>” She’s also sent me wob (a wavy bob), bacne (acne on your back), consumity (a community of consumers), phygital (digital data made physical), and phablet (a combination of a phone and a tablet).</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/07/mimsy-chortle-and-galumph-alice-in-wonderland-and-the-portmanteau/\">Lewis Carroll</a> is sometimes blamed for introducing portmanteau words to the language, but he only gave them a name. Linguists call them blends, and they’ve been around for a while in English; words like twiddle (twist + fiddle) <a href=\"https://linguistlist.org/issues/11/11-1378.html\">go back to the 16th century</a>. “Yes, yes,” says my friend. “But this doesn’t explain why they’re so irritating.”</p> \n<p>Perhaps it’s their refusal to play the syntactic game. Other neologisms make use of familiar processes. In English these include <strong>compounding</strong>, which sticks two existing words together without altering them (photobomb, smartphone, fangirl); <strong>derivation</strong>, which adds a prefix or suffix to an existing word (tweetable, touchless, forumite, unfollow); and <strong>conversion</strong>, which borrows an existing word and changes its grammatical class (the noun geek becomes a verb, to geek out; on Facebook, another noun, friend, becomes a verb, to friend someone). You don’t always need to construct a new word at all: hat tip, group hug, date night, first world problem, while still being written separately, function as single lexical items (and warrant dictionary entries of their own).</p> \n<p>Words like phablet, jeggings, frenemy and mansplaining bypass all these routes. They’re essentially constructed by jamming two words together and cutting off the bits that stick out. This is related to clipping, where new words are produced by pruning an existing word (nightmare = mare, details = deets). But clippings usually remove entire syllables at a time. Blends aren’t always this principled.</p> \n<p>There is some method in their madness. Some blends combine clipping and compounding (jazz + exercise = jazzercise; wedding + admin = wedmin). Others overlap sounds or syllables the two words have in common (alcohol + holiday = alcoholiday; him + bimbo = himbo). And some chop sounds off one or both words and stitch the results together (phone + tablet = phablet, British + exit = Brexit). But it’s quite hard to formulate hard-and-fast rules for them.</p> \n<p>Is it this structural unpredictability that makes us trip up over blends? They’re not always infuriating: sometimes we notice them because they’re brilliant. If you’d coined <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/omnishambles\">omnishambles</a>, you could probably die happy. So here are some features of the best blends.</p> \n<p><strong>1.</strong> <strong>They’re semantically transparent</strong><strong>.</strong> It’s pretty easy to work out what a serviceable blend means. Himbo? Yes. Wob? No.</p> \n<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>They fill lexical gaps in the language</strong><strong>.</strong> We might not have realised we needed them, but we definitely do. Mansplaining, sexting, chugger? Yes. Phablet? No. (Sometimes a blend gives a name to something so subtle, you need a sizeable circumlocution to define it. I love how people who are obsessed with their Blackberry jokingly call it a Crackberry.)</p> \n<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>They’re phonologically clever</strong><strong>.</strong> Anecdata? Yes. What a gorgeous meld of the two words. <a href=\"http://knithacker.com/2015/05/25/the-stegatortoise-an-unusual-take-on-the-shell-suit/\">Stegotortoise</a>? Yes. The vowels in “tortoise” and “-saurus” match perfectly (in my accent, at least). Mompreneur? No. The vowels are different, and it’s not even the right number of syllables. Sexcapade? It squashes a word containing the sounds /ks/ (sex) into one containing /sk/. No wonder I can’t say it.</p> \n<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>They’re funny.</strong> This feature can trump the others. Mankini isn’t phonologically clever, but it neatly encapsulates the abject wrongness of the garment. Sodcasting isn’t semantically transparent (it means playing your music in public so loudly that others can hear it), but it made me laugh out loud; in this case, having to explain it is part of the fun. Bacne? Gosh, no. Spots are not jokes. Please.</p> \n<p><strong>5. </strong><strong>They give the language more than just a single word.</strong> A creative language user divides alcoholic into alc + oholic and bingo, a whole new suffix is born. It’s quite a productive one, too: the Oxford English Dictionary now gives 17 examples of different words ending in –oholic.</p> \n<p>In fact, this final process (called backformation) combines many of the above features. It’s semantically transparent. New words like workaholic fill genuine lexical gaps. The phonology of the best examples is pleasing (think about the repeated “o” sounds in shopaholic, chocoholic, and shockaholic). Franken- works in the same way (Frankenfood, Frankenbike), with the added bonus of being funny. And I’m watching the rise of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.pressreader.com/canada/times-colonist/20150118/281543699314574/TextView\">man- as a prefix</a> with a grin: we’ve gone from mansplaining to manspreading and manterrupting.</p> \n<p>If nothing else, this list might explain why I shun webinars and go to bed every night hoping for a sleepiphany. And the people I know on Twitter are my friends. Don’t even think about calling them tweeple.</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/28/1432837053090/23e6a519-8cf2-4ff5-ba09-bd3f3cb98582-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Is this the face of a momprenuer enduring some quality mansplaining?

You’re a young rapper who goes by the name A$AP Rocky. You once pretended to be President John F Kennedy to Lana Del Rey’s Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in a music video. You’ve made the American flag a part of your personal brand, using one as a prominent stage backdrop on tour, cloaking yourself in one on your debut album artwork and appearing in front of one on your debut mixtape’s cover. By the looks of it, you love American symbolism.</p> \n<p>The next logical step would be to co-design a T-shirt that depicts an upside-down American flag on the chest, flanked with – cliche alert – an anarchy symbol on one of the sleeves, right? Unsurprisingly, that didn’t go down so well, particularly over Memorial Day weekend. Turning the American flag upside down is code for <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/4/8\">a sign of “dire distress”</a> and is only meant to happen in the most desperate of circumstances. Wanting to sell a shirt at PacSun doesn’t count, unfortunately, and the clothing store learned that the hard way when they were inundated with disgusted social media comments.</p> \n<p>Patriots need not fret: PacSun took down links to sell the shirt and will be pulling it off the racks in their stores. As for A$AP, he’s said nothing about the controversy on social media at the time of writing. Whether the design was a comment on the state of police brutality in the country, or just an attempt to be edgy, it’s been a PR disaster.</p> \n<p><strong>Worth firing your merchandise manager over?</strong> No, because technically this tee was carried by PacSun.</p> \n<h2>Burzum’s church-burning wares</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c154b9d31730347ec0cda7da87282ae5188d6b6\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6c154b9d31730347ec0cda7da87282ae5188d6b6/0_0_708_722/490.jpg\" alt=\"Burning down the house: Burzum’s tour wares\" width=\"490\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Burning down the house: Burzum’s tour wares.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There’s nothing quite like a spot of arson and murder to keep your band in the limelight. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/musicblog/2009/mar/12/varg-vikernes-grishnackh-black-metal\">Kristian “Varg” Vikernes</a>’s one-man Norwegian death metal act Burzum has more than enough skin in the controversial merchandise game – maybe it’s the best way to stay in the headlines when people aren’t writing or talking about your music.</p> \n<p>In 2014, UK retailer Sports Direct had to remove one of the band’s T-shirts from its stock because it depicted the ashy remains of one of three churches that Vikernes had been charged with burning down in 1992 (he denied those charges). Oh, also this is a guy who served 16 years in prison for killing one of his former Mayhem bandmates and was convicted of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/jul/09/kristian-varg-vikernes-guilty-inciting-racial-hatred\">inciting racial hatred</a> in 2014 so maybe we could have seen this T-shirt recall coming.</p> \n<p><strong>Worth firing your merch manager over?</strong> Yes, although the whole convicted murderer thing lowers people’s expectations so much that it may not matter.</p> \n<h2>Kanye West’s confederate flag T-shirt</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c24230351eaf4e1dc9b05bbdb8ec64030e61d76\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6c24230351eaf4e1dc9b05bbdb8ec64030e61d76/87_0_1000_1500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Yeezus christ: Kanye West’s tone deaf confederate T-shirt\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yeezus christ: Kanye West’s tone deaf confederate T-shirt.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kanye’s Yeezus tour boasted masked performance, loads of Jesus iconography and that old American classic: the Confederate flag. To avoid dragging back you into your high school history classroom, that flag – which, when its design fills an entire rectangle is actually the army of Tennessee’s battle flag – was linked to the Southern slave-dependent states’ confederacy during America’s Civil War. For many people today, it smacks of racism and white supremacy and when hung over a bar or in a restaurant is a sort of short-hand for a place that the average black person from America’s north might not want to step into.</p> \n<p>So, of course, Kanye put it on a tote bag. He also put it on a T-shirt, and wore it draped over his shoulders and on a sewed-on jacket patch. Remember, post-Yeezus Kanye does not care about your feelings and will rile people up in order to make money. Sorry, I meant to make art. Using the so-called Southern cross in this way was obviously meant to be a way for Kanye to reclaim its significance, but maybe that’s better suited to a bachelor’s degree thesis than what looks like an Ed Hardy t-shirt.</p> \n<p><strong>Worth firing your merch manager over? </strong>No, but worth a tiring talk about why this isn’t that interesting a gesture.</p> \n<h2>Iceage’s pocket knives</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"888fdee442c4fff91c6ed32cf7eb03e134e07445\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/888fdee442c4fff91c6ed32cf7eb03e134e07445/0_55_1024_615/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Knives out: Iceage’s spiky merch\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Knives out: Iceage’s spiky merch.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In 2012 Danish punk band <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/05/iceage-review-ronnenfelt\">Iceage</a> flogged both knives and locks of their own hair at gigs.

Similarly to Kanye, he seemed to want to use shocking imagery to draw our attention to the fact that we’re all mush-for-brains sheeple blindly falling victim to the pitfalls of political correctness. Or something.</p> \n<p>It’s hard to know what else inspired him to design a shirt featuring the now-infamous CCTV photograph of the Columbine high school shooters in their cafeteria, before they killed scores of their peers and then turned their guns on themselves. In case that wasn’t enough, Palmeri added the message “shoot first ask questions last” to the back of the tee and also designed one featuring a screengrab of Edward Furlong’s neo-Nazi character from film American History X blowing smoke in a black man’s face. Needless to say, it didn’t take long before Palmeri decided to <a href=\"http://www.theprp.com/2012/08/06/news/emmures-frankie-palmeris-cold-soul-merch-store-shut-down-for-offensive-designs/\">take down the merch</a>.</p> \n<p>In his own words: “The shirts were made to be offensive. They were made so people would remember harsh realities. To say that they reflect racism or bigotry of any kind though, is absurd.” Stop, Palmeri. Just leave it.</p> \n<p><strong>Worth firing your merch manager over?</strong> Yes, although in this case it looks as though Palmeri was in charge of this decision.
