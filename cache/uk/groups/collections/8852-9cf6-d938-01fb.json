Also, more importantly, the latest step of my ongoing adventure to be less rubbish at yoga.</p> \n<p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong> Free at some gyms, &pound;10 per session at others. Alternatively, there’s a&nbsp;workout video you can download for a tenner.</p> \n<p><strong>What does it promise?</strong> A hardcore variation of <a href=\"http://www.ashtangayoga.info/practice/\" title=\"\">Ashtanga vinyasa</a> yoga that strengthens, conditions and stretches the entire body. It helps prevent sporting injuries while reducing recovery time.</p> \n<p><strong>What’s it actually like?</strong> Yoga has not let me in easily. My last attempt, where a woman on a video screamed at me for 10 minutes until I keeled over, should have been my last. But boxing yoga sounded different. I&nbsp;used to box a bit, so I mistakenly assumed that this would give me a head start. Nope. I was still four times bigger and four times less flexible than everyone else – they were all bending and lunging and transitioning with perfect control, while I was panting and sweating and wobbling around on one foot like a flamingo trapped in a canoe. The session was a hard hour – split into 12 “rounds”, each focusing on a&nbsp;different element – but it was fun. Not only did it make me want to box&nbsp;again, but it may have singlehandedly reinvigorated my taste for yoga.</p> \n<p><strong>Best and worst bit</strong> The worst bit? When I tried to balance on my hands, fell over and smashed my nose against the floor. The best bit? How great I felt afterwards. Loose, energetic, light on my feet.

Just don’t forget the sugar…</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>In this age of prolific food photography and Instagramming, it’s no surprise that the gooseberry has fallen out of favour – these fat little berries aren’t the most attractive fruit. Some blush to a reddish purple colour as summer wears on, but most are pale green, watery looking, peppered with little seeds. They have a tendency to sink into a grey-green mush when cooked. Often they’re spiked with light bristles. But if you can look past their appearance, you’ll find them a delight to cook with: sharp, sour, bright – a remedy to summer’s heat and an unlikely kitchen hero.</p> \n<p>In early summer, the gooseberries on the shelves are the young, green ones – plump but firm, just soft enough to pinch between your fingers. The sugar quantities in these recipes reflect that: a lot of sweetness is needed to offset the mouth-puckering sharpness of these under-ripe fruits. As the season goes on, though, the gooseberries grow softer and sweeter. If you’re cooking with riper berries, you might want to tweak the amount of sugar in the sorbet and the crumble filling, to taste.</p> \n<h2><strong>Sweet wine and gooseberry sorbet</strong></h2> \n<p>Because sorbet needs a hefty dose of sugar to stop it from freezing solid, it works best with fruits that can balance that sweetness with acidity. Traditionally that would be lemon, but gooseberry works perfectly too.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />450g gooseberries<br />150-200g caster sugar<br />200ml sweet white wine, such as Muscatel</p> \n<p>1 Simmer the gooseberries, 150g sugar and half the wine together over a low heat for 10 minutes, until the gooseberries are very soft. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve, pressing through as much of the gooseberry juice and pulp as possible. Discard the skins, seeds and stalks.</p> \n<p>2 Decant into a large, lidded plastic container, stir in the remaining wine and add another 50g sugar to taste. Make the sorbet sweeter than seems right, as the flavours will dull when it’s frozen. Leave to cool to room temperature. Transfer to the fridge to thoroughly chill before moving the sorbet to the freezer to set.</p> \n<p>3 Stir vigorously at half-hour intervals for the first couple of hours of freezing time to break up any large ice crystals, then leave to freeze completely overnight. Allow to soften slightly in the fridge prior to serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard</strong></h2> \n<p>A gently sweet coconut-crumble topping balances the fruit’s bite without smothering its bright flavour. And as much as I love gooseberries, a 100% gooseberry crumble is a little too tart even for my tastes. To that end, I’ve used a mixture of gooseberry and apple for the filling, the apple lending a welcome textural contrast to the gooseberries’ yielding softness, while mellowing the taste. You can, of course, cook this in a single, larger oven dish if you prefer, baking for 40 minutes or so.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69a68984a095a2abb8ff055f7fb8394ae34dc80f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438482535/00fbe552-eeff-440d-a8c2-8dd1e957ff6e-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard.

Toss the fruit together with the sugar and set aside while you make the crumble.</p> \n<p>2 Stir the flour, coconut and sugar together in a large bowl, then rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture’s sandy. Divide the fruit between six ramekins, add a thick layer of crumble to each and bake for 30 minutes, until the puddings are bubbling and the topping’s crisp.</p> \n<p>3 While the crumbles are cooking, make the custard. Heat the coconut milk until it’s just about to boil. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a separate mixing bowl, then slowly pour the scalding-hot coconut milk into the bowl, whisking constantly. Once you’ve added all the milk, decant the custard back into the pan. Stir it over a very low heat for five minutes or so, until it’s smooth and coats the back of the spoon. It’ll quickly curdle if it’s overcooked, though, so take it off the heat as soon as it’s a pourable custard consistency, and don’t let it boil. Once it’s ready, whisk in the vanilla extract and serve with the hot puddings.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake</strong></h2> \n<p>This is one of those blessedly easy cakes that you can rustle together the second the craving hits you – just summer fruit scattered through a simple pound cake mix. You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts if you want, but I think the more robust, woody flavour of hazelnut sits well against the bright fruit.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"360152a618142c01feb1829d1a11cd699efc1161\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438621227/40e964f2-cc60-41b7-a59e-af3f90f94fd4-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake: You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you can’t find the ready-ground stuff in the supermarket, just roast blanched hazelnuts at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 8-10 minutes, until toasted to a rich golden hue, then grind to a fine meal in a coffee grinder or food processor.</p> \n<p>I’ve left this uniced because I don’t think it needs much dressing up, but you could always brush the top with water icing or drizzle with white chocolate if you feel the cake needs a lift.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />125g unsalted butter, softened<br />125g caster sugar<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 large eggs<br />125g plain flour<br />50g roasted ground hazelnuts<br />1&frac14; tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />150g gooseberries<br />75g strawberries</p> \n<p> 1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 2lb/900g loaf tin with baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest together until very light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating each one in thoroughly. In a separate bowl, blend the flour, roasted ground hazelnuts, baking powder and salt, then fold this mixture into the wet ingredients until smooth.</p> \n<p>3 Top and tail and then halve the gooseberries. Halve the strawberries, cutting any very large ones into quarters. Mix just over three quarters of the fruit into the cake batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared tin then scatter the remaining fruit on top and press gently in.</p> \n<p>4 Bake in the preheated oven for around an hour, until the cake is well risen and golden. A knife inserted into the deepest part of the cake should come out clean when the cake is cooked through.

Just as few men are handsome, kind, able to complete cryptic crosswords <em>and</em> jumpstart an engine, so does the Grater promise that bit too much for its &pound;549.99 price tag. The key is finding the catch.</p> \n<p>A bike fitted with Shimano Nexus hub gears – eight of the beauties – would normally be significantly more expensive. Hub gears are the biz for anyone who wants to commute in their work clothes, because the machinery is all hidden away and there are no oily, exposed cogs. Usually they are teamed with a chain guard to protect your slacks, though that’s weirdly missing from the Grater. I&nbsp;have Nexus gears on my indestructible Fahrrad 300, which I’ve ridden without any maintenance for five years.</p> \n<p>But – and it’s a big but – hub gears are a pain to fix if they go wrong. The gears on the model I&nbsp;tested weren’t quite right from the get-go, slipping frequently when I was in the highest gear. The back mudguard refused to stay put, too, and kept catching on the wheel. Catching mudguards are one of those ostensibly small irritations that make me murderous, or at least tempted to chuck a bike in a hedge after 20 minutes. The best city bikes are fitted with a guard that could withstand a host of natural disasters. The handlebars look cheap, too, suggesting Charge blew the budget on the gears and went to the&nbsp;bargain basement for some other&nbsp;components.</p> \n<p>It’s not all bad, however. The Grater is very light for its category, and looks clean and modern. I&nbsp;took mine on a train to Rotherham (I&nbsp;know how to show a bicycle a good time) and had no problems hefting it into the stupidly small space Transpennine Express reserves for bikes. Charge saddles are always mega-comfortable and this is no exception. Far too many bike manufacturers think women won’t notice if they whack on any old blokes’ saddle, so props to Charge for fitting the Grater with the Ladle – shorter and wider than their boys’ toys, it includes a very welcome “pressure releasing” channel to keep one’s bits in working order.</p> \n<p>I wasn’t mad keen on the skinny twin downtubes. The very wide handlebars will be welcomed by unsteadier riders, but I’d have preferred something narrower so the bike didn’t take up so much space in my hallway.

Male plants live longer and give higher yields because their energy isn’t diverted into creating seeds. However, female plants often produce fatter spears, so there’s reason enough to keep them. Don’t let female plants self-seed, because that leads to overcrowding in the bed.</p> \n<p>Most modern cultivars are all-male strains. As a feminist I feel very conflicted about this – but I know, you just came here to find out when to cut them down. Although the fronds look lovely waving about in the wind, a lot of rocking doesn’t do the roots any good, so make sure you stake the bed so that the fronds remain upright and leave them till they are yellow in autumn. Then cut them back or leave them in place over winter for structural interest. Make sure they are removed by early spring in time for the new shoots. Finally, if you have the patience, wait another year before you harvest any new shoots and you’ll double your harvest the following year.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Got a question for Alys?

But the only way they could be together was with an archaic marriage contract","byline":"Homa Khaleeli","body":"<p>Jennifer Klinec never wanted a big wedding. But that doesn’t mean she expected it to take place in Iran, outside a food stall – to a man she had known for just three weeks. Nor that instead of promising to stay with her new husband till death us do part, she would be signing up for a “temporary” marriage lasting a month.</p> \n<p>Jennifer, with cropped, blond hair, a wide smile and an endearing air of bewilderment at the twists her life has taken, tells me over a coffee that she knew little about temporary marriages before she decided to visit Iran. In fact, when she arrived in the beautiful desert city of Yazd – famous for its labyrinthine old city mudbrick buildings and ancient wind towers – she was looking for women, not men. Having already travelled widely, including to Yemen and Syria, to learn new recipes, the former cookery writer was determined to find a housewife to teach her about Persian food.</p> \n<p>“I thought I would spend the whole day cooking with women in someone’s kitchen and then be on my own in the hotel room the whole night,” she says. So, when she was approached by a slightly grumpy 25-year-old man called Vahid, she was only interested in hearing about his mother, she says.</p> \n<p>“He had none of the savvy that would have made me wary. I knew he wasn’t trying to approach me for a date, he was just passing the time. He was shorter than me and looked angry – he has bushy eyebrows and long eyelashes and always looked disapproving. “I was reading a cookbook and he said his mum was a very good cook. When I said, ‘Oh great, would she let me come over?’, he didn’t seem very keen.”</p> \n<p>Despite his reluctance, the next day, Jennifer was in his mother’s kitchen being taught to cook <a href=\"http://www.epicurious.com/recipes/food/views/persian-new-years-soup-with-beans-noodles-and-herbs-em-ash-e-reshteh-em-363446\"><em>Asheh reshteh</em></a> – a herb, bean and noodle soup. Next came <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/yasmins_fesenjoon_91487\"><em>Fesenjoon</em></a> – a stew of chicken, walnuts and pomegranates – and in the weeks that followed, came dishes from the family’s home <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2014/jun/24/iran-arab-khuzestan-education-politics-minorities\">province of Khuzestan</a>.</p> \n<p>At the same time, she was learning about life in the family’s lower middle-class home, in a city that prides itself on the honesty and religious conservatism of its people. “Yazd is a whole other world. When I travel I always try and get out of the capital city to somewhere slower and smaller. I knew Yazd would be very beautiful and the food would be good.</p> \n<p>“It was very segregated – I think even people from Tehran would be surprised,” Jennifer says. “At the bakery there were separate lines for men and women.”</p> \n<p>In the evenings, Vahid would walk her home. “He was bossy and annoying and we didn’t have much to talk about in the day,” says Jennifer. “He was obsessively chivalrous and would bore me by talking about monuments.”</p> \n<p>It was only when Vahid decided to take her on a “food adventure” for a day that the pair’s relationship blossomed. Cemented with bowls of sheep’s head soup and sweet shops selling <em>pashmak</em>, Iranian candyfloss, Vahid opened up and shared stories about his childhood.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It was strange to be with a man who expected to be a virgin until he married and has almost never kissed a girl</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Soon they were stealing kisses when Vahid’s parents were out and Jennifer was sneaking Vahid into her hotel room. But the scrutiny the couple were under was suffocating. Vahid had already warned her to pretend they were cousins to ward off Iran’s “morality police”, but the couple were still stopped, and narrowly escaped being taken to the police station.</p> \n<p>“In public, it was a total nightmare,” Jennifer says. “It wasn’t just the police but the Yazdi people would say, ‘How do you know her? What do you know about her past? Doesn’t it bother you that she wasn’t a virgin when you met her?’ – all because I was a foreigner.”</p> \n<p>While in more socially liberal cities such as Shiraz or Tehran, <a href=\"http://www.theweek.co.uk/middle-east/61738/white-marriages-irans-cohabiting-couples-defy-sharia-law\">unmarried couples push the boundaries of the law, </a>Yazd was much stricter, says Jennifer.</p> \n<p>“In Shiraz, I saw couples holding hands. But in Yazd when we sat next to each other in public I had to face the opposite direction and pretend to read.”</p> \n<p>The obstacles they faced mean the relationship was immediately intensified, says Jennifer. “He was so protective of me. It was a form of courtship I had never experienced before. The fact you had to fight to be with someone – just to find a little corner where they can kiss you – there was a real meaning to relationships that you don’t get [in the west].”</p> \n<p>But Jennifer says she was always aware that their pairing did not conform to the traditional gender roles of such a conservative society. “You are the woman, but older, more worldly and experienced and leading someone through their first sexual experience.”</p> \n<p>Jennifer was used to her independence; she left her parents’ home in Canada for Dublin when she was 17. But even as a child she was expected to look after herself.</p> \n<p>“I raised myself from the age of eight,” she says flatly. Her parents were from impoverished backgrounds in Eastern Europe, and intent on making a success of their business. Their long hours meant Jennifer and her sister would be woken by a phone call in the morning, make their own way to school, and come home again to an empty house. Birthdays were forgotten or dismissed and when the family did eat together the conversation centred on business orders.</p> \n<p>“My parents came to Canada for a better life and they thought of that in monetary terms,” Jennifer says now. “Now I understand that it wasn’t that they didn’t care – they were just different.”</p> \n<p>It was only when she taught herself to cook after enrolling at a school in Dublin that she and her mother found a shared interest. Today they are very close, she says.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>People think it's tawdry but it's a piece of paper that allows you to live normally</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>In contrast, Vahid’s mother doted on him and when she was diagnosed with cancer he returned home to help to look after her, after his military service. Unemployed and sexually inexperienced, he had never travelled outside Iran, and his parents expected him to have a family-approved match, find a government job and live down the road. “It was strange to be with a man who expected to be a virgin until he married and has almost never kissed a girl,” Jennifer says. “It’s a huge role reversal.”</p> \n<p>When Jennifer’s time in Yazd was over, Vahid accompanied her for the rest of her trip. But because sharing a hotel room would have been illegal, the couple decided to have a temporary marriage.</p> \n<p>Inside the Islamic Republic, <em>sigheh</em> marriages are controversial. Critics complain that they are a form of legalised prostitution, while supporters argue that the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/iran-blog/2012/mar/06/iran-temporary-marriage-law-sigheh\">short-term marriage contracts</a> (which can last anywhere from a few minutes to 99 years) are a pragmatic loophole in a country that criminalises extra-marital sex; offering legitimacy and a right to inheritance for children.</p> \n<p>“People think it is tawdry,” says Jennifer defiantly, “but it’s a piece of paper that allows you to live normally. We both suggested it at the same time – I don’t know who said it first, but we had both been thinking of it.”</p> \n<p>To her surprise, people instantly offered assistance, says Jennifer. “Iranians love drama,” says Jennifer drily. “They want to be part of it, so now everyone was trying to help.”</p> \n<p>Turned away from the official marriage bureau because of Jennifer’s nationality and facing mounting cash demands from a mullah who had agreed to marry them, the couple were taking a break outside a sweet stall. When Vahid wandered off, a young mullah sat down next to Jennifer, talking to her in French. When he told him about their predicament, he too was supportive. “He said, ‘I remember when I was at the Sorbonne and there were all these beautiful women and my body was burning, but I couldn’t indulge it – it’s such a terrible thing so I will help you.’</p> \n<p>“He whipped out a notepad and asked how long we wanted the marriage to be and how much money Vahid would settle on me. And then he signed it … and that was that.”</p> \n<p>Newly legally married for a month, the couple spent a happy few days together. “It was like a bubble; we were in love and no one bothered us. It was beautiful,” recalls Jennifer.</p> \n<p>“Vahid would wash my socks in the sink every night and we ate all these amazing things together sharing the same plate, which is a very Persian thing to do.”</p> \n<p>But when the pair returned to Yazd – and Vahid’s parents – the bubble burst.</p> \n<p>“I thought because they knew me and liked me they wouldn’t mind. And if his family were OK with it, then maybe we had some longevity,” says Jennifer. “Maybe I would move to Iran – but as soon as we got off the train, I felt uncomfortable.</p> \n<p>“Vahid asked his mum how she would feel if we were to marry one day. She didn’t reply at first and I heard him say, ‘Mama …’ I heard her say no. She said it with such finality that I felt tears welling up. It felt like I had been punched in the stomach and everything was collapsing inside me.”</p> \n<p>A few days later, Jennifer left Iran. “Even at the airport we couldn’t kiss each other goodbye or hug. So he sang to me to try and comfort me.”</p> \n<p>The couple agreed to meet again in Istanbul, and Vahid finally told his parents about their temporary marriage.</p> \n<p>“His mother screamed and swore saying ‘Damn me for ever letting that woman into my house.’ While his father treated it like it was a conquest.”</p> \n<p>When they realised their son planned to see Jennifer again, they were even more furious. “His father sat with him and said ‘You will never be able to forgive her for not being a virgin. You can’t live in peace with her.’</p> \n<p>“His mother said it would give her a heart attack and they would disown him. That’s the only time I tried to end it. I thought I couldn’t come between him and his family – not on the basis of one month.”</p> \n<p>Yet Jennifer and Vahid continued to speak every day – and when Vahid got a job and flat in Tehran, Jennifer visited him. Finally – five years ago – they decided it was time for Vahid to move to the UK.</p> \n<p>Six months later they were “remarried” – this time in the more prosaic location of a register office. Five years later, Jennifer says Vahid’s parents have softened slightly, but fears that the damage they have done to their relationship means discussions over whether they will ever have children remain fraught.</p> \n<p>But she says Vahid loves the multiculturalism of London, the blending of its history and modernity and the friends he has made in the UK. Looking back, Jennifer says she is surprised when people expect her to be ashamed of her temporary marriage.</p> \n<p>“Life is an experiment,” she says. “Anything worth having is worth fighting for.”</p> \n<p><em>The Temporary Bride: A Memoir of Love and Food in Iran by Jennifer Klinec is published by Virago, &pound;13.99.

The tradition is said to be pre-Islamic and proponents argue that they continued to be acceptable in the early years of Islam during times of war, or as a pragmatic solution for pilgrims and travellers who were away from home for long periods.</p> \n<p>They were eventually banned by the second caliph, whose authority Shia Muslims rejected in favour of the prophet’s son-in-law. And since the revolution in 1979, some of Iran’s ruling clergy have enthusiastically encouraged them.</p> \n<p>Supporters say they are a pragmatic solution to Iran’s strict ban on extra-marital sex, which can be severely punished under the law.</p> \n<p><em>Sigheh</em> marriages, as they are called, can last for any prearranged time from a few minutes to 99 years, and are not always registered, as a usual marriage would have to be. Couples can even conduct them themselves and they can be endlessly renewed.</p> \n<p>Some couples are said to use them before deciding – or before they can afford – to settle down permanently. There are even reported cases where young men and women who are not in relationships but want to flat share or travel together find them expedient. Others say they are also a useful sexual outlet for divorced or widowed women who do not want to marry again – as the woman’s family are not typically involved. While children born within them are “legitimate” and have inheritance rights. But critics maintain that they are no more than a cover for legalised prostitution.</p> \n<p>Because the husband must specify a dowry in the contract, can end it at any time and have as many <em>sigheh</em> marriages at one time as he likes, they leave women with little power, argue women’s rights activists.</p> \n<p>In Arabic they are known as <em>mut’a</em> (pleasure) marriages and critics point out that the majority of women who enter them are impoverished, divorced or widowed women who need financial assistance. And because they don’t have to be officially registered, a “permanent” wife may not know that her husband has had a temporary marriage.</p> \n<p>That is why for young, socially liberal urban couples a “white marriage” – in other words, illegally cohabiting – is seen as cooler and less tainted than a temporary marriage.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436269307123/Jennifer-Klinec-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Jennifer Klinec: 'When we sat next to each other in public I had to face the opposite direction and pretend to read.'

These are effectively body creams with a lower dose of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Dihydroxyacetone\">DHA</a> (the smelly tanning ingredient) than fake tan. The benefit of this weaker, moisturising formula is that it imparts a subtler, more natural and consequently less disaster-prone colour, and can be slapped on with some abandon and little regard. Your tan may be ephemeral (two or three days, less if shaving your legs), but the idea here is to top up daily after showering for an incremental tan that could survive an entire season of bare legs.</p> \n<p>My favourite for years has been <a href=\"http://www.superdrug.com/Dove/Dove-Summer-Glow-Fair-to-Medium-Nourishing-Lotion-250ml/p/544764#.VX_-GFVViko\">Dove’s excellent <strong>Summer Glow</strong></a> (&pound;5.25), which gives a reassuringly golden tint – no Bisto, no Tango. Almost as bargainous and with an almost foolproof glow is <a href=\"http://www.superdrug.com/Save-third-on-selected-LOreal/L%27Oreal-Sublime-Bronze-Gradual-Tan-Fair-200ml/p/426951#.VX_6OVVViko\"><strong>L’Or&eacute;al Sublime Bronze Gradual Tan</strong></a> (&pound;6.99). It has a thicker consistency that softens dry skin a treat. The colour (in two shades) is spot on. Wholly brilliant is <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Vita-Liberata-Warm-4-7-Day-Gradual-Self-Tan-Lotion-Light-200ml_1250107/\"><strong>Vita Liberata’s Untinted Self Tan Lotion</strong></a> (&pound;15). It’s the only self-tan I’ve used that really has no whiff of dampened Rich Tea, and the subtle colour fades more evenly than others – I had no patchy bits to attack with a loofah. I must also mention the ingenious new <a href=\"http://www.clarins.co.uk/radiance-plus-body-golden-glow-booster/C040102002.html?start=2\"><strong>Clarins Radiance-Plus Golden Glow Booster</strong></a> (&pound;26). By adding just a couple of pumps of this concentrated serum to your favourite body lotion, you convert it into a gradual tanner, increasing the dose to make it as dark as you fancy. </p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/7/1436271287506/Beauty-self-tan-disasters-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'A gradual tanner should prove a wise buy.'
