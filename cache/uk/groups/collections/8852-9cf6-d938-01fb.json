Or Margo, hysterical with nerves, cursing Miss Mountshaft before playing Maria in the amateur dramatic society’s production of The Sound of Music? Or Margo, wading through a sea of mud in yellow oilskins picking one runner bean at a time?</p> \n<p> If you think about Margo on paper, it’s not pretty. She’s a snob, a bully and a social climber. She’s a Daily Mail reader, and no doubt would be delighted by the emergence of Ukip. She’s imperious. She’s rude. Why do we love her?</p> \n<p> We’ve all met a Margo. There’s a teeny bit of Margo in all of us. Sometimes we really care what other people think. We desperately try to make the right impression. Of course, when we do this, it inevitably leads to us making completely the wrong impression. </p> \n<p> I admit it. I identify with Margo. I have rather a posh voice. I am tall for a lady person. I can look imperious (not intentionally I hasten to add). In fact, one of my nicknames at school was Margo. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Y-mZaphP5U\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Y-mZaphP5U?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Margo’s Muddy Moment – The Good Life\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> I warm to Margo because of her vulnerability. She may be a peacock, a princess and a fusspot but, deep down, I find her rather touching. Beneath the brittle, rather too cultivated exterior, she lacks confidence. Her clothes, her lady-of-the-manor persona and fantastic bossiness are all armour to help her navigate the battlefield of Surbiton. </p> \n<p>The physical comedy is triumphant. Keith is statuesque, elegant and authoritative. Her distinct physicality is integral to Margo. So it’s all the more funny when Margo sits on a vibrating chair or falls over in the mud. Her pride has a long way to fall. For me, the best comedy mixes pathos with laugh-out-loud gags. Penelope Keith is so good at this. Her nuanced portrayal of Margo’s triumphs and humiliations means that she is a rounded and sympathetic character when she so easily could have been a one-dimensional surburban harridan.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAh2xAhEbuQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAh2xAhEbuQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Tom and Barbara’s home-made wine … The Good Life\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> I strive for this sort of quality in my comedy characters. I confess, I’ve produced plenty of unrounded characters who can exist successfully for only one, maybe two sketches. But, every so often, I find a goody – a Margo – who can run and run and never get boring.</p> \n<p> A couple of years ago I went to a birthday party. The theme was The Good Life. We all know that Barbara is adorable, pert and doe eyed. Felicity Kendal became a massive sex symbol due to The Good Life. However, at the party, there were surprisingly few Barbaras. But there were at least 30 Margos. Magnificent and hilarious in equal measure. </p> \n<p> </p> \n<ul> \n <li>Charlotte McDougall is performing at Underbelly Cowgate throughout the Edinburgh fringe as <a href=\"http://www.underbellyedinburgh.co.uk/whats-on/gay-furnish-flirt-coach\">Gay Furnish: Flirt Coach</a><br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Stage","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436284596707/033e47c7-b15f-472a-bbd1-7ce235d3f321-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Allstar/BBC/Sportsphoto Ltd","altText":"Penelope Keith on The Good Life","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Allstar/BBC/Sportsphoto Ltd"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-08T06:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-07-08T06:00:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":32,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Comedy","Stage","Culture","Comedy","Comedy","Television","Television & radio"],"tags":[{"id":"stage/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy"},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/comedy","webTitle":"Comedy"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"}],"section":{"id":"stage"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"Comedy heroes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/stage/series/comedy-heroes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"stage"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2015/jul/08/charlotte-mcdougall-on-penelope-keith-margo-good-life-comedy-hero","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ae7g","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/stage/2015/jul/08/charlotte-mcdougall-on-penelope-keith-margo-good-life-comedy-hero","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/08/charlotte-mcdougall-on-penelope-keith-margo-good-life-comedy-hero"},"shouldHideAdverts":false},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"'We've all met a Margo'"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436284596707/033e47c7-b15f-472a-bbd1-7ce235d3f321-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Allstar/BBC/Sportsphoto Ltd","altText":"Penelope Keith on The Good Life","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Allstar/BBC/Sportsphoto Ltd"}}]},{"title":"Star Wars spin-off / Darth Vader set to return","rawTitle":"Darth Vader set to return","item":{"type":"article","id":"film/2015/jul/08/darth-vader-set-to-return-in-star-wars-rogue-one","title":"Darth Vader set to return in Star Wars: Rogue One","trailText":"Evil Sith lord rumoured to reappear in Gareth Edwards’ film, which centres on a group of rebels vying to steal plans to the first Death Star","standFirst":"<p>Evil Sith lord rumoured to reappear in Gareth Edwards’ film, which centres on a group of rebels vying to steal plans to the first Death Star</p>","byline":"Ben Child","body":"<p>Darth Vader will return in the Star Wars spin-off movie Rogue One, <a href=\"http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/07/07/darth-vader-will-menace-the-heroes-in-star-wars-anthology-rogue-one\">according to Birth.Movies.Death</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>The fan site’s Devin Faraci, formerly of the generally reliable Badass Digest, reports the long-running space saga’s most iconic villain will have a string-pulling background role in Gareth Edwards’ film.

police</p>","byline":"Paula Cocozza","body":"<p>For centuries, man has explored new ways to fly. On Sunday, Danny Boria, of Calgary, Canada, came up with a precise and domestically available answer: 120 party balloons, each 6ft in circumference, filled with helium and tied to a garden chair. “It was the funniest aircraft we could make,” he says. He flew freely for 20 to 30 minutes. Is&nbsp;it really so easy to fly? Sticking with the domestic theme, could you send even a shed or summerhouse into the sky?</p> \n<p>“If you’ve got sufficient helium, you can lift anything,” says <a href=\"https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/about/people-and-resources/academic-profiles/satm-ac-profile/professor-kevin-kp-garry.html\" title=\"\">Kevin Garry</a>, professor of experimental aerodynamics at Cranfield University. This sounds straightforward. A&nbsp;bit like the film <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/up\" title=\"\">Up</a>. Large party <a href=\"http://giantballoons.co.uk\" title=\"\">balloons</a> are easy to source. So is helium, if you can afford it (Boria spent $12,000 on a pallet and a half). But how do you know how many balloons you need? “There are buoyancy equations,” says Garry. It’s a matter of applying <a href=\"http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/question185.htm\" title=\"\">helium’s lifting power</a> – roughly a gram per litre – to your own weight.</p> \n<p>That’s what Boria did. He tested the load-bearing capacity of a single balloon with “a bunch of little weights”. Each balloon could carry 3-4lb. Next he calculated the number required for his own bodyweight (195lb), his parachute and the chair. “And then I added a couple hundred pounds”, as a precaution. He also talked to “experts on wind. We figured if we did it right, if we got enough helium and enough balloons, there’s no way it won’t work.”</p> \n<p>Some have suggested <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337960/\" title=\"\">Danny Deckchair</a> was Boria’s inspiration, a film in which <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/film/rhys-ifans\" title=\"\">Rhys Ifans</a> floats off to find true love. But Boria was not looking for love. He was looking to advertise his cleaning company, <a href=\"http://allcleannatural.ca\" title=\"\">All Clean Natural</a>, which makes chemical-free products. He spent $30,000 on the stunt but the company has taken “upwards of 15,000 orders” since Sunday, he says. “We didn’t lose sight of the whole vision. We kept solving problems, and the idea just kept getting better. In business, you really need to follow your effort.”</p> \n<p>Initially, Boria planned to jump out of an aeroplane, with an All Clean Natural logo on his parachute. “We tried everyone,” he says. But no local pilot was prepared to risk their licence. His balloon idea seems novel, but it has precursors. In 2008, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/news/blog/2008/jul/07/balloonman\" title=\"\">Kent Couch</a>, from Oregon, travelled 200 miles in a balloon-and-deckchair combo. Before that, there was Roald Dahl’s The Twits, written in 1979, in which Mr Twit ties balloons to&nbsp;Mrs Twit’s arms. Boria said he heard popping sounds during his journey and eventually bailed out of his chair using his parachute. He had learned to skydive especially, but there was no dummy run – “It was too expensive.”</p> \n<p>In addition to balloons bursting, there was one further flight hazard. Boria spent Sunday night in jail. He has been charged with “mischief” - other charges are pending - for leaving an unpiloted garden chair flying around. It came down 50km south, in High River Alberta.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282997773/812d1d3a-bec6-4b17-a3af-124f23e20751-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"© Canada All Clean Natural/Canada All Clean Natural","altText":"Danny Boria's balloons","cleanCredit":"Photograph: © Canada All Clean Natural/Canada All Clean Natural"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T17:40:47Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T23:00:53Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":30,"contributors":[{"name":"Paula Cocozza","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/paulacocozza"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Air transport","Canada","Americas","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"world/air-transport","webTitle":"Air transport"},{"id":"world/canada","webTitle":"Canada"},{"id":"world/americas","webTitle":"Americas"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Paula Cocozza","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/paulacocozza"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/shortcuts/2015/jul/07/life-imitating-up-120-helium-balloons-garden-chair-danny-boria","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aej9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/shortcuts/2015/jul/07/life-imitating-up-120-helium-balloons-garden-chair-danny-boria","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/shortcuts/2015/jul/07/life-imitating-up-120-helium-balloons-garden-chair-danny-boria"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457425336","source":"All Clean Natural ","durationInSeconds":44,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/07/07/150707Balloons.m3u8"},{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/07/07/150707Balloons_desk.mp4"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2015/7/7/1436261407192/KP_344382_crop_1200x720.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":720,"width":1200,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"620x372 trailpic for Canadian flies above Calgary attached to helium balloons - video","credit":"guardian.co.uk","altText":"620x372 trailpic for Canadian flies above Calgary attached to helium balloons - video","cleanCaption":"620x372 trailpic for Canadian flies above Calgary attached to helium balloons - video"}}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Life imitating Up"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436282997773/812d1d3a-bec6-4b17-a3af-124f23e20751-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":600,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"© Canada All Clean Natural/Canada All Clean Natural","altText":"Danny Boria's balloons","cleanCredit":"Photograph: © Canada All Clean Natural/Canada All Clean Natural"}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-07-08T08:11:48Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/8852-9cf6-d938-01fb","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/8852-9cf6-d938-01fb"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"front"}
