But does it work? ","standFirst":"<p>Rob Tong created SleepHero after too many caffeine-fuelled nights trying to comfort his sleepless son. But does it work? </p>","byline":"Eleanor Tucker","body":"<p>When app developer Rob Tong’s son Freddie was born, he’d proudly tell his friends what a great sleeper his baby was. But many babies are during the newborn phase – they sleep most of the time anyway and are usually in the same room as their parents, comforted by their murmurs in the background.</p> \n<p>Then Freddie hit the 12-month mark, moved into his own room, and decided he wasn’t going to shut his eyes without a lot of coaxing. Tong had to get used to existing on a lot less little sleep. And the only thing that seemed to soothe his fretful son was the sound of his “rubbish” singing: “So I started recording my warblings on a Dictaphone, laying it down by the cot and then creeping out of the room.” </p> \n<p>But being an app developer, it wasn’t long before Tong realised he could create something himself that would work a lot more effectively. Driven to distraction by lack of sleep, Tong came up with a sound-activated mobile app to help parents settle their children when they wake in the night. And so the <a href=\"http://sleepheroapp.com/\">SleepHero</a> app was born. </p> \n<p>Apart from a few white noise apps, nothing like SleepHero had been created before. White noise often works because it sounds similar to the sound of life in the womb: a constant noise that blocks out sudden, sharper sounds. It’s even said to reduce stress in babies. SleepHero has a few on offer for free, and more that you have to pay for. Choose from the gentle hum of “Aircraft Cabin” or the soothing “Caf&eacute; Chatter”, but skip the Hitchcockian “Birdsong” and avoid “Campfire” unless you want to keep leaping up to grab the extinguisher.</p> \n<p>But it’s the next option for the caffeine-dependent parent that is so innovative: SleepHero allows parents to record their own voices into their phone – and the recording of talking, singing, or even just shushing is then automatically activated when the child begins to stir and make a noise.</p> \n<p>Rob found that his friends all had different ways of settling their children. “Some babies had songs they liked, some had repeated words, some enjoyed their grandparents telling them a story. It made sense to me to have a function that would allow you to record exactly what you wanted. I’ve even included the words to a selection of nursery rhymes on the app because sleep deprivation made me forget most of them. Then the autopilot feature effectively takes the nightshift, detecting when your child is awake and playing the audio at a volume you decide.”</p> \n<p>Rob also realised that once a baby could grab a phone, you wouldn’t want it within reach. “So the app has a sensitivity setting – the highest level is so sensitive you could leave it in a doorway. It also allows parents to set how much noise their child has to be making before it starts to play and how long their child needs before the audio ceases to loop.”</p> \n<p>When Freddie was joined by his baby sister Gracie, Rob realised he had a brand new set of sleep challenges to deal with. Freddie was now a toddler and his “big boy bed” was an exciting milestone – but it also meant he was getting wise and could no longer be convinced that the voice in the room was Rob himself.</p> \n<p>“He knew it was the phone, not me, so I tried to think of a way I could make the app work for older children. We were potty training him at the time and he seemed to respond really well to the sticker chart we used for that, so I decided to build a version into the app. It’s a simple as getting a star for staying in bed and not coming through too early. The first time Freddie got seven stars we asked him what he’d like as a reward, and he said a flamingo. He actually meant a real one but thankfully we were able to fob him off with a soft toy.”</p> \n<p>Rob has spent a year designing and testing the app, which is now available on the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/sleephero-baby-sleep-aid-calming/id952768692?mt=8\">App Store for iPhone, iPod and iPad</a>. Like most things involving babies and children, it’s not failsafe – but combined with strong coffee, it should help.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431940899455/b76057c2-f147-47f3-9632-e1eb462f8c7a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Milla Kontkanen / Alamy/Alamy","altText":"Sleeping baby","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Milla Kontkanen / Alamy/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-19T06:00:02Z","lastModified":"2015-05-19T06:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":25,"contributors":[{"name":"Eleanor Tucker","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/eleanor-tucker"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Children's tech","Apps","Mobile phones","Technology","Children","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"technology/children-s-tech","webTitle":"Children's tech"},{"id":"technology/apps","webTitle":"Apps"},{"id":"technology/mobilephones","webTitle":"Mobile phones"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"society/children","webTitle":"Children"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"technology"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Eleanor Tucker","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/eleanor-tucker"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/may/19/sleep-hero-app-children-to-go-to-sleep","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48qhm","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/may/19/sleep-hero-app-children-to-go-to-sleep","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/may/19/sleep-hero-app-children-to-go-to-sleep"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431940899455/b76057c2-f147-47f3-9632-e1eb462f8c7a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘Some babies had songs they liked, some had repeated words, some enjoyed their grandparents telling them a story.

The foam in an early 1970s Larry the Lamb toy – within the V&amp;A’s Museum of Childhood holdings – has deteriorated and can no longer even be handled; while once-slinky 1960s PVC dress has become “very sticky” because plasticers are coming to the surface, attracting dust that attacks it still further.</p> \n<p>The Tate boasts the world’s largest collection of early sculptures by Naum Gabo, the 20th-century artist who pioneered the use of plastic in art. Construction in Space Crystal, 1937, and Spiral Theme, 1941 – both cellulose acetate sculptures – are among 43 Gabo works made wholly or partly from various types of plastic. Despite storage in controlled conditions and regular monitoring, many are showing signs of degradation, including warping and cracks, due to the inherent instability of the plastics. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d87512c3adbd2ffd3ab50c42740708d251581a39\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1431993921139/ac8c0184-5342-421d-a518-95c26e70fd91-348x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Stephen Willats Mini dress: this is a 1960s PVC dress which is very sticky because the plasticers within the PVC are coming to the surface.\" width=\"348\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen Willats Mini dress: this is a 1960s PVC dress which is very sticky because the plasticers within the PVC are coming to the surface.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: V&amp;A</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The materials that he used have an in-built suspectibility to shrinkage and Tate conservators have developed replicas of these works as a visual record of the artist’s original concept.</p> \n<p>Ahead of a panel discussion on the subject on Tuesday at the Royal Institution in London, organised in collaboration with Hiscox, the specialist art insurers, Sandra Smith, the V&amp;A’s head of conservation, said: “It’s something that museums all over the world are trying to find a solution to. We’re doing a lot of work collectively to try and find answers … Plastics are such a relatatively modern material in terms of mankind, we’re on that learning curve.”</p> \n<p>She said that people wrongly assume that plastic is “stable”. It is, in fact, a “brittle” material, she added: “People don’t recognise that, when something’s a modern material, it takes time to understand [it].”</p> \n<p>Some plastics have become too delicate even to be exposed to too much light or have developed a sensitivity to cleaning, even with water. Like the most delicate of works on paper, they have to be put in dark storage between displays.</p> \n<p>Smith said that they are trying “to understand how modern materials deteriorate and how we’re going to preserve them for the future”, finding techniques to slow down the ageing process: “Plastic material is used in all kinds of design and the V&amp;A is a museum of art and design … In many of our modern and contemporary collections … it’s remarkable how much plastic [is involved]. So we’re undertaking research at the moment … to understand how light affects plastics and, I know this sounds strange, but how we can clean plastics.</p> \n<p>“We have lots of techniques that we’ve used traditionally on wood, glass and other materials that we understand. Plastics are really quite sensitive. So Imperial College are working with us to understand at a really microscropic level what’s happening to plastic.”</p> \n<p> The Issues Surrounding the Conservation of Contemporary Art panel discussion will explore the permanence and future value of contemporary art. Speakers include Sir Christopher Frayling, former head of the Royal College of Art.</p> \n<p>Smith, one of the debate’s speakers, said that it is a common problem for plasticides to seep to the surface: “Plastic itself is a material that is very rigid. The plasticides are put in there to allow it to be foldable and malleable.”</p> \n<p>The V&amp;A collection includes some furniture with polyurethane foam, which replaced traditional upholstery in the 1960s, but which has since been reduced to “just powder”, Smith said. Such examples include The Globe Chair, a polyester shell also known as the Ball chair, created by Finnish designer Eero Aarnio.</p> \n<p>Robert Read, head of art and private clients at Hiscox, said that so much contemporary art is “tricky” to restore, raising questions about its longevity and “whether that’s going to affect the market” for such works.</p> \n<p>He added: “There’s a lot of contemporary art being sold now. That’s why [this] is an interesting topic. A lot of the work is made out of innovative material, and a lot is being sold for very high prices. That’s what prompted this debate.”</p> \n<p>He believes that delicate, sensitive materials like plastic, with such inherent problems, could have an impact on values eventually.</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1431993856101/49f75328-a7ff-46ca-ae37-1dad85b2958c-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":216,"width":360,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Richard Davis/V&A","altText":"Blow up chair: this chair was originally soft and flexible but over time has become rigid and has yellowed.

It’s the moment, when director George Miller shifts gears from Mad Max to Mad Maximum, and you realise you are watching an action film determined to push things as far as possible.</p> \n<p>In the middle of a chase across a burned-out desert landscape, the Doof Warrior (a masked man in a red onesie) barrels along at full speed on top of the Doof Wagon – a massive truck. On the back: a squad of drummers pounding away on some oversized Japanese taiko drums. On the front, the Doof Warrior flies off a giant stack of amplifiers and speakers on a bungee cable harness while blasting through a series of sludge metal riffs on a double-necked guitar. The guitar is also a flame-thrower, handily. Suffice to say, he doesn’t just steal a scene, <a href=\"http://www.buzzfeed.com/adambvary/the-doof-warrior-max-max-fury-road#.qhP3av8g2\">he steals the whole film</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/11/mad-max-fury-road-review-tom-hardy\">Mad Max: Fury Road review – Tom Hardy is a macho Mr Bean in brilliantly pimped reboot</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The character, now inevitably known as “Mad Max Crazy Guitar Guy”, has entered of canon of minor cult movie characters in actions faster than you can say “That Insane <a href=\"http://www.mtv.com/news/2161513/mad-max-fury-road-guitar-player-doof-warrior-colin-gibson/\">‘Mad Max’ Flame-Throwing Guitar Is No CGI Trick</a>”. Impressive work, considering the movie has only been out for one weekend. The Doof Warrior is played by iOTA (AKA Sean Hape), an Australian actor-musician whose management company pitched the role to him as a “a mix between Keith Richards and a scarecrow”. He has form for this kind of thing.

Police warn against counterfeit cosmetics</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Last year, the City of London’s Police Intellectual Property Crime Unit dismantled a criminal operation suspected of importing and selling counterfeit goods, seizing a shipping container full of what they believe to be more than 4,700 counterfeit versions of one of the UK’s most popular beauty brands – with products including foundation, bronzer, lip gloss, eye shadow and eyebrow pencils.</p> \n<p>Fake makeup is typically manufactured in the Far East – China is one of the main source countries – and is either shipped to the UK in sea containers or simply sent via postal services.</p> \n<p>“People sell from their Facebook pages and places like that to avoid detection,” says Gavin Terry, lead officer for intellectual property with the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. “Going back a few years, Ebay was the place to look, but as it has made their site more hostile for counterfeiters we’ve seen a displacement to social media and informalised selling channels.”</p> \n<p>All the desirable brands get copied, he says, though he highlights MAC as one which he has seen aped.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"f17e6278812a6de2307d2a03401bcad8bb0e22be\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431969147734/4664f55d-91d1-4bf0-8ef1-2802ae6fe1d9-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Arsenic in a jar\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Arsenic has been used by unscrupulous criminals, but is thankfully rare.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>That said, cosmetic scientist Colin Sanders thinks it is unlikely for arsenic to turn up in your cosmetics. “It would cost money to put it in,” he points out. Rat droppings are more of a possibility, although they are “not particularly harmful in small quantities,” says Sanders – so at least that’s reassuring.</p> \n<p>Bargain-hungry shoppers may, however, fall foul of counterfeiters using the wrong amounts of normal ingredients, especially preservatives, which could trigger an allergic reaction in the unsuspecting. “Once you’ve developed an allergy to something you get it for a considerable period of time, possibly even life,” says Sanders. This means that even using the genuine product could prompt such reactions at a later date.</p> \n<p>So how can you tell if your makeup is fake? The packaging is probably going to be a pretty good rip-off of the real thing in order to fool bargain hunters, Terry points out. The biggest tip, as ever, is to apply a bit of common sense: where are you buying your makeup from? Does the price seem feasible? “If it’s ridiculously cheap,” says Terry, “it’s either going to be counterfeit or stolen.”</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431968987714/244773af-993a-41a9-be76-31099ed9f3a6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Woman applying makeup","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431969149232/4664f55d-91d1-4bf0-8ef1-2802ae6fe1d9-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Arsenic has been used by unscrupulous criminals, but is thankfully rare.

Put the latter’s ubiquity down to pure habit: while recipe writers and cooks might default to the latter, there are plenty of serious alternatives.</p> \n<p>The important things to consider when choosing an oil are the type and percentage of fat it contains, the flavour it brings, and the temperature to which it can be heated before it starts to break down and become unpleasant: its smoke point. Cold-pressed extra-virgin oils are minimally processed and unrefined, leading to more pronounced flavours and lower smoke points: they are great used as is, for dressing a salad or finishing a dish.</p> \n<p>Conversely, hot-pressed oils are filtered, bleached and deodorised, making them more neutral in taste and better suited to the hottest applications: deep-frying, searing etc.</p> \n<p>What you want to avoid most keenly are trans or hydrogenated fats – ie shortening – which are man-made enemies of cardiovascular wellbeing. Lastly, wherever possible, go organic for oils that are pesticide and GMO-free.</p> \n<h2><strong>Olive oil</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>The oil, synonymous with the Mediterranean diet, is made by crushing fresh olives, those that curdle your mouth with their unpalatably dry bitterness. Extra-virgin olive oil is fresh-tasting, fruity and grassy, often with peppery notes – perfect for drizzling on salads and finishing soups and pasta dishes. It smokes at around 165-190C/325-375F, so is definitely best for drizzling over finished dishes. Refined, it is much more bland-tasting, and smokes at 240C/465F, so while it’s still not great for deep-frying, it will do handsomely in any Mediterranean-style meal. Olive oil boasts high levels of monounsaturated fat, ie the good kind, promoting healthy cholesterol. Extra-virgin olive oils are pressed within 24 hours of the olives being harvested, ensuring a low acidity rate, and lots of polyphenols: antioxidants that may help in preventing cardiovascular disease.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rapeseed oil</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Made from the tiny black seeds of <em>Brassica napus</em>, rapeseed or canola oil is one of only two oils grown and bottled in the UK, which is one excellent, <a href=\"http://www.locavores.com/\">locavore</a> reason for using it. It is the lightest of the edible oils, boasting – at 6% – a lower level of saturated fat than any other. Like olive oil, it is high in monounsaturated fats, but has considerably higher levels of vitamin E. It has a delicate, nutty flavour that keeps it versatile. When extra-virgin and cold-pressed, it is delicious in dressings and dips, as well as in baking, frying and general cooking.</p> \n<h2><strong>Groundnut oil</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>Made from pink peanuts and neutral in flavour, this is the oil of choice for the deep-fryers of the world: its smoke point is 230C/450F. Produced primarily in China and India, it is a good all-rounder, high in polyunsaturated, monounsaturated and saturated fats, with a very stable shelf-life. You won’t want to drizzle it neat on anything special, but it will make an excellent fritter.</p> \n<h2><strong>Sunflower oil</strong></h2> \n<p>Hailing predominantly from Russia, Ukraine and Argentina, sunflower oil is made from the eponymous seeds, although the flavour of processed versions won’t tell you as much. It is a neutral-tasting oil, with a relatively high smoke point – 225C/440F – and, when used in moderation, is well suited to general cooking. It boasts high levels of polyunsaturated fats, in particular linoleic acid, which for some is not that good of a thing – opting for high oleic sunflower oil is deemed preferable. In terms of flavour, eco-chef and sustainability advocate Tom Hunt recommends organic sunflower oil for an altogether more toothsome experience. “You really taste the seeds as you know them – it makes a beautiful mayonnaise,” he says.</p> \n<h2><strong>Coconut oil</strong></h2> \n<p>The wunderkind of the wellness world, coconut is having a moment, with every other healthy-eating advocate singing the fruit’s praises. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/feb/23/coconut-oil-good-for-you\">Coconut oil</a> is extremely high in saturated fats, with an enormous 92%. And yet, apparently, this should not deter you from using it, so long as you get it virgin and unrefined. It has an intense aroma, when heated, that belies how sweet and mellow it tastes. Allegra McEvedy uses it frequently but sparingly in cooking, for “its good richness”, while for finishing a dish, she’ll plumb instead for a Mexican avocado oil – fresh and peppery. Coconut oil is rich in lauric acid, a fatty acid that reportedly contributes to reducing cholesterol and it is said to improve metabolism.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431970542992/b53194a2-19c8-453a-98ac-1443f40ba466-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Coconut oil","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-18T18:13:43Z","lastModified":"2015-05-18T23:00:35Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":87,"contributors":[{"name":"Dale Berning Sawa","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/dale-berning"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Dale Berning Sawa","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/dale-berning"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/may/18/rapeseed-to-coconut-oils-every-kitchen-should-have","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/492hk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/may/18/rapeseed-to-coconut-oils-every-kitchen-should-have","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2015/may/18/rapeseed-to-coconut-oils-every-kitchen-should-have"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/18/1431970542992/b53194a2-19c8-453a-98ac-1443f40ba466-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Coconut oil has an intense aroma that belies how sweet and mellow it tastes.
