That remains the case even if it impacts those essential things like kidney function and, erm, breathing.</p> \n<h2>Lady Gaga’s hat</h2> \n<p>The pop star is hardly a stranger to unusual outfits, but the Philip Treacy creation she wore to the Grammy’s in 2009 was a pretty spiky danger to herself – and others. As far as we know, everyone in her orbit emerged unscathed. </p> \n<h2>Skinny jeans</h2> \n<p>It was one of us, a normal person, that eventually got skinny jeans slapped with a health warning but we can blame the famous for starting it all in the first place. The most extreme trend is male celebrities like Harry Styles and Joey Essex supposedly wearing women’s skinny jeans. Both should be warned: health experts have said these super-tight trousers could lead to bladder infections and reduced sperm count.</p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435082701379/dd2653a0-1a28-4668-a708-35f6afae641d-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"G2","altText":"Dangerous

From the present you buy because it is the last thing on the list to the outfit you’ll never wear again, we reveal the hidden costs when friends tie the knot","byline":"Homa Khaleeli","body":"<p>It’s the chance to watch two people celebrate their love, make a lifelong commitment and be cheered on by their closest family and friends - if you can stomach the &pound;377 bill. According to a survey of 2000 people by the Nationwide building society, the average wedding guest will shell out hundreds of pounds for each invitation they accept this year. The survey has factored in pre- and post-celebration additions including hen nights, stag dos, new outfits, travel and hotels, with men spending &pound;51 more per happy couple. But how has the price of hearing a couple say “I do” crept up so high? I blame the hidden costs.</p> \n<h2><strong>All the towels are gone</strong></h2> \n<p>You’ve clicked on the gift list too late, all the sensibly priced presents have been bought and you are stuck with two options: pay an extra &pound;20 for the only thing left that looks like an actual gift, or swallow your pride and stick to your budget. This will probably be two silver forks that you could have nicked from the posher wedding you went to last weekend.</p> \n<h2><strong>Unwanted, one-wear-only clothes</strong></h2> \n<p>When it comes to weddings, your normal clothes suddenly look insufficiently dressy and you start panic buying silky dresses, metallic high heeled sandals or – shudder – nude tights. If you come to your senses and refuse to buy a tiny cardigan you will never wear again, you will freeze through the church service. Whatever you buy, you will have to pay extra for a taxi home because you can’t walk in those stupid heels. Men might think a suit will save them, but post-wedding breakfasts have their own strange dress code: brightly-coloured chinos and blazers don’t come cheap.</p> \n<h2><strong>Extra food</strong></h2> \n<p>Yes I know you aren’t paying for the wedding breakfast – but it’s not until 3pm. How can you not sneak off to buy something to plug the gap? And that’s without forking out for any pre-wedding dinners.</p> \n<h2><strong>Blowing away the competition</strong></h2> \n<p>Maybe the bride is an ex. Maybe you had a crush on the groom, maybe you are single, haven’t been given a plus one, and will be looked at with pity by family members all night. Consider it a tax on your ego because sometimes you just need to look amazing; this will definitely tip you over budget.</p> \n<h2><strong>Keeping up with the other guests</strong></h2> \n<p>If your friends’ friends are richer than you, you’re in trouble. One colleague says the first thing he was asked at the stag do was to pay his share for the stripper – his weekend’s budget gone in two seconds. “I remember having to walk for hours back to the campsite I was staying at. I stopped going to stag dos after that.”</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435075484775/What-price-being-there-fo-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"What price being there for their special moment?

It’s also, perhaps appropriate given that people who’ve drunk too much lager often have believe they can recreate the operatic midsection of Bohemian Rhapsody unaccompanied.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/dec/26/queen-freddie-mercury-present-throughout-show\">Queen: ‘Freddie is present throughout the show’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The link with Bohemian Rhapsody at least enables to beer to reflect lager history.

collection/corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Arthur Schnitzler’s Traumnovelle (Dream Story<em>)</em> tells the story of a Viennese doctor who attends an orgiastic masked ball, confesses his transgression to his wife the next day but is forgiven – and, in Kubrick’s<em> </em>Eyes Wide Shut<em> -</em> even rewarded with a tryst.</p> \n<p>Now, however, British academics have discovered that the original version of the Austrian author’s story had an alternative ending, in which the doctor is punished for betraying his wife. Researchers based at Cambridge University have found that the famous orgy scene was contained in a draft for Schnitzler’s<em> </em>Das weite Land, a tragicomedy later adapted by Tom Stoppard as Undiscovered Country but originally written in 1908 – about 17 years before Dream Story was published.</p> \n<p>Set around the turn of the 20th century, the published version of the story features a young doctor called Fridolin and his wife, Albertine, whose sexual fantasies belie their bourgeois existence. One evening, after Albertine has confessed her attraction to a young man she had seen while on holiday, Fridolin bumps into an old university friend in a coffeehouse. He obtains the secret password to a clandestine masked ball, where he has a seductive encounter with a beautiful stranger. </p> \n<p>He confesses his adventure to his wife the next morning, but Albertine tells him not to worry too much about the future. The well-known version of the story ends with the couple greeting the new day with their daughter.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/1999/sep/10/3\">Eyes Wide Shut</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Kubrick’s version added a more explicit touch to the final scene, with Kidman telling Cruise: “There’s something we need to do as soon as possible.” When Cruise asks what she means, she responds: “Fuck.”</p> \n<p>In the newly discovered original draft, however, the outcome is less harmonious, with the wife putting her foot down: “He confesses his adventure to her. She chases him away.”</p> \n<p>The original sketch is also less ambiguous about the nature of the doctor’s transgression: whereas Fridolin in Dream Story watches the orgy but resists the temptation to take part, the original draft suggests that he actually commits adultery. And while Fridolin embarks on his adventure while his wife is asleep, his earlier incarnation visits the ball while believing his wife to be on her deathbed.</p> \n<p>The new findings will be of no small interest to Schnitzler’s biographers: the author read a draft of Das weite Land to his wife Olga on her sickbed. A notorious womaniser in his younger years, Schnitzler later found himself at the receiving end of romantic infidelity. Olga’s affair with the composer Wilhelm Gross is said to have been the final straw for an already frail relationship and they separated.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2011/jun/22/dream-story-review\">Dream Story – review</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Revered as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2002/dec/21/featuresreviews.guardianreview11\">one of the leading figures of Vienna Modernism</a>, Schnitzler was regarded by Sigmund Freud as his personal doppelganger, because they shared an interest in the hidden meaning of dreams. Outside the German-speaking world, he is best known for his play Reigen, which has inspired a number of cinematic and theatrical adaptations, including Max Oph&uuml;ls’s La Ronde and David Hare’s Blue Room.</p> \n<p>The UK researchers are working alongside teams from Germany and Austria in the first systematic deciphering of the notes for Schnitzler’s literary works. The archival holdings in Cambridge University library amount to some 40,000 sheets, and the work of transcription and edition will take many years.</p> \n<p>The fact that the sketch of the orgy scene had previously gone unnoticed can mainly be attributed to the fact that the author had trained as a practitioner at Vienna’s General hospital and jotted down his thoughts with the proverbial “doctor’s handwriting”. Notes vary between something approaching modern handwriting, with idiosyncratic features, and German Kurrent, based on medieval cursive writing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/theatreblog/2009/mar/17/la-ronde-scandal-stage\">Andrew Haydon: Is La Ronde too risqu&eacute; for the 21st century?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>According to Andrew Webber, principal investigator on the project, there are only a “small handful of people on the globe who can read Schnitzler’s handwriting with any authority”. The researchers say they plan to upload some of the more cryptic pages from the archive to the internet and invite the public to try to decipher his writing.</p> \n<p>The papers are held in Cambridge thanks to an adventurous rescue just a few weeks after Austria’s Anschluss with Nazi Germany in March 1938, seven years after Schnitzler died of a brain haemorrhage. </p> \n<p>The writer’s works had been dismissed by Nazi authorities as “Jewish filth”. Fearing the destruction of his archive, Olga Schnitzler approached a 23-year-old Cambridge graduate who happened to be in the Austrian capital and asked for the university’s help in saving the papers. A British seal was put on the doors of Schnitzler’s study and the works were spared from the Nazi book burnings.</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434715871380/ced99782-53e7-426d-9ecf-6f34124afff7-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"AP","altText":"Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Stanley Kubrick’s Eyes Wide Shut, an adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler’s Traumnovelle","cleanCredit":"Photograph: AP"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434720603090/a4363e2e-f239-4a5f-9536-9e8f2c9a23b7-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":378,"width":252,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Arthur Schnitzler.

If we’re going to take criticism, we’ll take criticism from Premiership&nbsp;mascots.”</p> \n<p>Kingsley – you sense Shrigley has a fatherly fondness for his creation – was born when the artist met Mike Wilkins, the managing member of Kingsford Capital Management, the Californian hedge fund that sponsors Partick Thistle. Shrigley agreed to design a new version of Kingsford’s “boring corporate logo” – a rising sun – for the Jags.</p> \n<p>Shrigley calls non-sectarian Partick Thistle “the thinking football fan’s choice”, and reels off a&nbsp;list of Glaswegian artists who are regulars at Firhill stadium: “We’re a&nbsp;very literate group of fans, unlike the riff-raff who go to the other Glasgow teams.”</p> \n<p>Like most good art, Kingsley is wide open to interpretation.

A time for simple pleasures: outdoor parties, cold drinks, escapes to the beach. A time to choke one’s fellow citizens with a poorly chosen perfume. </p> \n<p>At every turn of the season, designers flood the world with new scents. But does such a thing as a “summer perfume” exist? </p> \n<p>According to Victoria Frolova of the fragrance blog <a href=\"http://boisdejasmin.com/\">Bois de Jasmin</a>, this is hooey: “The seasonal division that we often take for granted is as much about marketing as the meaningless divisions of perfume into the eau de toilette, eau de parfum, etc. It may mean something depending on the brand, but not as a universal concept. It’s just a way to get people to buy more perfume.”</p> \n<p>Still, there are solid reasons to change what you wear in the heat. For one thing, perfume is dependent on heat to work. Essentially, perfume is just aromatic molecules in a neutral medium. Once it’s on your skin, it begins to evaporate – and as the molecules leave your skin and hit the air, voila! You smell. </p> \n<p>Frolova, who has trained professionally at <a href=\"http://www.iff.com/\">IFF</a>, says that perfumers measure the volatility of the molecules to control the nature and evolution of the scent. </p> \n<p>“You first notice molecules with light weight, such as those present in citrus, pepper, herbs and light fruity notes,” she says. “The least volatile (and generally heavier) components will linger on skin much longer, some up to 24 hours: musks, ambers, woods. Temperature – of skin and of air – affects the way molecules evaporate, and consequently, the way perfume smells.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b6b8fdd9c254f61a343433be920d556bf596bc5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434998709057/419ead04-2f99-4cda-8534-19e28fb35f34-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\" Chanel Eau de Cologne\" width=\"350\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chanel Eau de Cologne.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Thus a street in midtown Manhattan can be perfectly lovely in February and yet somehow manage to smell like 5,000 pounds of rotting meat on a muggy day in July – and thus, the bottle of Fracas that you safely wear through three-quarters of the year becomes a chemical weapon in a heat wave. </p> \n<p>The usual response is to slim things down: “Citrus and crisp green scents are perfect in the heat,” says Angela Sanders of <a href=\"http://www.nstperfume.com/\">Now Smell This</a>. “They read as ‘cold,’ and they burn off quickly. They’re the perfume equivalent of a gin and tonic.” </p> \n<p>Often, these are found on the men’s side of the aisle. Sanders recommends Chanel Eau de Cologne (“the gold standard”) and Guerlain Eau Imperiale. Dior’s Eau Sauvage is another classic in this vein, an intentionally simple mix of lemon, rosemary and jasmine. A friend of mine used to dump gin into limonata and serve it at his summer parties, and it tasted essentially like Eau Sauvage smells: crisp, bitter, and the tiniest bit metallic. </p> \n<p>Granted, these colognes are often classically manly scents (lots of people will tell you that Eau Sauvage smells like their dad). If you doubt your manliness can encompass them, there are plenty of other more contemporary takes on green. Hermes’ <a href=\"http://www.fragrancenet.com/fragrances/hermes/un-jardin-sur-le-nil?gclid=CMLW587_o8YCFWjmwgod66cKmA\">Un Jardin Sur Le Nil</a> is a watery “mango” scent that contains weirdly pleasing facets of tomato and carrot; Slumberhouse’s <a href=\"http://www.basenotes.net/ID26136142.html\">Pear + Olive </a>smells like a produce aisle in heaven. Both are crisp and lightweight enough to cut through the heat without making mortal enemies of your co-workers.</p> \n<p>Then again, why be conservative? The fact that scent gets bigger in heat can be used to your advantage. White flowers in particular – jasmine, tuberose, frangipani – are known to “bloom” in hot weather. </p> \n<p>Alyssa Harad, author of Coming to My Senses, recalled an experiment with Parfums DelRae’s Amoureuse, “a huge honey, ginger lily and cardamom perfume”. She says: “On a cool day Amoureuse is very beautiful but very big – a few drops and they’ll smell you coming a block away. In the heat and humidity it blooms into something phantasmagorical, you can practically crawl inside of it. I once wore it on a dare when it was 103 degrees and 85% humidity and I felt I was hallucinating. It was absolutely gorgeous and completely narcotic – I couldn’t get any work done until it simmered down.”</p> \n<p>For those looking to replicate the same experiment on the cheap, Lush has some inexpensive and fantastically loud white florals. Lust is just about the most bombastic rendition of jasmine that you can find, and Sikkim Girls is essentially nag champa – frangipani over a woody base – with extra sweetness thrown in. </p> \n<p>Both are fearsome creatures under any circumstances, but they come alive in heat; it’s not polite, exactly, but it is an experience. </p> \n<p>Everyone I spoke to pointed out that the “rules” for summer perfume depend on everything from location to culture to personal taste. Americans might stock up on coconut scents that remind them of Coppertone (witness the fanatical following for Lauder’s Bronze Goddess); in Europe, sunscreen is more floral-smelling, and summer might smell like lavender or orange blossom. </p> \n<p>Sanders, meanwhile, is of the mind that the best summer perfume should be casual. “It makes sense,” she says. “Do you really wear your most serious clothing in summer? Summer is the time to take Fridays off, stay up late and wear cheap sandals. Summer perfumes reflect that feeling.” </p> \n<p>So, yes: relax, and have fun with your summer perfume. Careful, considerate, well-ventilated fun. </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/750d61164c48cf7536ca65b533a76fce92eb427d/0_0_4117_2470/4117.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2470,"width":4117,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bernard Annebicque/Sygma/Corbis","altText":"01 Feb 1994, Paris, France --- In 1980, Shiseido hired Serge Lutens to manage its international image.
