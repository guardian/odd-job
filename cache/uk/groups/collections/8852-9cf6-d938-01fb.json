At the time, we thought it was a bit of a waste of time, a marketing tool through which readers could submit their own dumb-ass ideas and where we could dump some of our dreariest and most futile observations that had no chance of making it into any of our subsequent books. But guess what? It turns out there is nothing you cannot monetise, if the brand is big enough.</p> \n<p>PS: As economists, perhaps we should have foreseen that possibility. PPS: Some of our readers reached that conclusion a while ago, with the publication of our third book.</p> \n<p><strong>Why do so many Americans over-estimate the probability of a terrorist attack?</strong> To be honest, I don’t really know. One possibility is that the US government spends a lot of time fighting terror. Another is that when a terrorist incident does happen, it gets a disproportionate amount of media attention. My hunch is that terrorism is just really, really scary. (SDL)</p> \n<p><strong>Why is restoring military conscription a terrible idea?</strong> Because the only person suggesting it’s a good one is <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/uk/prince-harry\" title=\"\">Prince Harry</a>. (SJD)</p> \n<p><strong>A Freakonomics proposal to help the NHS:</strong> It is obvious there is no disincentive for people to be ill if healthcare is provided free. Therefore, what I proposed to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/davidcameron\" title=\"\">David Cameron</a> was that he should send everyone in Britain a cheque for &pound;1,000 each year. If people were prepared not to waste doctors’ time with trifles such as death-related conditions, mental health issues and chronic illnesses, they would all be &pound;1,000 better off. And the government could probably close dozens of hospitals. Mr Cameron promised to take our idea very seriously. (SDL)</p> \n<p><strong>What’s in a name?</strong> Most people called Wayne end up in prison. However, our research has shown that no matter how you spell the name Stephen, you can consistently get away with murder. Thinking out loud, maybe all people called Wayne should change their name to Steven. (SJD)</p> \n<p><strong>Why do people care more about losing a $100 bill than house prices falling by 10%, making them $10,000 worse off?</strong> My conclusion is either that people are not always very rational or that they are exceedingly rational. I can’t work out which. (SDL)</p> \n<p><strong>Is cheating good for sports?</strong> After a few moments’ reflection, I am convinced that sometimes it is and sometimes it isn’t. What’s harder to work out is what makes the difference between good cheating and bad cheating, other than that really good cheats don’t get caught so you don’t know if there has ever been any cheating going on. Hmm. This is trickier that I thought. (SJD)</p> \n<p><strong>When to rob a bank?</strong> Extensive guesswork suggests that it’s whatever day works best for the robber. The main thing is to avoid choosing the same day as another robber – as then you will get in each other’s way and have to share the proceeds. (SDL)</p> \n<p><strong>If I practised golf for 10,000 hours, would I get good enough to join the PGA tour?</strong> I was reading a book that sounded like the sort of one I should be writing myself – and it suggested the key to success was doing something for 10,000 hours. I’ve always wanted to be a tournament golfer so I immediately went out and practised for two hours. By the end of that session, I did think I was a bit better. But would the other 9,998 hours result in a sufficient improvement? Hard to say, really. (SJD)</p> \n<p><strong>Should people without sexually transmitted infections be encouraged to have more sex to reduce levels of Aids?</strong> From an economist’s standpoint, the answer is an unequivocal yes, and I’m not saying that because most of us struggle to get laid. If more healthy people like me were offered more sex, it would reduce the chances of a healthy woman having sex with someone else who might infect them. (SDL)</p> \n<p><strong>Why have we called this chapter Kaleidoscopia?</strong> The simple answer is that we have run out of material for the book and have had to pad it out with a few personal stories and chats we’ve had with other rogue economists about whether they would give a beggar $10. The more complex answer comes as another question. Does anyone ever really know when enough is enough?

He was always something of a miniaturist. His first hope was to be a poet. When that ambition misfired, he took his delight in the English sentence and made a name for himself as a <em>New Yorker</em> short story writer. Finally, he brought his gifts of wit, curiosity and invention to the American novel. By the end of his career, he had become one of the most complete and versatile men of letters in his country’s history. Among many possible fiction choices – his debut, <em>The Poorhouse Fair</em>; the sensational scandal of <em>Couples</em>; the exhilarating magical realism of <em>The Witches of Eastwick</em> – I’ve picked his panoramic masterpiece, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2009/oct/17/julian-barnes-john-updike-rabbit\">the Henry Angstrom series</a>, a portrait of America compiled over four decades: <em>Rabbit, Run</em> (1960); <em>Rabbit Redux </em>(1971); <em>Rabbit Is Rich </em>(1981); and <em>Rabbit at Rest</em> (1990).</p> \n<p>Harry “Rabbit” Angstrom, who owes something to Sinclair Lewis’s <em>Babbitt</em> (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/aug/11/100-best-novels-babbitt-sinclair-lewis-robert-mccrum\">No 47 in this series</a>), is as much Updike’s fictional alter ego as Zuckerman is Philip Roth’s, a college basketball star of Swedish ancestry who has to reconcile himself, after a dazzling start, to the long littleness of life among the American middle class.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Perfect pitch illuminated every line he wrote with an airy and zestful brilliance</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>On first meeting, Harry is selling a revolutionary vegetable-peeler on commission (later, he will run a Toyota dealership), and wrestling with a miserable suburban marriage. Harry is a good man whose circumstances provoke him to do bad things. In the first volume, he leaves his boozy wife, Janice, to go off with a call-girl (but not for long).</p> \n<p>In <em>Rabbit Redux</em>, my favourite, which is set in America in 1969 (the Apollo moon landing; race riots; the oil crisis etc), it’s Janice who has left Harry. He gets caught up in a sequence of unfortunate events in which he knows he’s in the wrong, but will never get found out. In <em>Rabbit Is Rich</em>, Harry is middle-aged, with all the stresses of mid-life on his back. Finally, in 1990, with <em>Rabbit at Rest</em>, Updike plants his lovably mediocre hero in Reagan’s America, a state of anaesthesia that provoked his contemporary and rival Gore Vidal to deplore Updike’s “acceptance of authority in any form”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9da8c41c4585617df8a1f96fd233795f0ef09850\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431707330077/8d958d42-c085-4f0d-8829-5017acbf29ff-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"John Updike in 2006.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Updike in 2006.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Friedman/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is unfair. Updike’s dominant mood is of grace under pressure, of Lutheran stoicism, and the acceptance of fate. When Harry finally succumbs to cardiac arrest, he confides to his son: “All I can tell you is, it isn’t so bad.” Ian McEwan, summarising Updike’s achievement on his untimely death in 2009, compared him to Saul Bellow (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2015/feb/09/saul-bellow-augie-march-100-best-novels-robert-mccrum\">see No 73 in this series</a>) as “a master of effortless motion – between first and third person, from the metaphorical density of literary prose to the demotic, from specific detail to wide generalisation, from the actual to the numinous, from the scary to the comic”. Updike was, like all the greatest in this series are, aways the supreme entertainer.</p> \n<h2><strong>A note on the text </strong></h2> \n<p>Henry “Rabbit” Angstrom, the account of whose life and times adds up to more than half a million words, is often placed with honour, and a measure of irony, next to America’s great literary protagonists such as Huck Finn, Jay Gatsby and even Captain Ahab. <em>Rabbit Redux </em>was published in the US by Alfred A Knopf, a great literary house and a natural home for a novel that, from the title down, nodded to the Anglo-American literary tradition. Anthony Trollope (<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2014/feb/17/110-best-novels-way-we-live-now-trollope\">see No 22 in this series</a>) published<em> Phineas Redux</em> in 1873, and Updike, who was steeped in English literature, would have enjoyed the allusion. Others critics have noted its “Dickensian” ambitions.</p> \n<p>The Angstrom series had many inspirations, including Sinclair Lewis’s Babbitt. Updike, who also venerated Lewis, always spoke warmly about his admiration for Marcel Proust, though “Rabbit” has little to do, explicitly, with <em>A la Recherche du Temps Perdu</em>. Ian McEwan, quoted above, described Updike’s “Rabbit” novels as his “masterpiece”. Philip Roth, a sometime rival, declared Updike to be America’s “greatest man of letters, a national treasure”, while, for Lorrie Moore, Updike is “our greatest writer”, though she prefers his short stories.</p> \n<p>After the fourth “Rabbit” book appeared in 1990, there were later, and shorter, outings, notably the novella “Rabbit Remembered”, published in a collection entitled <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2001/mar/25/fiction.johnupdike\"><em>Licks of Love</em></a> (2001). John Updike died from lung cancer in January 2009. His archive of manuscripts, papers and letters is held in the Houghton Library at Harvard University.</p> \n<h2><strong>Three more from John Updike</strong></h2> \n<p><em>Couples </em>(1968); <em>Bech: A Book </em>(1970);<em> </em><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2008/oct/25/updike\"><em>The Witches of Eastwick </em></a>(1984).</p>","section":"Books","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/5/15/1431707013651/John-Updike-photographed--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Rabbit's creator, John Updike, photographed in the mid 1960s.

And all women are individuals, so if you get to a point where love-making is an option, stop worrying about your own performance and instead focus on pleasing her – in whichever way she prefers. She may respond best to manual or oral strokes, or she may enjoy role-playing, erotic talk or just holding hands.

Wonky synths. FX-laden screams. Lyrics sung in a completely made-up language. Out of the 200 acts at Live At Leeds earlier this month, Ghent’s Raketkanon stood out like a Belgian waffle in a bowl of muesli. The noise-rockers shun conventional song structures and give their songs human names like Herman and Suzanne instead of titles. And they’ve been known to kiss each other onstage and swallow their microphones so intensely they graze their throats.</p> \n<p>The rise of Canada’s Metz or Dublin’s Girl Band shows there is an appetite for contemporary noise, but while those groups largely replicate the sound of the genre’s 80s heyday, Raketkanon are weirder and more innovative. Their recently released second album suggests a broader appeal beyond Belgium – it’s been produced by noise-rock linchpin Steve Albini, and might invite comparisons to, say, Refused covering Melvins while Mike Patton lurks in the corner.</p> \n<p>Raketkanon are merely the tip of the Flemish iceberg, too. There are a dozen kindred groups, including Brutus, the Germans, the Hickey Underworld, Dans Dans, Drums Are For Parades, Steak Number Eight, Onmens and Hypochristmutreefuzz. Raketkanon frontman Pieter-Paul Devos insists it’s not a scene – “Aren’t scenes genre-defined? We don’t do genres” – but these bands do appear to share a gleeful sense of the absurd.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8LU5ACDwJk\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m8LU5ACDwJk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Hypochristmutreefuzz’s debut EP includes a track called Stairway To Heaven that sounds less like Led Zep than the Jesus Lizard entering a demented circus-orgy, ringmastered by Gibby Haynes of Butthole Surfers. Onmens, meanwhile, furnish post-punk riffs with spooky electronics.</p> \n<p>Even more unhinged are Zonhoven’s Bl&aelig;gger, a sludge-fuzz duo consisting of Goblin King and Treebeard, who handle drums and squealing, and guitar and preaching, respectively. One song is called Hit Me With Your Lady Spoon and their latest Bandcamp release is dated 5 May 2018, so they might even be time-travellers.</p> \n<p>Still, it’s not easy to see these bands outside of Belgium, which may explain the furore when any of them tour. “The majority don’t go abroad much, apart from a show here and there in the Netherlands,” says Devos. “It’s a matter of getting your record out internationally, and if that doesn’t happen it’s hard to tour.” Have Raketkanon received any major-label interest? “Not that we know of,” replies Devos, “but I really have to recharge my phone battery. I may have missed some calls.”</p> \n<p>With Raketkanon and their contemporaries concocting such bracingly bonkers rock, it’s about time labels started looking beyond Canada, the US and UK and memorised the Belgian dialling code. Whether anyone will pick up, though, is another matter.</p> \n<p><strong><em>Raketkanon’s RKTKN #2 is out now on KKK</em></strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCg_qO-uPk8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCg_qO-uPk8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432123140526/Raketkanon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Here come the Belgians: Raketkanon have a new way with noise.","credit":"PR","altText":"Raketkanon","cleanCaption":"Here come the Belgians: Raketkanon have a new way with noise."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-25T08:00:09Z","lastModified":"2015-05-25T08:00:09Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"JR Moores","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jr-moores"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Punk","Metal","Music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/punk","webTitle":"Punk"},{"id":"music/metal","webTitle":"Metal"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"JR Moores","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jr-moores"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/25/belgian-noise-rock-raketkanon-steve-albini","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4945p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/may/25/belgian-noise-rock-raketkanon-steve-albini","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/25/belgian-noise-rock-raketkanon-steve-albini"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432123140526/Raketkanon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Here come the Belgians: Raketkanon have a new way with noise.","credit":"PR","altText":"Raketkanon","cleanCaption":"Here come the Belgians: Raketkanon have a new way with noise."}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Belgian noise-rock"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Review / Ride – this reunion lived up to expectations","rawTitle":"Ride – this reunion lived up to expectations","item":{"type":"article","id":"music/2015/may/24/ride-review-reunion-lives-up-to-expectations","title":"Ride review – this reunion lived up to expectations","trailText":"Their songs sound more wistful but the Oxford quartet can be recognised for what they always were: a superior psychedelic pop band","standFirst":"<p><strong>Albert Hall, Manchester </strong><br />Their songs sound more wistful but the Oxford quartet can be recognised for what they always were: a superior psychedelic pop band</p>","byline":"Dave Simpson","body":"<p>Ride’s Mark Gardener was a <a href=\"http://www.musicstack.com/item/291940038\">cover star</a> in the early 1990s. The band may not have equalled the revolutionary impact of their fellow effects-pedal kings My Bloody Valentine, but crucially they had better lips and hair. More than two decades on, the 45-year old frontman sports a stylish titfer, but his cherubic looks are still clearly visible as the reformed band walk on stage to a heroes’ welcome.</p> \n<p>Once upon a time, the Oxford quartet were at the helm of the briefly huge “shoegazing” movement – so called because the performers stared down at their effects units, as if they were admiring their footwear. Now that such daft tags no longer matter, Ride can be recognised for what they always were: a superior psychedelic pop band. Opening with the driving <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4JZIfx36Bg\">Leave Them All Behind</a> and Like a Daydream, they produce their trademark, kaleidoscopic wall of sound.</p> \n<p>Where these noisily evocative songs once pulsated with the dreams of youth, they now take on a more wistful quality; that nobody has sounded quite like this for so long makes them sound weirdly fresh. It helps that the reunited quartet play them with the care and passion of musicians who made – and still make – an emotional connection.</p> \n<p>By the time Twisterella piles into Dreams Burn Down, grown men are punching the air on the balcony and yummy mummies shake their hair.

And this time around broderie anglaise is in every colour, too, writes <strong>Alice Fisher</strong>","standFirst":"<p>It is the sensible choice for anyone who wants to wear lace. And this time around broderie anglaise is in every colour, too</p>","byline":"Alice Fisher","body":"<p>Lace was a big catwalk trend for the summer, especially white lace. There were wafty ethereal dresses at Chlo&eacute; and Erdem, sexy minis at Louis Vuitton. Michael Kors, Oscar de la Renta and Marchesa did smart separates and perfect little summer frocks. Oh, but it did look pretty floating down the catwalk. But come on, let’s not even pretend we’re going to wear this stuff.</p> \n<p>You can wear white lace, but you can only wear it once. White is a colour that is only truly loved by childless people who don’t have pets, but do have a driver. People who never eat beetroot or drink coffee.</p> \n<p>Lace certainly has its place, but it’s not in normal wardrobes. Lace is for brides or twee vintage devotees or four-year-olds who don’t know any better; for the desperate for sex in their scratchy lingerie sets. Thankfully the 1970s trend, which shows no sign of dying, has welcomed back broderie anglaise, famously the only style of fabric you can convincingly poke a fag through. For some reason, this time round broderie anglaise is referred to as broderie. I don’t know if this is a provenance quibble – like the Cornish pasty or champagne – but it suits the no-nonsense attitude of the fabric. Broderie is the sensible shoes of lace. It’s practical. It’s for people with jobs. You get the hint of skin, but without the sugary girliness or “just spicing up my marriage, be right back” of lace. There’s also the knowing nod to the 70s without the trailing of flares in a puddle.</p> \n<p>And if that wasn’t alluring enough, new-look broderie anglaise goes one better. While in the 70s the fabric was almost uniformly white, now it comes in a multitude of colours. On the catwalk there was a lovely burgundy at Isabel Marant, and Valentino sent out broderie in any colour you can think of.</p> \n<p>On the high street, navy crops up a lot, but there are also lots of clothes in those lovely bright citrus colours that go so smugly with a tan. There are also a lot of precision laser-cut patterns that make the fabric look supermodern.</p> \n<p>Whistles and J Crew have embraced the trend. Go to Whistles for perfect pencil skirts or asymmetric dresses, tops and trousers in black, navy or old-school white. J Crew has really gone for colour, though my personal favourite is this almost polka-dottish monochrome Portea pattern. It’s cute without being annoying.</p> \n<p>For more traditional broderie, look to more traditional shops. Marks &amp; Spencer has some really pretty frocks and tops, as do Comptoir des Cotonniers and Zara.</p> \n<p>As usual, if you’re dubious about a trend then go small on it. For broderie just buy some shoes or a bag featuring a punched eyelet pattern. My tip would be broderie espadrilles. These shoes are back (again, of course) this summer, and I love these Kate Spade ones. They look like wicker, another material irrevocably linked to the 70s.</p> \n<p>It’s not often that a fabric comes along that’s practical and comfortable and interesting. I know it’s a clich&eacute;, but broderie: what’s not to like?</p> \n<p><em>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"https://instagram.com/aliceefisher/\">@aliceefisher</a></em></p>","section":"Fashion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432231313796/e00d3eeb-ff5b-4f15-b8fe-da7b78cac3be-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"broderie anglaise","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-24T04:59:03Z","lastModified":"2015-05-24T04:59:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":14,"contributors":[{"name":"Alice Fisher","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/alicefisher"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Fashion","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"fashion/fashion","webTitle":"Fashion"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"fashion"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Alice Fisher","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/alicefisher"}}],"series":{"title":"Style column","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/fashion/series/style-column"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"fashion"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/fashion/2015/may/24/how-to-wear-broderie-anglaise","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/493qy","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/fashion/2015/may/24/how-to-wear-broderie-anglaise","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/24/how-to-wear-broderie-anglaise"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/21/1432231313796/e00d3eeb-ff5b-4f15-b8fe-da7b78cac3be-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"From left: Per Una dress £49.50 <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com\">marksandspencer.com</a> Denim-style carrot trousers £85 <a href=\"http://www.comptoirdescotonniers.co.uk\">comptoirdescotonniers.co.uk</a> Patchwork broderie top £75 <a href=\"http://www.whistles.com\">whistles.com</a> Model wears Valentino S/S 2015, Portea skirt £140 J Crew (<a href=\"http://www.net-a-porter.com\">net-a-porter.com</a>) Jacket £79.99 <a href=\"http://www.zara.com\">zara.com</a> Leonia espadrilles £132, Kate Spade (<a href=\"http://www.shopbop.com\">shopbop.com</a>) 1971 Lucia dress £169 <a href=\"http://www.reiss.com \">reiss.com</a>  Photograph: PR","credit":"PR","altText":"broderie anglaise","cleanCaption":"From left: Per Una dress £49.50 <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com\">marksandspencer.com</a> Denim-style carrot trousers £85 <a href=\"http://www.comptoirdescotonniers.co.uk\">comptoirdescotonniers.co.uk</a> Patchwork broderie top £75 <a href=\"http://www.whistles.com\">whistles.com</a> Model wears Valentino S/S 2015, Portea skirt £140 J Crew (<a href=\"http://www.net-a-porter.com\">net-a-porter.com</a>) Jacket £79.99 <a href=\"http://www.zara.com\">zara.com</a> Leonia espadrilles £132, Kate Spade (<a href=\"http://www.shopbop.com\">shopbop.com</a>) 1971 Lucia dress £169 <a href=\"http://www.reiss.com \">reiss.com</a> ","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Fashion"},"showQuotedHeadline":false}],"lastModified":"2015-05-25T08:06:22Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/8852-9cf6-d938-01fb","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/8852-9cf6-d938-01fb"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"front"}
