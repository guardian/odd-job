I’m in a limousine, flying up an empty road by the banks of the Danube. I’m looking tense, but also sharp, due to the exquisite tailoring of my suit. The handsome military general sat next to me is frowning. “We have to turn around. There’s been an incident at the World Summit,” I say, in a vaguely Pakistani accent, on the phone to someone who isn’t there. Suddenly, there’s chaos. A blacked-out Hummer roars past us, and executes a perfect 180 handbrake skid to face us down. Two more pull up at our flank, hemming us in. Well-built men carrying automatic weapons spill out and advance on us.</p> \n<p>It feels like something out of a movie. That’s because it is like something out of a movie – I’m filming a bit part for <a href=\"http://www.sky.com/tv/show/strike-back/video/series-5-trailer\">Strike Back</a>, the all-action Sky1 television series, and the production values are ridiculous. The entire motorway has been closed off for today’s stunt, and after we’re done here some of the cast will fly off to South Africa for more of the same. The door is flung open, and a man points a gun directly at my face. “Please don’t kill me,” I sob, my accent turning slightly Welsh. He looks like a chunky Leo DiCaprio, I think to myself, a split-second before he puts a bullet in my head, and I’m thrown against the back of the expensive car door. At that point I knew my contract wasn’t being renewed.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13c381cb439163279fdd88b0c1c68f8695803b5b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432742404237/f92b034b-d4ae-471d-a69a-7a047f364faf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Losing face: Rhik Samadder's cameo in Strike Back.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Losing face: Rhik Samadder’s cameo in Strike Back.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Now, no one’s will. Strike Back begins its fifth and final series next week. If you don’t know, it’s the story of a fictional branch of British Defence Intelligence called Section 20, which always sounded to me like an article of anti-homosexual legislation that needed repealing. In fact they’re a counter-terrorism unit, whose sole remit is sending two buffed-up oafs into enemy territory around the globe to punch foreigners. Its steroidal mix of smack talk and ultraviolence was an instant hit on both sides of the pond: the show tripled Sky1’s usual viewer share for its first episode and retained most of those eyeballs for every series that followed. In America (where it’s even more popular) it screens on Cinemax, the channel nicknamed “Skinemax” for its heroic commitment to gratuitous nudity.</p> \n<p>My role in the unfolding saga was small fry, cannon fodder; aide to a moderate Pakistani general, who was kidnapped by terrorist Jimi Mistry as part of his plot to release nerve gas via suicide bombers and other terror-y stuff. After filming a few press conferences and being shot in the head, I was free to spend my time eating chicken paprikash and accidentally bumping into old women at the thermal baths.</p> \n<p>Still, I was thrilled to be part of something so undeniably masculine. The show felt like a throwback to the 80s action films of my childhood, before the balletic kineticism of martial arts and parkour became the vogue. Films featuring firearms now are likely to use them fancifully, in the style known as gun-fu: discharged in double-handed cartwheel turns or reloaded mid-air as if by homicidal jugglers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cM2_CS4x3bA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cM2_CS4x3bA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>There’s none of that for Strike Back, which has a “two meat and no veg” simplicity to it. Every series, sergeants Michael Stonebridge (Philip Winchester) and Damien Scott (Sullivan Stapleton) land in turbulent foreign waters – Chechnya, Colombia, Somalia, Lebanon – giving the impression they’ve probably run there. They unload a thousand rounds of ammunition, the terrorists do the same, and eventually the right people end up dead. It never had much truck with ambiguity. The baddies were the ones with the accents; the good guys got a faceful of tits every week.<br /></p> \n<p>The only things it didn’t set on fire were the broadsheets. After all, this was a project producer Andy Harries successfully pitched to Sky without actually having read the book. The series titles – Vengeance, Shadow Warfare, Project Dawn – are straight out of Call Of Duty. The writing is rudimentary, the acting mostly shouting. One memorable exchange between Scott and Stonebridge, during a Chechen firefight, runs: “How many of these guys do you think we can take?” “More than you.” “FUCK YOU!” (Which doesn’t even make sense, but I guess there are bantz allowances in a firefight.)</p> \n<p>It doesn’t seem unrealistic to declare Strike Back the British answer to 24, although 24 is obviously not a question. (Unless that question is, “Is it ever OK to put a hot chopstick into a man’s anus?”) They killed me off, but I still watched. Its post-9/11 world of good and evil was a simplified one, which authorised it to dispense righteous ass-kickings. There are no ass-kickings in moral relativity.</p> \n<p>The watchwords of golden-age TV are characterisation, complexity, and ambiguity. Strike Back smacks that logic in the nuts before throwing it off a moving train that’s about to explode. While HBO is a house built on complicated antiheroes, Strike Back gave us heroes, and pretty simple ones. When they’re gone, who’s going to pick up the baton, and beat the bad guys to death with it? <strong> </strong></p> \n<p><em><strong>Strike Back: Legacy begins 3 Jun, 9pm, Sky1</strong></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e7e6ced04b859f9b98d004727fe8da594683f1ca\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432743564477/38af2819-e218-4910-965f-0cd73f1f67ca-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Guns and poses: Scott and Stonebridge take a break from the mayhem.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Guns and poses: Scott and Stonebridge take a break from the mayhem.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432736553449/e1ac12f4-783a-4e01-bc2e-131aa60793cf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Hit men: Strike Back stars Philip  Winchester and Sullivan Stapleton.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432742404645/f92b034b-d4ae-471d-a69a-7a047f364faf-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Losing face: Rhik Samadder’s cameo in Strike Back.","credit":"PR","altText":"Losing face: Rhik Samadder's cameo in Strike Back.","cleanCaption":"Losing face: Rhik Samadder’s cameo in Strike Back."},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/27/1432743565938/38af2819-e218-4910-965f-0cd73f1f67ca-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Guns and poses: Scott and Stonebridge take a break from the mayhem.

The way you want to access money is via a new method catchily titled Uncrystallised Funds Pension Lump Sum route (usually pronounced Ufplus) which allows you to do it without converting it to an income drawdown product.</p> \n<p>Says a spokesperson: “On review, we accept that we misunderstood this particular request to access funds within her existing pension, which does not require advice.” </p> \n<p>Given the new freedoms to cash in pension policies, and the onus on pension companies to ensure customers know what they are doing, yours is likely to be the first among many cases.
