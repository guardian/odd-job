Clutter ‚Äì covers crammed with words or images (Emma Healey, Jessie Burton) ‚Äì is this season‚Äôs trend.

excess</p>","byline":"Graeme Virtue","body":"<p>In 2015, most pop stars strive to break the internet. Taylor Swift seems intent on fixing it. She zaps trolls by broadcasting positivity to millions of fans on her matrix of social media channels, and with one sharply worded Tumblr post, shamed Apple <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/22/apple-royalties-u-turn-is-taylor-swift-the-most-powerful-woman-in-music]\">into a U-turn on freezing artist payments during the launch of its new streaming service</a>.</p> \n<p>She‚Äôs perhaps the most influential artist on the planet, then, but also laser-focused on phase two of an already impressive career. Swift‚Äôs migration from Nashville pop-country to New York pop-with-a-capital-P is complete, so this world tour is a tailored victory lap for <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/oct/24/taylor-swift-1989-review\">her fifth album 1989</a>, the launchpad for the irresistible Shake It Off and witty hook-up/breakup ballad <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo\">Blank Space</a>. With a dozen buff dancers and retina-scorching staging, even the minor tracks are punched up into stand-alone blockbusters, though Swift herself remains the most impressive indoor firework. <br /></p> \n<p>She skips through a ballet of doorways on castors during I Know Places, pirouettes in a neon summer dress for How You Get the Girl and even negotiates scaffolding while delivering the throaty battle cries of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo\">Bad Blood</a>. If that suggests a cold, Terminator-style professionalism, the giant screens also capture the occasional goofy grin or eye-roll, a hint that Swift is aware of the ridiculousness of all this art-directed excess, but that won‚Äôt stop her from enjoying it. It‚Äôs a series of knowing winks that invites 12,000 fans to share in the fun.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b7ad3ced2c8a7a1bbda11bbfa1f5f0f4f5724e98\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435235128158/975d7072-84ea-4468-865b-05135aff8ad1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Taylor Swift in Glasgow.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taylor Swift in Glasgow.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross Gilmore/Getty Images for TAS</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Around 75 minutes of music is rolling-pinned out into a 140-minute extravaganza, with pitstops required for costume changes and stage resetting. These lulls are offset by entertaining pre-recorded testimonials from Swift‚Äôs posse of five-star pals, including Lena Dunham, Cara Delevingne and Haim. Even her two cats get a cameo.<br /></p> \n<p>Video inserts aside, Swift emphatically leads from the front. During a series of solo songs, she‚Äôs raised into the centre of the arena bowl on a hydraulic neon seesaw, floating in an impromptu starfield of audience-issued glowing bracelets like some sort of sun god. Swift framed in such an awe-inducing manner while she delivers mini-sermons about the importance of how to deal with heartbreak and be true to yourself gives this gig the air of a pop megachurch. But it also means fans, old and young, get plenty of face time with an enchanting but relatable idol. It‚Äôs a masterclass in inclusivity. <br /></p> \n<ul> \n <li>At <a href=\"http://www.bst-hydepark.com/\">British Summer Time, Hyde Park, London </a>on 27 June. <br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435234830495/a7565e25-269f-443c-96f2-5fb96bcbe075-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ross Gilmore/Getty Images for TAS","altText":"Taylor Swift in Glasgow.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ross Gilmore/Getty Images for TAS"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435235129859/975d7072-84ea-4468-865b-05135aff8ad1-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Taylor Swift in Glasgow.
