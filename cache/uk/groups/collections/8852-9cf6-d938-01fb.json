Current whereabouts unknown</p> \n<p>Gilbert Pidcock’s rhinoceros was an obedient animal with a penchant for sweet red wine. It could guzzle vast quantities (three or four bottles in a sitting). Which may explain how, in October 1792, the rhino stumbled and dislocated its right front leg. “There is…a grave suspicion that it was while laboring under the effects of intoxication that Rhinoceros Indicus came to grief,” wrote one commentator following the accident. </p> \n<p>Some two years earlier, in 1790, the rhinoceros had reached Britain. It was a present from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asaf-ud-Daula\">Asaf-Ud-Daula</a> (the Nawab of the Indian city of Lucknow in Uttar Pradesh) to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Dundas,_1st_Viscount_Melville\">Henry Dundas</a> (President of the Board of Commissioners for the Affairs of India). Rather than “have the trouble of keeping it”, however, Dundas looked to sell. With live rhinos a distinct rarity in 18<sup>th</sup>-century London, the last one (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Claras-Grand-Tour-Rhinoceros-Eighteenth-century/dp/1843541475/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433422376&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=clara+rhinoceros\">Clara</a>) seen in 1758, Dundas obtained &pound;700 for the beast, which eventually came into the possession of Gilbert Pidcock, a menagerist with premises at the Exeter Exchange on the Strand and also a touring menagerie.</p> \n<p>Whenever the young male rhinoceros wanted food, he would cry like a calf. When spectators approached with fruit or other choice tidbits he would cry out in eager anticipation. His diet consisted of clover, biscuits and greens – in addition to the wine. The anatomist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunter_%28surgeon%29\">John Hunter</a> took an interest and commissioned <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Stubbs\">George Stubbs</a> to paint the rhino’s portrait.<em><br /></em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a791e36b9d8a195899262de7f8fc260c325107aa\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433756250026/e8114007-7aaa-43f8-b3f2-f77cbfa0bbce-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"Rhinoceros, 1790\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rhinoceros, 1790, George Stubbs (1724-1806), commissioned by John Hunter, oil on canvas</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal College of Surgeons, London</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Some eight or nine months after the rhinoceros injured its leg, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_of_Mecklenburg-Strelitz\">Queen Charlotte</a> summoned Pidcock to bring the animal to the Queen’s Lodge at Windsor for the princesses to view it. The rhinoceros was drawn on a “machine” – presumably a cumbersome wooden caravan contraption – the “appearance of which highly gratified them and the King”. <br /></p> \n<p>Pidcock went on to show off the rhino at that year’s Ascot Races, before journeying on towards Portsmouth. But around 150km shy of the destination, the animal died from inflammation to its injured leg. By the time the caravan rolled into Portsmouth the body had begun to decompose. The stench was apparently so bad that the city’s mayor ordered that the rhino be buried on Southsea Common. Pidcock complied but was back two weeks later under the cover of darkness to exhume his rhino and preserve its remains.</p> \n<p>This was not a pleasant task: according to the Reverend Thomas Smith in his 1806 work<em> The Naturalist’s Cabinet</em>,<em> </em>“the stench was so insufferable that it was with the most utmost difficulty the persons employed could proceed in their operations.” The odour of rotting rhinoceros was “plainly perceptible” from over half a mile away. Those visitors promenading along the seafront would have found the air particularly bracing or rather, stomach churning. </p> \n<p>With London’s <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartholomew_Fair\">Bartholomew Fair</a> fast approaching, Pidcock was eager to hurry things along. If he couldn’t exhibit a live rhino, a dead one would have to suffice. On the 6 September 1793 at 8pm, nineteen-year-old student Robert Jameson (reading medicine, botany and natural history at Edinburgh University) visited Pidcock’s pitch at the fair in London. The rhino, he noted, “had died a short time before I came to London which loss I much regretted”. He, like other visitors, had to make do with the rhinoceros skin stuffed by the London taxidermist Thomas Hall, and the sight of a live bison and polar bear.</p> \n<p>The now-stuffed rhinoceros returned to the Exeter Exchange on the Strand, where it went on show, eventually joined by another living rhinoceros in 1799. This second “docile and tame” rhinoceros lived for about a year in Pidcock’s menagerie before he sold it to a highly esteemed client; the Holy Roman Emperor Francis II acquired it for &pound;1000. Unfortunately for the Emperor, he never set eyes upon his rhinoceros. It died of breathing problems two months after Pidcock had sold it to him but before it had been shipped to Vienna. The Emperor’s loss was Pidcock’s gain; the menagerist so very narrowly avoided having a second rhinoceros die whilst on his books.</p> \n<p><strong>Tale ends</strong></p> \n<p>Christopher Plumb is a historian and the author of “<a href=\"http://www.ibtauris.com/Books/Humanities/History/Georgian%20Menagerie%20the%20Exotic%20Animals%20in%20EighteenthCentury%20London.aspx?menuitem=%7BF3A45066-008F-41E1-BAE9-603A568CD1AE%7D\">The Georgian Menagerie: Exotic Animals in Eighteenth-Century</a>”, published today by I.B.Tauris.</p> \n<p>After Gilbert Pidcock’s death, the contents of his menagerie were sold at auction on 20 March 1810. The rhino’s skin went for a paltry 5 shillings, suggesting that the 17-year-old preserved skin was in a less-than-perfect condition. The rhino’s horn fetched one pound and two shillings. The whereabouts of the rhinoceros’ skin and horn and their eventual fate are, unfortunately, unknown. Sold as different lots, perhaps they shared very different fates. </p> \n<p>If you know where the remains of Pidcock’s rhino might be please leave a comment or send a message to <a

/></p>","byline":"Ruth Hardy","body":"<p>“At my first graduation I got my boyfriend and best friend to pretend to be my parents,” says doctorate student Lindsay Jordan. “My friend dressed up like Jackie Onassis. It was pretty funny, but I’d rather my real parents had been there.”</p> \n<p>Jordan’s parents didn’t attend either her undergraduate or master’s graduation ceremonies, as “they hate travelling and formal occasions”. While not be for everyone, graduation ceremonies are a chance for parents to celebrate their child’s achievements – and mark the end of university life. But they can also be expensive, stressful and the cause of family arguments. Here’s how to make your student child’s graduation day a happy one.</p> \n<h2>Practical matters</h2> \n<p>If the ceremony is early in the day, you may need to book accommodation; in smaller towns, it can get booked up well in advance of the day. And if you’re travelling by car, be sure to check the parking arrangements before you leave. <br /></p> \n<p>Graduation can get expensive; ticket prices for guests usually cost around &pound;25 each, depending on the university. <br /></p> \n<p>There may also be a limit on the number of guests each student can bring, so if you’re thinking of bringing extended family along with you, check first. For parents of students who have studied abroad, remember that you may have to apply for a visitor visa, and can do so on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration\" rel=\"nofollow\">Home Office website</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2012/oct/16/preparing-for-your-graduation-ceremony-what-to-wear-say-and-do\">Preparing for your graduation: what to wear, say and do</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sarah Brown, administrator of ceremonies at Leeds Trinity University, says you should be aware of other associated costs, too. “Students will normally have to cover the cost of their gown hire or purchase and some institutions may charge for guest ceremony attendance and celebratory receptions,” she says. Many students are fairly cash-strapped at the end of university, so this is something you may choose to help with.</p> \n<h2>The ceremony</h2> \n<p>Formal wear is expected from both students and guests; you’ll have the pictures forever, so it’s worth making an effort with what you wear. But given that most graduations take place in summer, it’s worth checking the weather before you put on a full woollen suit on the hottest day of the year.</p> \n<p>The ceremony itself might be on campus or at a nearby events space. Aim to get there an hour or so early, so your son or daughter has time to collect their robes and mortar board without feeling rushed. </p> \n<p>Graduation ceremonies are notoriously long and can be quite dry, when all that happens for a couple of hours is a list of names are read out. But it’s worth it for the moment your child steps onto the stage. Mark Davies, a former student at Leeds Trinity, says: “Don’t be embarrassed to shout, whoop, whistle and do whatever takes your fancy when your child collects his or her degree certificate. Hearing all those cheers when you make the walk up to receive your degree (while worrying that you’ll fall over!) makes a world of difference.” <br /></p> \n<p>If you plan on going for a lunch or dinner after the ceremony, it’s worth booking in advance, as lots of families will have the same idea. Caitlin Knight, communications manager at the University of Exeter’s Cornwall campus, says: “The restaurants tend to be packed on the night of graduation, with everyone out celebrating in their finery. The whole town is awash in the good mood.” </p> \n<h2>How to behave</h2> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2013/aug/09/should-universities-charge-for-graduation\">Should universities charge for graduation?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“My parents were up late, drinking, the night before (not celebrating my 2:1 may I add) and their hangovers on the day were exacerbated by the extreme heat,” says Hugh Thomas, who graduated from the London School of Economics in 2013. This is just one example of how not to behave on graduation day – although Thomas says he is “eternally grateful for [his parents’] bankrolling of my lavish London lifestyle for three years.”</p> \n<p>Above all, just enjoy spending the day with your family. Davies says: “Take a lot of photos and make some memories. My sisters are always saying ‘serious occasions don’t call for serious photos’, so we spent ages trying to get pictures of usjumping around and having a laugh, and I’ll always remember that time.” Graduation day “provides an opportunity for graduates to say thank you to their parents for the help and support which they have given them throughout their studies, something which can sometimes get overlooked”.</p> \n<p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GdnStudents</a> – and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434463399413/9f2d69c3-dc7f-4162-8253-9333d80048de-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Dan Kitwood/Getty Images","altText":"Graduation is a day for celebration, so follow our guide to avoid any stress.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T08:49:46Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T08:55:58Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruth Hardy","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruth-hardy"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Parents of students 16 and over","Students","Education","Higher education","Graduation","Parents and parenting","Family","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"education/parents-of-students-16-and-over","webTitle":"Parents of students 16 and over"},{"id":"education/students","webTitle":"Students"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"education/higher-education","webTitle":"Higher education"},{"id":"education/graduation","webTitle":"Graduation"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/parents-and-parenting","webTitle":"Parents and parenting"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/family","webTitle":"Family"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"education"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruth Hardy","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruth-hardy"}}],"series":{"title":"Guardian Students","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/education/series/guardian-students"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"education"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jun/30/a-parents-guide-to-graduation","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49znp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/education/2015/jun/30/a-parents-guide-to-graduation","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jun/30/a-parents-guide-to-graduation"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434463399413/9f2d69c3-dc7f-4162-8253-9333d80048de-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Graduation is a day for celebration, so follow our guide to avoid any stress.

A man aged 68 in October who wants to top up his pension would pay a lump sum of &pound;827 for each extra &pound;1 of weekly state pension he would like to receive for the rest of his life. So buying an extra &pound;5 a week would cost him &pound;4,135, while the maximum &pound;25 a week top-up would cost &pound;20,675. However, a man aged 65 on that date would have to pay &pound;22,250 (or &pound;21,775 at age 66). Being slightly younger, he would have to pay slightly more because his life expectancy is greater – which means the state will typically have to pay out the extra pension for a longer period.</p> \n<p>This <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/state-pension-topup\" rel=\"nofollow\">online calculator</a> can help you decide whether topping up is worth doing.</p> \n<p>Smith-Hughes says the advantage of buying extra state pension is that the additional income you buy will rise in line with the consumer prices index inflation measure; and for married couples or civil partners, surviving partners get 50% of the pension on death.</p> \n<p>However, he warns that those on low incomes should think carefully before buying extra state pension. This is because it will be taken into account when assessing eligibility for means-tested state benefits such as housing benefit, council tax reduction and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/pension-credit/overview\" rel=\"nofollow\">pension credit</a>, which tops up your weekly income if it is below &pound;151.20 (for single people) or &pound;230.85 (for couples).</p> \n<h2><strong>Flat-rate state pension</strong><br /></h2> \n<p>From 6 April 2016, the new so-called flat-rate state pension kicks in, replacing the current basic state pension and state second pension. Its exact value hasn’t been confirmed yet, but it is expected to be at least &pound;151.25 a week, or &pound;7,865 a year.</p> \n<p>Justin Modray at Candid Financial Advice says: “The pension is poorly named, because it gives the impression that everyone will get the same, and they won’t.”</p> \n<p>Once again, how much you get will depend on your NI contributions, and you will now need to have paid them for 35 years to get the full amount.</p> \n<p>Your pension forecast won’t show how much you will get under the new system, but it should at least give you a rough idea, Modray says. “You can use this to decide whether to top your state pension with voluntary NI contributions or work out how much you need to save in other sources, such as a pension or tax-efficient individual savings account (Isa).” </p> \n<h2><strong>Putting off your pension</strong></h2> \n<p>You don’t have to take your state pension as soon as you reach the state retirement age. Instead, you can defer taking the money and in return draw a larger pension when you do finally claim it.</p> \n<p>Andrew Tully, pensions technical director at Retirement Advantage, says this can give your pension a sizeable boost. “If you reach state pension age before 6 April 2016, you will get an extra 1% on your pension for each five weeks you defer.”</p> \n<p>Deferring your pension is worth considering if you plan to carry on working, or have other forms of income to live on. “By deferring for a year, a single person’s pension would rise to &pound;128.01 a week, giving them an extra &pound;627 a year. Alternatively, you can take that money as a lump sum instead, and the government will give you &pound;6,180.”</p> \n<p>You have to set this against the fact that you have missed out on one year of pension at &pound;115.95 a week, worth &pound;6,029.</p> \n<p>Tully says that, once you start claiming: “You would need to live another nine years, eight months, to break even. After that, you are into profit.” The better your health and longer your life expectancy, the greater the potential benefits from pension deferral.</p> \n<p>You don’t get more state second pension by deferring, so think carefully before you do this.</p> \n<p>Deferral will make less sense if you reach state pension age on or after 6 April 2016. In this situation you will have to defer your pension for nine weeks for each 1% of uplift, which to someone who gets the maximum state pension is worth only &pound;456 for each year you delay, Tully says. “You would need to live to 80 to make the sums work.”</p> \n<p>This is a complicated area, but you can get free advice by visiting the <a href=\"http://www.pensionsadvisoryservice.org.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pensions Advisory Service</a> website or calling 0300 123 1047. </p> \n<h2><strong>Retiring overseas</strong></h2> \n<p>You can still claim your state pension if you retire overseas. However, in around 170 countries the amount you receive will be frozen at the point you cease to be resident in the UK.</p> \n<p>If you retire in Canada, South Africa, Australia or New Zealand, or Commonwealth countries such as Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Nigeria, your pension will not be uprated annually, despite a long-running campaign by British expats. <a href=\"http://www.pension100.co.uk/expatpensioners/frozen2007.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">Find out which countries are affected</a>.

Setting aside the many opinions on the subject, you might watch the tourists. When people are visiting a city especially to enjoy it, where do they stay? Until recently they had to stay wherever the hotels already were, so their choices told you little. Now however, with online accommodation sharing, people seem to be choosing to stay where people live – and you can get this kind of data from Airbnb.</p> \n<p>Or you nearly can. Airbnb doesn’t give out guest data very casually, or, at least, it doesn’t to me, but you can learn a lot from its listings. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/feb/27/paris-becomes-airbnbs-top-home-sharing-city-destination\">Paris is the world’s biggest city for Airbnb</a>, with more than 40,000 listings (compared with New York’s 34,000 and London’s 23,000). During last summer alone, 66,320 Airbnb guests stayed just in the Marais, a historic arty district in the centre, according to the <a href=\"http://graphics.wsj.com/how-airbnb-is-taking-over-paris/\">Wall Street Journal</a>. As the newspaper points out, that is slightly more than the Marais’s 64,795 actual residents. One flat in the Marais could easily host several dozen people over the course of a busy summer, so the locals were probably not outnumbered by guests at any given time, but still. The Marais isn’t very big and 66,320 is a lot of people.</p> \n<p>For the UK’s capital, Airbnb provides a list of <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/locations/london\">48 suggested London “neighbourhoods”</a> – a fine word, albeit not one that many Londoners would use. The list does not cover the whole capital, nor is each neighbourhood the same size. And, of course, there’s no way of knowing how many of the listings are busy, and how many have never been used. Even so, you can click on each one to see how many rentals are currently being offered there – and when you do, it is revealing.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8b42748beba994f56cc33777768d09f736f46d9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435595972047/e749c163-b02d-4e40-ac41-ef28dd424e0c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Trendy cafes and restaurants along the towpath of the Regent's Canal, Shoreditch.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hipsters welcome: the towpath of the Regent’s Canal, Shoreditch.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Segre/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For one thing, the very centre of London isn’t where it’s at. Covent Garden (239 listings), Soho (194), the City of London (185) and Westminster (140) are all in the bottom half of the list. Compare that with Walworth (360) and the Isle of Dogs (373), which I doubt many Londoners think of as tourist destinations. In truth, this probably reflects the fact that there are more dwellings outside the centre – and the fact that people who live in the centre are so rich that they don’t need to bother with Airbnb. This is most stark when you look at the figures for Mayfair (113), Belgravia (54) and, most of all, St James’s (23), which sits in splendid isolation at the bottom of the list.</p> \n<p>Kensington (755) and Notting Hill (612) do still fare well as the second and fourth most popular tourist neighbourhoods in London – possibly because they are not only very famous but also have a fair number of flats and houses – but at the very top of the table there is a more revealing clue to as to what is going on. In third place, Whitechapel/Brick Lane (680) and, towering above all others, Shoreditch (909), seem to demonstrate that using Airbnb is, for now at least, still a hipster thing. Maybe in a couple of years we’ll see what foreigners really think.</p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435593691588/f6940758-6783-41d5-8c71-1401cfe9806c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"imageBROKER/REX Shutterstock/imageBROKER/REX Shutterstock","altText":"Le Marais, Paris","cleanCredit":"Photograph: imageBROKER/REX Shutterstock/imageBROKER/REX Shutterstock"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435595973530/e749c163-b02d-4e40-ac41-ef28dd424e0c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hipsters welcome: the towpath of the Regent’s Canal, Shoreditch.

Her time was not only a massive world record, beating her own previous world record of 2:17:18, which she set the previous October in Chicago, but it moved her three minutes and 22 seconds ahead of the next fastest female marathoner in the world, Catherine Ndereba.

At the time, Dave Bedford, the London race director and former 10,000m world champion, called it “the greatest distance-running performance I have seen in my lifetime, it ranks in my mind with the impact of Bob Beamon’s long jump in 1968.” But if anything, Radcliffe’s achievement has swollen since then. In the ensuing 12 years, no other woman has finished a marathon within three minutes of her world record. Radcliffe also continues to hold the three fastest women’s marathon times ever recorded.</p> \n<p> For the past four years, I’ve been considering where the limits of the men’s marathon might lie. <a href=\"http://www.penguin.co.uk/books/two-hours/9780670921898/\">My book, <em>Two Hours</em>,</a> is about the quest to reach one of the last great barriers in athletics: the sub-two-hour marathon. (The world record, held by Dennis Kimetto of Kenya, is 2.02.57.) But, throughout the writing of the book, it occurred to me that we might have already witnessed the equivalent of a sub-two marathon: Radcliffe’s 2003 world record.</p> \n<p>This is not an original thought. Last year, Mike Joyner, a polymath from the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, argued this point with vigour. (Joyner wrote the original 1991 paper on the feasibility of the first sub-two-hour marathon, in which, somewhat famously in academic circles, he posited an “ultimate” time for the men’s marathon of 1:57:58.) Last year’s paper for the Journal of Applied Physiology, co-authored by Joyner, Sandra Hunter and Andrew Jones, contended that the “sex difference” between men and women – the relatability of performance between the genders because of differences in body shape, heart size, lung capacity and so on – could be calculated at around 12% or 13%. Not co-incidentally, that percentage difference was what you got if you looked at the 100 best marathon times for men and women, but excluded Radcliffe’s three fastest times. In other words, the fourth best women’s marathon time would be roughly equivalent to the men’s world record now (2.02.57). The authors argued that the best women’s time – Radcliffe’s – is equivalent to a men’s 1:59.</p> \n<p>How did a woman from Cheshire with a seemingly awkward gait destroy the world record in a sport dominated by East Africans?</p> \n<p>One contentious and frequently cited aspect of her world record performance in London is that she ran the marathon alongside two men. Pacemakers can be important to fast times. For manifold reasons, it’s tiring to front-run alone. Pacers not only shoulder some of the psychological burden of pacing the race, they can physically shield an elite runner from the wind. Men pacing women is an ethical tangle, because male pacers with good personal bests can generally be more flexible than male pacers in men’s races, who must run flat-out. In an effort to untangle the rules, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) later brought in a clause for the women’s world record that it must be run in an “all-women” race, and Radcliffe’s record was rescinded for a period, before being reinstated. </p> \n<p>In my mind, the pacers are a side issue. Almost all of the recent men’s world records have been paced. Haile Gebrselassie was occasionally shielded by a team of pacers, who surrounded him like a gaggle of migrating geese. Why shouldn’t Paula have received the same assistance? In fact, she says has always insisted that she raced the men who accompanied her, rather than using them in a traditional role as pacemakers.</p> \n<p>It’s more interesting to look at how Radcliffe prepared. Her pain threshold was legendary. Gerard Hartmann, Radcliffe’s long-time physiotherapist, who lived with her for weeks at a time during training, told <em>The Guardian</em> in 2013: “I’ve worked with 63 Olympic medallists and there was nobody, from Haile Gebrselassie to Kelly Holmes, who on the treatment table could ever take that level of pain. She would hurt me rather than me hurt her. She would actually break me down because I’d have to go so deep into the sinews, I would have to ice my thumbs afterwards I was in such pain.”</p> \n<p>Radcliffe, however, was no mere pain junkie. She was always working not just to be fitter, but to be better. One of the most instructive statistics about Radcliffe is that she improved her running economy by about 15% over the course of her career. Running economy is the measure of how much energy it takes to power an athlete down the road, and it’s one of the vital facets of one’s success or otherwise in elite distance running. Radcliffe may have looked ungainly, but she conditioned herself to be miserly with her fuel. In automotive terms, her miles-per-gallon ratio was exceptional.</p> \n<p>The most important part of her body, however, was her head. I had a fascinating conversation with Radcliffe two years ago in which I asked her what time she had aimed to run the first half of the London Marathon of 2003. She told me she didn’t know. Her broad aim in marathons was to run a “negative” split – that is, to get faster in the second half. But, beyond that, she never chained herself to a schedule of splits throughout the race.</p> \n<p>“I ran how I felt,” she said. “I had a mantra of ‘no limits’ throughout my career … So I never really ran to try and hit certain times at halfway, or whatever. The big thing was: Why would we set a limit? What if you felt better than that? What are you going to do? Slow down?”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/apr/19/paula-radcliffe-london-marathon-rousing-send-off-final-race\">Paula Radcliffe deserves rousing send-off in 2015 London Marathon</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This idea of ‘no limits’ sounds like common sense. But it is the very opposite of what happens in most marathons. I have sat in the meeting rooms of mid-range business hotels in Europe and America on the day before major races, as the organiser has set out his schedule of how fast the pacemakers will run the first half of a race, the first 30km, the first 35km. Two dozen elite East African runners with astonishing personal bests have nodded along. And, almost invariably, the plan has gone awry on race day – in large part, I always think, because most Kenyans and Ethiopians want to run as Radcliffe ran: on feel, not splits. Indeed, in Boston in 2011, when Geoffrey Mutai and Moses Mosop recorded what were then the two fastest marathons ever (2:03:02 and 2:03:06), Mutai says he had no idea how fast he was running, or what his split times were. He was just trucking. </p> \n<p> Radcliffe’s legacy in the marathon is profound. 2:15:25 may not sound as sexy as 1:59:59, but it is just as earth-shattering a performance. In my view, it will be a decade before her record is broken. The performance has its own wisdom to impart, particularly in the men’s marathon, where the landmark two-hour marathon approaches. If the male elite have taken anything from Radcliffe, they will throw their stopwatches away and tattoo ‘no limits’ above their hearts. </p> \n<p><em>Two Hours: The Quest To Run The Impossible Marathon, by Ed Caesar, is published next month by Viking at &pound;16.99.
