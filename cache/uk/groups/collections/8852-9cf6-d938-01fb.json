They were happy days, though. Playing drums, midnight flits, petty scams, business advisers with unexplained fires, hand to mouth accounting and people getting a bit previous with one another. But I swear I definitely never threatened anyone too much other than as a bit of a joke, and if anyone did get hurt then it was nothing to do with me.</p> \n<p>By the age of 18, I decided to settle down, so with a bit of cash I’d found down the back of a sofa, I bought my first magazine, Home Organist. That was a fucking disappointment, excuse my language, I don’t normally swear I can tell you, but it taught me the first lesson in business. Never trust anyone who is more dishonest than yourself. When I bought it, I was told the title was Home Onanist. They said there was loads of money to be had with photoshoots of women playing Yamahas with one hand and themselves with the other.</p> \n<p>Around this time, I got a phone call from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2010/oct/21/bob-guccione-obituary\">Bob Guccione</a> asking me if I wanted to buy Penthouse. To be honest, I was concerned there wasn’t enough money to be made in soft porn but Bob convinced me I would do OK. Bob and I had our misunderstandings with the Mafia and one of my colleagues came back half-dead from a crazy weekend in New York, but I just wanted to concentrate on the business. To my lasting regret, I couldn’t persuade my gorgeous lady wife, Janet, to do a spread in Readers’ Wives. Even after I offered her &pound;15 and a free ice-cream.</p> \n<p>To be honest, I’ve always resented being referred to as a pornographer. I would far rather be remembered for making a fortune out of the Docklands development and for the deals I did with Conrad Black, Ernest Saunders, Gerald Ronson and Bob Maxwell. No one could have been more surprised than me that they all turned out to be crooks. But I’ve learned to take the rough with the smooth. Some deals you get shafted, other deals you do the shafting. That’s business and as long as you believe in the product, everything will turn out OK. Mind you, it still upsets me no one recognised Asian Babes as a giant leap forward towards a multicultural society. Maybe if more punters had bought the mag, there would be a lot fewer Muslims going off to join Isis and the Daily Express wouldn’t have needed to support Ukip at the last election. Just a thought.</p> \n<p>The turning point in my career came with the death of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/may/07/dave-benett-best-photograph-princess-diana-liza-minnelli\">Princess Diana</a>. While the rest of the country collapsed into mawkish grief, I saw it for what it was. The world’s best publishing opportunity. Within two weeks, I had brought out three special OK! issues of Diana: Her Life in Pictures and made a fucking, excuse my language again, fortune. From then on, I was made and I used the money to buy a few more adult phonelines, a porn TV station and the Daily Express. It was what Diana would have wanted, bless her. Shame she didn’t live a bit longer, really, as she would have been perfect for Forty Plus with the right boobjob.</p> \n<p>I have to tell you I was shocked by the state of the Express when I bought it. “I don’t want a paper that actually tries to report what’s going on in the fucking, sorry, world, you twats,” I yelled quietly, accidentally smashing my fist against the wall, and not locking another half-wit in the cupboard. Not that I ever told my staff what to put in the paper as I’ve always liked to consider myself a hands-off (apart from the odd throat) boss. It was just a coincidence that once a week we ran front page stories about how the Duke of Edinburgh killed Princess Diana and that they decided to splash with the publication of my bestselling autobiography.</p> \n<p>My biggest challenge, though, was buying Channel 5. The question I had to ask myself was: “Could I take the TV station even further down market?” Thanks to programmes like Big Brother and the Woman with Three Vaginas, I was able to do that and cleaned up a cool half billion. Bish bosh. Somewhere over the last few years, it seems my wife Janet divorced me. I can’t think why. Still, easy come, easy go and I am now married to the lovely Joy, an airline stewardess so luscious I could have met her through my premium rate phoneline, Trolley Dollies 4 U. Life is fucking sweet.</p> \n<p><strong>Digested read, digested:</strong> Not

the big event</a></p> \n<p>According to the latest release of Sport England’s annual active people survey, the number of people in England who regularly take part in sport is rising.</p> \n<p>But is has the Olympic promise been kept?

And not just that: from 2008 the number remained fairly stable until a boost in 2012 - no doubt in part thanks to the Olympics. </p> \n<p>However since 2012, the number of people practicing sport for at least 30 minutes at moderate intensity at least once a week has slowly declined. Most recently the number of people participating in sport once a week fell by 222,000 compared with October 2014.</p> \n<h2>Which sports have had the biggest boost or slump since the Olympics? </h2> \n<p>Taking six medals (four of these gold) the Team GB athletics squad did the nation proud at London 2012. Did well-known stars such as Jessica Ennis-Hill and Mo Farah help raise the profile of athletics? It was already one of England’s most loved sports, being the third top sport for weekly participation pre-Olympics but by October 2013-2014, athletics became the second highest. During the year up to March 2015, more than 2.2m people regularly took part in atheltics each week - up by 328,100 on October 2010-October 2011. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/mthly_participation-zip/giv-21277cxjr4LqRtc67/\" data-alt=\"By sport\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/mthly_participation-zip/giv-21277cxjr4LqRtc67/\">By sport</a> \n</figure> \n<p>Close behind on the success stories is cycling. Maybe it’s something to do with the truckload of medals the Team GB cycling team won at London 2012, the promises of investment in cycling infrastructure from the government or the effect of the Tour de Yorkshire, but cycling has done well. The number of people getting on their bike at least once a week reached 2.1m between October 2012-October 2013 (although it has dropped slightly in the most recent data).

No-one’s going to spoil them,’ but when I got there it was amazing.</p> \n<p>“All these other hills have been planted with regimental lines of conifers by the Forestry Commission and it’s the one natural piece of land in the middle of it.”</p> \n<p>Taylor has since got to know Mann, who is still touring with his band, and says the musician would “bite your ear off” if his Welsh hillside was regarded as a publicity stunt.</p> \n<p>“He believed he was making a statement for the environment,” says Taylor. “It’s a great album, a great idea and it was meant very genuinely by Manfred at the time. I’m frequently asked which is my square foot but I haven’t got a clue – we share this piece of countryside which has been preserved.”</p>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/09eba6d932f760a442e4c55e3419da60d9cbd12f/296_0_1704_1023/1704.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1023,"width":1704,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR

Spearheaded by a trio of world No1s in Carlos Moy&aacute;, Juan Carlos Ferrero and Rafael Nadal, the Spanish have reached the final of the venerable team competition seven times since the turn of the century, winning on five occasions. Britain, meanwhile, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2007/jun/03/tennis.features1\">last appeared in the final</a> in 1978, when a team consisting of John and David Lloyd, Buster Mottram and Mark Cox lost 4-1 to the US.</p> \n<p>But a crisis in Spanish tennis means the worm has turned. While the British, led by Andy Murray and ably backed by the resurgent James Ward, will be vying for a first semi-final appearance since 1981 when they play France at Queen’s Club a week on Friday, Spain face an arduous journey to Vladivostok, where they will play Russia.</p> \n<p>Defeat for the Spanish – who last September tumbled out of the World Group as a third-string side slumped to a shock 3-1 loss against Brazil – is unthinkable. While victory would secure a tie against one of this year’s first-round losers, offering a potentially swift return to the competition’s top tier, a further reversal of fortune would condemn Nadal and company to a more extended stay in the relative wilderness of Europe/Africa Zone Group I. A succession of British Davis Cup captains can attest to the difficulty of escaping that sporting straitjacket.</p> \n<p>So where has it all gone wrong for the Spanish? The problems began last September in S&atilde;o Paulo. With Nadal at home recovering from a wrist injury and David Ferrer also absent, Roberto Bautista Agut and Pablo And&uacute;jar occupied the two singles berths against a Brazil team led by Thomaz Bellucci, a useful player but ranked beneath both men. Even without their two star players, Spain should have had more than enough in reserve to clinch the contest. Instead, an inspired Bellucci won both his singles matches and that – combined with a not entirely unexpected win by doubles specialists Marcelo Melo and Bruno Soares – meant Spain were out of the World Group for the first time in 18 years.</p> \n<p>At that point, all hell broke loose. First the popular Moy&aacute; <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/09/18/us-tennis-davis-spain-moya-idUSKBN0HD22920140918\">resigned as Spanish captain</a>, citing the difficulty of persuading the country’s best players to turn out. Then Ferrero – like Moy&aacute; a former world No1 and French Open winner, and a figure who would have been warmly welcomed by the players – was overlooked as his replacement. Instead, the Spanish tennis federation president Jos&eacute; Luis Esca&ntilde;uela appointed Gala Le&oacute;n, the former world No27, as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/29305674\">Spain’s first female Davis Cup captain</a>.</p> \n<p>Fresh from dismissing the furore surrounding his decision to take on Am&eacute;lie Mauresmo as his coach, Murray <a href=\"https://twitter.com/andy_murray/status/513887578723188737\">applauded the news on Twitter</a>. The mood among the Spanish tennis fraternity was darker, however. Toni Nadal, Rafa’s coach and uncle, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/sep/22/gala-leon-garcia-becomes-spain-first-female-davis-cup-captain-tennis\">wondered publicly</a> how a woman with no experience of the men’s tour could function effectively as coach given that she could not enter the locker room. Ferrer said the decision had been made too quickly and without consulting the players. Political opportunism inevitably reared its head, with Spanish parliamentarians wading into a rapidly evolving sexism debate.</p> \n<p>Le&oacute;n inflamed the controversy further when she declared, after what was billed as a conciliatory <a href=\"http://www.marca.com/2014/10/21/tenis/1413893653.html\">meeting with some of the country’s top male players in Valencia</a>: “I’m not going to apologise for being a woman.” That comment drew <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2014/nov/18/rafael-nadal-spain-female-davis-cup-captain\">a strong response from Rafa</a>, who countered: “It seems strange to me, as Davis Cup captain, that instead of seeking union and harmony between players, captains and the federation, she has incited and fed a debate that is totally false and absurd.</p> \n<p>“It seems unfair to me that they have wanted to shift the issue to a place that is evidently a clear issue of populism.”</p> \n<p>Esca&ntilde;uela, meanwhile, the man behind the appointment, came out strongly in support of the beleaguered Le&oacute;n. “I’m the president, and Gala Le&oacute;n is my captain,” he said. “I don’t think any woman has the obligation to explain why she is a woman.”</p> \n<p>Strong words, but before long <em>el presidente</em> would be overtaken by events. Things came to a head on the eve of Wimbledon, when Esca&ntilde;uela was <a href=\"http://spanishnewstoday.com/spanish-tennis-federation-chief-suspended_21691-a.html#.VZkqMZTF-Jd\">suspended by the Tribunal Administrativo del Deporte</a>, the Spanish government’s disciplinary committee for sport, amid questions over the whereabouts of at least €700,000 (&pound;497,000) distributed by the Spanish federation and allegations of a “complete lack of collaboration” with auditors. Nadal bemoaned the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jun/28/rafael-nadal-blasts-spanish-tennis-federation\">“ugly and continuous media show”</a> surrounding Spanish tennis, perhaps suggesting he had taken his eye off the ball well before his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/02/dustin-brown-rafael-nadal-wimbledon\">second-round defeat to Dustin Brown</a>. And Nadal, Ferrer and 42 other Spanish tennis luminaries <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/29/us-tennis-spain-idUSKCN0P90V720150629\">signed an open letter</a> branding the federation’s leadership chaotic and belligerent.</p> \n<p>His position untenable, Esca&ntilde;uela <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/02/tennis-spain-federation-idUKL3N0ZI53S20150702\">stood down as president</a> on Thursday. He was immediately replaced by Fernando Fern&aacute;ndez-Ladreda, a former vice-president of the Spanish federation, who pledged to “restore institutional and sporting normality” as a matter of priority. His first move? To <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/07/03/tennis-spain-coach-sacking-idUKL8N0ZJ3GT20150703\">sack Le&oacute;n</a> after what a statement described as “reflection on the benefits” of her continuing as captain for the Russia tie.</p> \n<p>It is all an ungodly mess, and things are likely to get worse before they get better. With the Russia showdown looming, no one knows who will captain Spain in Vladivostok. Even less clear is who will play. Bautista Agut, who faces Roger Federer on Centre Court on Monday, is the only Spaniard left in the men’s singles at Wimbledon. And in news that will doubtless be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVCXloxMOog\">a dagger through the heart for Judy Murray</a>, Feliciano L&oacute;pez, the world No16, is due to marry the Spanish model Alba Carrillo on the weekend of the tie. <a href=\"http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/video/atp-insider-takeover-feliciano-lopez-mailbag\">Among the invitees</a> are Nadal, Ferrer, Fernando Verdasco and Marc L&oacute;pez.

They aren’t particularly fashionable, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeJODSjIbT8\" title=\"\">Violent Femmes</a> are Furman’s spiritual and material forebears, struggling as they did with society, hormones and God through the medium of ragged country-punk.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDOenFQazrA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDOenFQazrA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Ezra Furman’s Restless Year.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Crucially, though, Furman’s dislocation doesn’t come out as unlistenable angst. It comes out as tunes – roustabout, copper-bottomed, sticky things. From <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDOenFQazrA\" title=\"\">Restless Year</a>, which crystallises Furman’s inability to feel at home anywhere, to One Day I Will Sin No More, the closing track dealing with Furman’s faith, you can hum them all. That’s 13 songs, with 13 nagging hooks and 13 singalong choruses; no mean feat in any genre, let alone a few.</p> \n<p>Last album around, I mistook Furman’s quirky, derivative accessibility for lack of depth. The very title of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahqKl8bbsoE\" title=\"\">I Wanna Destroy Myself</a>, for one, packed in all the cliched rock’n’roll tropes from Iggy and the Stooges to Kurt Cobain. Now, songs such as Restless Year just sound increasingly great, rather than ersatz, and I listen to Furman cook an egg on Haunted Head and well up (“I get a slice of bread/I cut a hole in it/I crack a little an egg into it/Frying pan/And I try to get my mind turned off...”).</p> \n<p>It is easy to get fed up with whining indie balladeers playing at outsider-dom. But <em>Perpetual Motion People</em> confirms Furman as no mere white male navel-gazer, but flammable phosphorus: “If you feel like the tip of a match/Then strike!” goes Tip of a Match. The feel here is reckless, with Furman seeking shelter on Can I Sleep in Your Brain?, or comfort in the staid doo-wop of Pot Holes. As a result, Furman is going to have a new struggle on his hands: with recognition.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435949747627/653d7739-13c3-480b-89b0-abc0cead5b74-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Phil Sharp","altText":"Ezra Furman: 'no mere white male navel-gazer'. \r\n","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Phil Sharp"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T07:59:08Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T07:59:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":18,"contributors":[{"name":"Kitty Empire","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741803/KittyEmpire.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kittyempire"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Indie","Music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/indie","webTitle":"Indie"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kitty Empire","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kittyempire"}}],"starRating":"4","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jul/05/ezra-furman-perpetual-motion-people-review-outsider-not-acquired-taste","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a96p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jul/05/ezra-furman-perpetual-motion-people-review-outsider-not-acquired-taste","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/05/ezra-furman-perpetual-motion-people-review-outsider-not-acquired-taste"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435949747627/653d7739-13c3-480b-89b0-abc0cead5b74-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ezra Furman: ‘no mere white male navel-gazer’.","credit":"Phil Sharp","altText":"Ezra Furman: 'no mere white male navel-gazer'. \r\n","cleanCaption":"Ezra Furman: ‘no mere white male navel-gazer’."}},"importance":3,"kicker":{"title":"Ezra Furman review"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435949747627/653d7739-13c3-480b-89b0-abc0cead5b74-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Phil Sharp","altText":"Ezra Furman: 'no mere white male navel-gazer'. \r\n","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Phil Sharp"}}]}],"lastModified":"2015-07-05T21:26:18Z","personalization":{"id":"uk/groups/collections/8852-9cf6-d938-01fb","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/uk/groups/collections/8852-9cf6-d938-01fb"},"visibility":"all","adTargetingPath":"front"}
