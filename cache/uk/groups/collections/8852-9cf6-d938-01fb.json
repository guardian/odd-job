A question asked by a growing number of parents over the past couple of years, as they noticed their children flocking to the social app. Now its chief executive Evan Spiegel has provided an answer.</p> \n<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=24&amp;v=ykGXIQAHLnA\">surprisingly-grainy video uploaded to Snapchat’s YouTube channel</a>, Spiegel attempts to answer the question “what is Snapchat” with the aid of some old-school pen’n’paper diagrams.</p> \n<p>“Snapchat really has to do with the way photographs have changed. Historically photos have always been used to save really important memories: major life moments,” he said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/16/snapchat-social-network-djs-dillon-francis-alesso\">24-hour party people – why superstar DJs are all over Snapchat</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“But today… pictures are being used for talking. So when you see your children taking a zillion photos of things that you would never take a picture of, it’s cos they’re using photographs to talk… And that’s why people are taking and sending so many pictures on Snapchat every day.”</p> \n<p>Snapchat said in May that <a href=\"http://venturebeat.com/2015/05/26/snapchat-has-100m-daily-users-65-of-whom-upload-photos/\">it had 100 million daily users of its app</a>, with 65% of them using it to share photos and videos. In his video, Spiegel tries to explain to parents how the app has seen a shift from social media sites like Facebook that they are more familiar with.</p> \n<p>“Now the mobile phone has really empowered this idea of instant expression, which is really showing someone where you are and how you’re feeling in the moment,” he said.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“This is important as it relates to identity, because really that’s one of the things that’s at the core of social media. Accumulation was really about this idea that identity is everything I’ve ever done, so you have all the pictures of everything you’ve ever done, and that’s who you are as a person.</p> \n <p>“But instant expression changed that, because instant expression says my identity is who I am right now. It says I’m the result of everything I’ve ever done, but I’m not really the accumulation of all that stuff.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>In the video, Spiegel went on to explain the “three screens of Snapchat” – its camera interface, its list of past conversations, and its screen for watching people’s Snapchat stories – collections of their snaps from a day in chronological order.</p> \n<p>Surprisingly, Spiegel did not talk about Snapchat’s fourth screen, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jan/27/snapchat-discover-video-music-messaging-app\">Discover</a>, which serves up videos and articles from media partners including Vice, Cosmopolitan and CNN, and which launched in January.</p> \n<p>The YouTube video is not the first time Snapchat has tried to talk directly to parents. In February, <a href=\"https://www.snapchat.com/safety\">it launched its “Safety Center” for parents and teachers</a>, outlining its community guidelines and providing advice on how to discuss Snapchat with children.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434520120739/943b57f5-810d-4f22-afd9-eb768b5e73db-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jae C.

Then you have a treat in store. Neither has any experience of ducks but that is water off a duck’s back to this unsinkable duo: “We think we have spotted a gap in the market.” What they haven’t yet spotted is a farmer simple enough to rent them a duck pond. They were professional rugby players and, therefore, prone to serious injury (Rex) and merry japes (Toby). Rex is dull and dependable. Toby, however, is catnip to the ladies. His latest prank is to pour indelible purple sheep dye into Brian’s swimming pool (“It’s designed to stay on a ewe’s bottom in all sorts of weather!”) Apparently, there are even purpler passages in his past. As Rex said: “Toby, get a grip on yourself! You keep on this way and it’ll be like what happened in Brighton all over again.”</p> \n<p>The word Brighton sobered Toby like a bucket of water. You have to ask yourself what could possibly have happened to drive a grown man to duck farming? If you can think of anything capable of shocking Brighton,&nbsp;do tell.</p> \n<p>If you can’t place the Fairbrothers, they are step-nephews of Grace, who took one for the team by dashing into a burning stable the night ITV was launched. Twenty-million people tuned in. Feel free to whistle.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, Mike, the one-eyed milkman, is clearing out his garden shed. He is being dragged to Birmingham by his lively wife like a donkey stuck in melting tar. His whole life is in his shed, that repository of disappointed dreams.

I feel privileged to have worked as a GP for more than 20 years. We look after our patients from cradle to grave with all the joys and challenges this brings and we continue to maintain a high level of public trust. So how did this situation arise? <br /></p> \n<p>After we failed to recruit a replacement for retiring partners at the practice, just two part-time GPs were left with only the support of short-term locum doctors. We worked with the commissioners of primary care (<a href=\"http://www.england.nhs.uk/\">NHS England</a>) as well as the local medical committee (LMC) and our neighbouring practices to try to find a solution. However, we couldn’t find permanent doctors. After nine months of working 14-hour days, and realising we couldn’t continue to care for our patients safely, we made the difficult decision to resign. </p> \n<p>This forced NHS England to look for expressions of interest in the practice, and eight months ago we were taken over by a large practice from the other side of the city. I have remained as a salaried doctor at the surgery continuing to care for my patients, and the remaining staff have transferred over and we are now supported by a larger organisation.</p> \n<p>So <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/350/bmj.h940\">what made my practice vulnerable</a>? First, we were a small practice with two full-time partners close to retirement age. In addition, our funding was less than most other practices, making it more difficult to recruit doctors. Practices receive different funding based on historical agreements – inevitably, lower-funded practices find it harder to survive as pressure on primary care increases. Despite these issues, we had managed to continue providing a high-quality service for our patients, who remained fiercely supportive throughout.</p> \n<p>The NHS still offers one of the best primary health care services in the world. As well as providing quality care for patients, it is efficient, with 90% of consultations taking place in general practice for less than 9% of the total NHS budget. However, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/mar/08/life-of-a-gp-we-are-crumbling-under-the-pressures-of-workload\">system is under significant strain</a> as a result of this chronic lack of funding in the face of the increasing workload associated with an ageing population and the shift of care from hospital to community. Significant numbers of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/society/2015/apr/15/nhs-stress-third-gps-plan-retire-five-years\">GPs are taking early retirement</a> and there is difficulty recruiting young doctors to replace them. A perfect storm of escalating workload, under-funding and recruitment problems is resulting in a crisis in general practice.</p> \n<p>There is a positive new deal for primary care as part of a national five-year plan, which includes increased funding and measures to try to attract doctors into general practice training as well as retain those nearing retirement or following a career break. However, workforce plans are slow to deliver and the current crisis needs immediate action as my own story, and those of many other struggling practices, illustrate.</p> \n<p>For GPs to face the current challenges around workload and recruitment, we urgently need the planned increase in overall funding. In addition, the current variation in funding between practices must be addressed. GPs also need to develop new ways of working with other healthcare professionals while maintaining the continuity of care so valued by patients. This will create a more flexible workforce that can continue to meet the evolving needs of our patients. Increasingly, information technology will also be used to create new options for consulting and communicating with our patients and other professionals, further improving access to primary care. </p> \n<p>General practice is the jewel in the crown of the NHS. It is currently facing unprecedented pressures. But with improved funding and new ways of collaborative and flexible working, there can be a positive future for UK general practice and the next generation of doctors entering it.</p>","section":"Healthcare Professionals Network","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434455032874/a-royal-crown-w-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"/Alamy","altText":"a royal crown","cleanCredit":"Photograph: /Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T06:45:01Z","lastModified":"2015-06-17T06:48:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Healthcare Network","GPs and primary care","Work practices","Workforce","GPs","Doctors","Health","NHS","Society"],"tags":[{"id":"healthcare-network/healthcare-network","webTitle":"Healthcare Network"},{"id":"healthcare-network/gps-and-primary-care","webTitle":"GPs and primary care"},{"id":"healthcare-network/work-practices","webTitle":"Work practices"},{"id":"healthcare-network/workforce","webTitle":"Workforce"},{"id":"society/gps","webTitle":"GPs"},{"id":"society/doctors","webTitle":"Doctors"},{"id":"society/health","webTitle":"Health"},{"id":"society/nhs","webTitle":"NHS"},{"id":"society/society","webTitle":"Society"}],"section":{"id":"healthcare-network"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"healthcare-network"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/healthcare-network/2015/jun/17/small-local-spelt-end-gp-surgery","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49zmp","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/healthcare-network/2015/jun/17/small-local-spelt-end-gp-surgery","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2015/jun/17/small-local-spelt-end-gp-surgery"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434455032874/a-royal-crown-w-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"General practice is the jewel in the crown of the NHS and can have a positive future.

Director Owen Horsley may have compressed the story into 90 minutes but this wasn’t the Henrys-lite. The language was all Shakespeare’s; the themes, humour and emotional undercurrents survived intact and the acting was excellent. Just at a more manageable length for the under-11s.</p> \n<p>I reckon that no child is too young to get a taste of Shakespeare. The earlier the better, because as with quadratic equations and algebra, too often a fear factor sets in with Shakespeare alongside an idea that it’s going to be difficult to understand and boring. Definitely before children have been exposed to the misguided idea that Shakespeare is primarily there to be studied to pass exams rather than to entertain.</p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture-professionals-network/culture-professionals-blog/2012/dec/18/oily-cart-guardian-christmas-appeal\">Oily Cart</a> once produced a show called <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2013/jan/16/in-a-pickle-review\">In a Pickle</a>, inspired by The Winter’s Tale for the under fives, and it was very lovely. No, it wasn’t Shakespeare’s The Winter’s Tale, but it was a prompt for a lifelong journey exploring the plays. Both my kids were lucky enough to benefit from the Globe family performances, a workshop and activities followed by the chance to see the second half of one of the productions in the season. It’s a reminder that when it comes to seeing Shakespeare a bit of pre-performance preparation doesn’t go amiss. My youngest rated seeing Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/2002/apr/01/theatre.artsfeatures\">Twelfth Night</a> right up there with The Lion King, which is of course a version of Hamlet.</p> \n<p>But <a href=\"http://www.whatsonstage.com/stratford-upon-avon-theatre/reviews/famous-victories-henry-v-rsc-tour_38034.html\">as Michael Coveney pointed out</a> in his review of the RSC’s Famous Victories, Helen Mirren would not approve of such early exposure to Shakespeare. A couple of months ago Helen Mirren, no mean performer of Shakespeare herself, suggested that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/william-shakespeare/10784084/Dame-Helen-Mirren-says-children-under-15-should-be-banned-from-reading-Shakespeare.html\">children should first see a Shakespeare play at the age of 13</a> or 14 and should be banned from reading Shakespeare until they are 15 or so.</p> \n<p>I can see where’s she’s coming from – there is nothing so alluring to teenagers as something they are not supposed to access, and brings to mind the image of pages of Romeo and Juliet and King Lear being sold illegally on street corners. But I reckon that just as learning a language comes easier the earlier you begin, so Shakespeare is best encountered young when you are without prejudice. The RSC’s First Encounters initiative reminds that Shakespeare shouldn’t be a struggle for children but a genuine pleasure.</p>","section":"Stage","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434474447205/33e1a1f2-47d6-460e-809e-9d570b5a3934-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Richard Lakos","altText":"The Famous Victories of Henry V: the RSC works with schoolchildren on a stripped-down version of Shakespeare's histories.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Richard Lakos"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T22:03:34Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T22:18:39Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":25,"contributors":[{"name":"Lyn Gardner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/lyngardner"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Theatre","William Shakespeare","Drama and dance","Stage","Culture","Royal Shakespeare Company","Education"],"tags":[{"id":"stage/theatre","webTitle":"Theatre"},{"id":"culture/shakespeare","webTitle":"William Shakespeare"},{"id":"education/dramaanddance","webTitle":"Drama and dance"},{"id":"stage/stage","webTitle":"Stage"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"stage/rsc","webTitle":"Royal Shakespeare Company"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"}],"section":{"id":"stage"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Lyn Gardner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/lyngardner"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"stage"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/stage/theatreblog/2015/jun/16/why-its-best-to-experience-shakespeare-in-your-salad-days","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49p59","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/stage/theatreblog/2015/jun/16/why-its-best-to-experience-shakespeare-in-your-salad-days","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2015/jun/16/why-its-best-to-experience-shakespeare-in-your-salad-days"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434474447205/33e1a1f2-47d6-460e-809e-9d570b5a3934-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Famous Victories of Henry V: the RSC works with schoolchildren on a stripped-down version of Shakespeare’s histories.

But there are some big questions that are hard for the researchers to answer, such as whether it is the chocolate that is protecting people from heart attacks and strokes or other factors such as age and level of exercise. </p> \n<p>The study was based on questionnaires filled out by 21,000 adults in Norfolk in the 1990s, who were asked how many chocolate squares, bars or hot chocolates they consumed each day. The respondents were followed up for 12 years to see whether they developed any heart complaints, while the researchers also undertook a review of other major studies looking at the links between heart health and chocolate.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2014/oct/27/chocolate-component-reverses-memory-loss-older-people-claims-study\">Chocolate component reverses memory loss in older people, claims study</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>One in five of those questioned said they never ate chocolate. Those who did admitted to between 7g and 100g a day. The chocolate eaters tended to be younger and had a lower BMI than those who said they did not touch it. They had lower blood pressure, fewer instances of diabetes, did more exercise and confessed to eating more calories in a diet with more fat and carbohydrates and less protein and alcohol than the rest. Compared to those who said they ate no chocolate, they had an 11% lower risk of cardiovascular disease and 25% lower risk of premature death.</p> \n<p>Milk chocolate appeared to be just as good as dark chocolate, said the researchers, who pondered whether the calcium in the milk may be beneficial as well as the flavonoids in the chocolate. </p> \n<p>But they admit the findings may have to be taken with a pinch of salt. For example, it is possible that those who are eating least chocolate are those who are being careful because they already know they have a heart problem. </p> \n<p>The take-home message is probably just that most chocolate eaters have little to worry about – and not that we should all go out and buy multipacks. Dr Tim Chico, a consultant cardiologist in Sheffield, said: “The message I take from this study is that if you are a healthy weight, then eating chocolate (in moderation) does not detectably increase risk of heart disease and may even have some benefit.

Just another day at the office, then. My crime that day was to have said during an episode of <em>MasterChef</em> that a dessert “looked like the sort of thing served at a cheap wedding full of regret held at a hotel on a ring road”. My correspondent’s stepdaughter had apparently just got married at a ring road hotel and it had been lovely. “I’m sure it was,” I replied, “but was it also full of regret? Because if it wasn’t, it isn’t covered by my critique.” I may be a snob, but I’m a precise snob.</p> \n<p>The touchiness shouldn’t have surprised me. When it comes to food at weddings people are like that. A wedding is one of life’s great set piece events, upon which the compass flickers. Accordingly everything about them must be perfect, even when everything plainly isn’t. And now it’s June, and wedding season is upon us. For the next few months many of us will be putting on suits and frocks smelling of dry cleaning fluid, and tramping into baggy marquees where we will eat some of the worst, most overpriced food ever inflicted upon us by people who claim to be our dearest friends. And then, regardless of how dismal it all was, we will loudly proclaim the opposite. In the coming months more lies will be told about the quality of lunch and dinner than in the rest of the year put together.</p> \n<p>We are meant to be experiencing a British food revolution, and in many ways we are. There are better restaurants than ever before. But in the business of mass catering we are generally awful. I say generally. Obviously, if you run a catering firm and you’re limbering up to complain, I don’t mean you. You’re brilliant. Likewise, the food at your wedding was obviously fabulous. It’s everyone else.</p> \n<p>Everyone else is responsible for dry canap&eacute;s that taste only of margarine and complacency. Everyone else is responsible for desiccated lumps of yesterday’s pre-cooked chicken the colour of an old stained sink; for sauces that could creosote fences and vegetables so overboiled you could suck them through a straw; for cream desserts that have split, and overbaked tarts with pastry like walnut shells. And the cost! I only use exclamation marks for shouting, which is what I’m doing. THE COST! Despite economies of scale, caterers charge more for this dismal crud than the price of a quality restaurant meal and rising. Why are they allowed to get away with it?</p> \n<p>Precisely because it’s a special event, and nobody likes to admit one of those isn’t actually that special. Plus, avoiding the pitfalls of mass catering dreariness requires a certain radicalism: the willingness to do away with the awful formally plated main course, to sack the poor exploited teenage waitresses and instead concentrate spend on the cooking. The problem is that weddings generally involve young people and for all their youthful irreverence, young people can be rather “small c” conservative. A wedding is a grown-up event, and they have a mythologised notion of what grown-up looks like, which includes a marquee and chicken the colour of a stained sink.</p> \n<p>Recently the savings expert Martin Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/cheaper-weddings\">website </a>said that, when booking a wedding reception at a hotel, tell them it’s for a party rather than for nuptials. Apparently hotels charge more the moment they hear it’s a wedding. This is good advice.
