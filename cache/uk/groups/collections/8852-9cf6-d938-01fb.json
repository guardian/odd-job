Do you like them sweet or salty, spiced, fruity or plain, and what is the best type of yoghurt to use?</p>","byline":"Felicity Cloake","body":"<p>This cooling yoghurt drink, popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, has a number of things to recommend it. First, it is utterly delicious, as anyone who has thrown caution and official advice about only drinking sealed bottles of water to the wind will testify – creamy and sweet-sour, sometimes salty, sometimes subtly spiced and never less than utterly refreshing. Second, it falls into that happy category of desserts masquerading as drinks, which means it is quite acceptable to put one away while you’re waiting for your food to arrive, then demolish another one immediately afterwards, even as you wave away suggestions of pudding.</p> \n<p>Lassi comes in two distinct varieties: sweet and salty (also known as chaas). The sweet version is often simply flavoured with sugar, which balances the natural sourness of the yoghurt, but can also be jazzed up with rose water, saffron or pureed fruit. As chef Cyrus Todiwala explains, “In summer, when the heat is intense, many Indians enjoy a good lassi instead of a meal.” The mango sort is one of my favourites, ripe mangoes being inextricably linked in my mind with India, but the recipe below is versatile enough to work with most fruits, or no fruit at all. This does not mean I endorse any sort of salted caramel or goji berry versions. Some things should remain sacred.</p> \n<h2>The dairy</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8ed25b95c616c4916991029b67d1cf8cb0b14ddb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432142248700/bce7e690-583e-4f6a-b3e0-40fccfd6fd08-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Anjali Pathak's lassi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anjali Pathak’s lassi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is what makes or breaks your lassi, and there is a surprising amount of variation among recipes. Though it is always made with yoghurt, Monir Mohammed and Martin Gray’s book Mother India at Home, based on recipes from the former’s Glasgow restaurant, <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4qqCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT166&amp;lpg=PT166&amp;dq=%22mother+india%22+%22mango+lassi%22+buttermilk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m9FnKuWz2Z&amp;sig=NoPn0s3tskb55ni6Vsf77XgnWM0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1z5LVZqxC8zsUtGKgIAL&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22mother%20india%22%20%22mango%20lassi%22%20buttermilk&amp;f=false\">has one which is equal parts buttermilk and milk</a>, with just a couple of spoonfuls of yoghurt. The India and Pakistan volume of Charmaine Solomon’s Complete Asian Cookbook supplies a recipe that is mostly soda water.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2015/apr/09/how-to-cook-perfect-chicken-korma-curry-recipe\">How to cook the perfect chicken korma</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By contrast, <a href=\"http://meerasodha.com/avocado-and-honey-lassi-with-cinnamon/\">Meera Sodha’s Made in India</a> and Mr Todiwala’s Bombay use yoghurt alone, with Sodha suggesting Greek yoghurt for those of us too lazy to make our own (ie me). Vivek Singh, <a href=\"http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/5496-mango-lassi_\">Madhur Jaffrey</a> and <a href=\"http://anjalipathak.com/2014/07/sweet-lassi/\">Anjali Pathak</a> all thin their yoghurt with water, with the last claiming in her book Secrets from My Indian Family Kitchen that you can use low-fat yoghurt if you prefer, a suggestion which I treat with the scepticism it deserves. Though even the yoghurt-only versions are slightly diluted with ice, I find the Greek variety too thick to drink, while Pathak’s almost equal parts yoghurt and water recipe proves too thin for my taste (and the combination of fizzy soda water and creamy yoghurt is just plain weird).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a236e882d785f13fcd9a52f6bd8e86fce61912f1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432142409333/ef1a36fa-a941-4e32-ab05-b4ba59c9ef7c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cyrus Todiwala's lassi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cyrus Todiwala’s lassi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I like the consistency of the buttermilk and milk recipe and Todiwala’s plain yoghurt and ice one, both of which are richly creamy, as a good lassi ought to be, yet just thin enough to slide down the throat in a pleasingly cooling fashion. The yoghurt version is slightly thicker and the flavour creamier, which swings it in the end, though Mother India’s one is worth bearing in mind if you have buttermilk to use up – after making scones, for example.</p> \n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2010/04/why-are-indian-yogurt-drinks-divine/38731/\">Mr Chatwani of the Jay Kishan Lassi House in Nadiad</a>, Gujarat, the creamier the yoghurt, the better: “After all, no self-respecting lassi-maker wants to be caught adding water and making it thinner!”. I’ll be using a chilled whole-milk yoghurt, whizzed up with a little ice to cool it down and thin it to a drinkable consistency. If you’d prefer a plain sweet version, which won’t benefit from the water in the fruit, add a little cold water or milk too, as Singh suggests in his sweet lassi recipe.</p> \n<h2>The fruit</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0816549593602c6702a4424f88ddcffbbe676dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432142307591/7ffb59aa-42c1-4e27-aff9-fb266519a3d7-1020x1020.jpeg\" alt=\"Meera Sodha's lassi.\" width=\"1020\" height=\"1020\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meera Sodha’s lassi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Purchases this week have confirmed my worst suspicions about the mangoes available in this country; as Sodha laments: “The season for alphonso mangoes is short, and our supermarkets prefer selling unripe Brazilian mangoes as they have longer seasons and are hardier.” Happily, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/alphonso-mangoes-eu-lifts-ban-on-indian-mango-imports-9990412.html\">the EU has lifted its ban on the super-sweet alphonso</a>, which has just come into season, so if you can find it (and you’ll need a good greengrocer, market or Indian specialist grocers), gorge yourself. Otherwise, you’ll need to buy those big, thick-skinned varieties and ripen them at home until they’re really sweet and squishy, or find a tin of mango pulp, as Jaffrey suggests. It doesn’t have quite the same fresh acidity as the fruit itself, but it is really not a bad alternative (and tends to be much cheaper, too). Look for it in the Indian section of large supermarkets.</p> \n<h2>The sugar and flavourings</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"64c80552ca86f286c500e8f74600fa4e487b89b6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432142356214/3b77ebcd-065d-4449-a4f7-47bf494d418b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Charmaine Solomon's lassi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Charmaine Solomon’s lassi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Not all the recipes I try add sugar and, of course, it depends on the flavour of the fruit you use. I prefer those, such as Mother India and Todiwala, that use quite a high proportion of fruit to dairy, which should mean there is no need to sweeten it any further, though do so to taste. Chatwani uses brown sugar, which I rather like. Todiwala says: “You may like to sharpen your lassi with a squeeze of lime juice.” I find the tang of the yoghurt I use quite sufficient, but if you don’t share the famous Indian sweet tooth, bear this in mind.</p> \n<p>I do, however, like the ground cardamom that Sodha and Jaffrey use as a flavouring – it goes wonderfully with the mango, and far better than Pathak’s suggested alternative, cinnamon. Singh’s rose water is nice in his plain lassi, and would work well with red fruits, but the predominant flavours here should be sweet mango and creamy dairy.</p> \n<p>Green smoothies are so 2014: this is the summer of the lassi.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdc761a5a2332d21acb662ae7fcce43c3d6c9cb4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432142481681/ba5d3c04-d3bf-44ef-b088-1063b82ab988-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mother India's lassi\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mother India’s lassi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The perfect mango lassi</strong></h2> \n<p><strong><em>(Makes 1)</em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>1 very ripe alphonso or honey mango, or about 200g very ripe supermarket mango or mango pulp</strong></p> \n<p><strong>5 ice cubes</strong></p> \n<p><strong>125ml chilled plain whole milk yoghurt</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Pinch of ground cardamom, or to taste</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Splash of milk or water (optional)</strong></p> \n<p>&frac12;<strong> tsp soft light brown sugar (optional)</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Squeeze of lime juice (optional)</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5aaa0bfcadfaeca5c8cb282239544909f097ba35\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432142566947/e2b9b069-db03-4997-a6e1-041fc8934653-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"Perfect mango lassi.\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Perfect mango lassi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>To peel the mango, cut away the fatter sides from the stone, then cut cross-hatches in the flesh, turn inside out so the cubes stick out, and scoop into a blender with a sharp teaspoon.

Well, because the show is recorded earlier in the day we’ve actually got a pretty good idea of who is going to turn up. Plenty of people were camped outside the Ed Sullivan Theatre to spot guests and celebrities, and here is the list of everyone who was seen making their way in or out:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Steve Martin</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Chris Rock</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Jerry Seinfeld </strong></p> \n <p><strong>Tina Fey </strong></p> \n <p><strong>Barbara Walters</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Jim Carrey</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Peyton Manning</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Alec Baldwin</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Bill Murray</strong></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>They add up to ten former Letterman guests and pals who are rumoured to be taking part in a final “Top ten list” where the celebs state the “final thing they would like to say to David Letterman”. Kudos to Bill Murray for turning up two nights in a row.

Craig Ferguson <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2014/dec/20/craig-ferguson-last-late-show\">left his position as host of the Late Late Show</a>, where he was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/feb/22/james-corden-us-move-talkshow-cbs\">replaced by James Corden</a>. Jon Stewart said he was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/apr/18/jon-stewart-why-i-quit-the-daily-show\">stepping down from the Daily Show</a> in August, when he will be replaced by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2015/mar/31/trevor-noah-backlash-highlights-jokes-jews-women\">South African comic Trevor Noah</a>. Elsewhere, the two Jimmys (Fallon and Kimmel) continue to dominate on either coast, while Conan is still the late-night outsider on TBS.</p> \n<div>\n  __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456770722__ \n</div> \n<p>Letterman’s departure, however is by far the most significant due to his influence on not only CBS’s late-night output, but all of the current breed of late-night hosts. Of course, he wasn’t always the biggest deal in late night (arguably he isn’t at the moment as Fallon has much better ratings), and his <em>b&ecirc;te noire</em> was Jay Leno – another possible guest tonight, although no one has seen him so far.</p> \n<p>The two vied for Johnny Carson’s slot on NBC’s the Tonight Show – Leno prevailed after a protracted battle – and Letterman took a role at CBS after being courted by most of the networks. Bill Carter followed the story and wrote The Late Shift, which was eventually turned into a show on HBO. He wrote <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/may/15/david-letterman-late-night-prankster-comedy-godfather\">for us last week</a>:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“Starting as the puckish, peckish, insistently amusing kid brother; he became the commanding comedy perfectionist, before evolving into a cranky curmudgeon over the past decade or so: an on-camera version of the irascible neighbor spraying the garden hose to keep the kids off his lawn. Letterman has lived out a career – and life – in an electronic display window, one that faced directly into American bedrooms.</p> \n <p>A man of complex temperament, daringly forthright on camera, insecure and reclusive off, Letterman has been a show business original since his first day as talkshow host – on an NBC daytime program in 1980 – the leader of a new generation of American comics, intent on parodying the entertainment world even as they lived in it, and off it.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So this is the end of an era, not only for Letterman but for his brand of late night host. Fallon and co have flourished by creating content that works online rather than only on television after 11 o’clock. Before the torch is passed a load of celebs came out to show their love for Dave and wrote funny little jokes on cue cards and then posed for pictures with them. </p> \n<p>Here are a few:</p> \n<h2>John Travolta</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Travolta\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

We joined in the hoards who wrote pieces about his musical influence. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/20/david-letterman-best-musical-guests\">Maura Johnston ran through</a> some of his best musical guests, including the Beastie Boys’ performance in 2004:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ2ZHkBzmHQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZ2ZHkBzmHQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“The iconic New York hip-hop trio first appeared on Letterman’s show in 1992, and their raunchy reputation back then inspired Dave to pronounce during his monologue that he didn’t “want no trouble, OK?” (Apparently a few years prior, despite not appearing on the show, their presence in 30 Rockefeller Center had included their “terrorizing Sue Simmons”, then anchor of the local news show Live at Five.) Twelve years later, all grown up, they showed the Late Show audience how even though they were older and wiser they still owned the five boroughs’ streets; their performance of the 2004 track Ch-Check It Out opened in a subway entrance and wound its way to the Ed Sullivan Theater, with Letterman greeting them like old friends once they eventually made their way to his desk.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Other versions of Dave that people spoke/wrote about included Sad Dave, with Alan Sepinwall giving his saddest moments of Letterman’s reign:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/wayne-cabot/letterman-sepinwall\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F206430158&amp;show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Hollywood Reporter’s tv critic Tim Goodman (AKA Bastard Machine) also gave his <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/david-letterman-legacy-saying-goodbye-796996\">slightly emotional thoughts</a> about Dave’s departure:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I’ve watched these Letterman farewell episodes and done plenty of tearing up in the process. And I’ve marveled not only at his legacy and endurance and influence (all the obvious things we talk about when someone like Letterman retires), but also simply how much people really do love him and will miss him.</p> \n <p> If you’ve lived long enough and watched enough television you’ve seen plenty of farewells. If there’s anything notable about the departure of a true ground breaker, it’s the legitimate appreciation on hand. You can’t fake some of the tears and the looks these celebrity guests and friends have given him.

Indeed, most have either cried off out of “respect” for Dave or have dedicated huge segments of their shows to him.</p> \n<h2>Conan O’Brien</h2> \n<p>Conan when for the latter when he recalled the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/conan-obrien-honors-david-letterman-797301\">support Letterman gave him</a> after he took over his slot on NBC in 1993 and was hammered by the critics:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p> “I got the shit kicked out of me. Critics despised me, the ratings were bad, my skin broke out, and my network started to make it clear that I probably wouldn’t be around very long. I honestly have no ill will about that time because, by and large, people were right. I was in way over my head - and with this hair, that’s saying something - and the conventional wisdom was that I should be immediately cancelled.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p> He added that at his personal low point Letterman offered support:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p> “At one of the lowest points of my life, when I was a 30 year old national punchline, Dave, for reasons I still don’t really understand ---- completely rescued me. I truly believe that simple act of kindness turned everything around and made all the difference.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV7NC0DGgVg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tV7NC0DGgVg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2> Jimmy Kimmel</h2> \n<p> Jimmy Kimmel went for the former, deciding against recording a new show and instead going for a rerun. He told the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-wont-air-new-794036\">Hollywood Reporter</a>: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I have too much respect for Dave to do anything that would distract viewers from watching his final show. Plus, I’ll probably be crying all day, which makes it hard to work.” </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Sounds like the worst excuse not to turn up to work ever.</p> \n<h2>Jimmy Fallon</h2> \n<p>Fallon isn’t having any of that nonsense. He’s got a full slate of guests including David Duchovny and, er, Pitbull AKA Mr Worldwide. It’s definitely the b-side but, gives me the opportunity to remind everyone about this brilliant sketch by Limmy that tackles the genuinely baffling ubiquity of Pitbull:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHGN7Q7fKlA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHGN7Q7fKlA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>Jon Stewart</h2> \n<p>The US’s premier political satirist is also taking the night off. He’s got a rerun of his Kristen Wiig episode, which if her appearance at the Grammys is anything to go by might be worth flicking over to every now and then.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7rFkpcyZ598\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/7rFkpcyZ598?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Right, on with the show. </p>","postType":"key-event"},{"id":"block-555d5250e4b0c086d6b71417","publishedDateTime":"2015-05-21T03:35:13Z","body":"<p>Ok, we are minutes away now.

Well, because the show is recorded earlier in the day we’ve actually got a pretty good idea of who is going to turn up. Plenty of people were camped outside the Ed Sullivan Theatre to spot guests and celebrities, and here is the list of everyone who was seen making their way in or out:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p><strong>Steve Martin</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Chris Rock</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Jerry Seinfeld </strong></p> \n <p><strong>Tina Fey </strong></p> \n <p><strong>Barbara Walters</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Jim Carrey</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Peyton Manning</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Alec Baldwin</strong></p> \n <p><strong>Bill Murray</strong></p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>They add up to ten former Letterman guests and pals who are rumoured to be taking part in a final “Top ten list” where the celebs state the “final thing they would like to say to David Letterman”. Kudos to Bill Murray for turning up two nights in a row.

Craig Ferguson <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2014/dec/20/craig-ferguson-last-late-show\">left his position as host of the Late Late Show</a>, where he was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/feb/22/james-corden-us-move-talkshow-cbs\">replaced by James Corden</a>. Jon Stewart said he was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/apr/18/jon-stewart-why-i-quit-the-daily-show\">stepping down from the Daily Show</a> in August, when he will be replaced by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2015/mar/31/trevor-noah-backlash-highlights-jokes-jews-women\">South African comic Trevor Noah</a>. Elsewhere, the two Jimmys (Fallon and Kimmel) continue to dominate on either coast, while Conan is still the late-night outsider on TBS.</p> \n<div>\n  __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456770722__ \n</div> \n<p>Letterman’s departure, however is by far the most significant due to his influence on not only CBS’s late-night output, but all of the current breed of late-night hosts. Of course, he wasn’t always the biggest deal in late night (arguably he isn’t at the moment as Fallon has much better ratings), and his <em>b&ecirc;te noire</em> was Jay Leno – another possible guest tonight, although no one has seen him so far.</p> \n<p>The two vied for Johnny Carson’s slot on NBC’s the Tonight Show – Leno prevailed after a protracted battle – and Letterman took a role at CBS after being courted by most of the networks. Bill Carter followed the story and wrote The Late Shift, which was eventually turned into a show on HBO. He wrote <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/may/15/david-letterman-late-night-prankster-comedy-godfather\">for us last week</a>:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“Starting as the puckish, peckish, insistently amusing kid brother; he became the commanding comedy perfectionist, before evolving into a cranky curmudgeon over the past decade or so: an on-camera version of the irascible neighbor spraying the garden hose to keep the kids off his lawn. Letterman has lived out a career – and life – in an electronic display window, one that faced directly into American bedrooms.</p> \n <p>A man of complex temperament, daringly forthright on camera, insecure and reclusive off, Letterman has been a show business original since his first day as talkshow host – on an NBC daytime program in 1980 – the leader of a new generation of American comics, intent on parodying the entertainment world even as they lived in it, and off it.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>So this is the end of an era, not only for Letterman but for his brand of late night host. Fallon and co have flourished by creating content that works online rather than only on television after 11 o’clock. Before the torch is passed a load of celebs came out to show their love for Dave and wrote funny little jokes on cue cards and then posed for pictures with them. </p> \n<p>Here are a few:</p> \n<h2>John Travolta</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Travolta\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot;

We joined in the hoards who wrote pieces about his musical influence. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/20/david-letterman-best-musical-guests\">Maura Johnston ran through</a> some of his best musical guests, including the Beastie Boys’ performance in 2004:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZ2ZHkBzmHQ\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GZ2ZHkBzmHQ?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“The iconic New York hip-hop trio first appeared on Letterman’s show in 1992, and their raunchy reputation back then inspired Dave to pronounce during his monologue that he didn’t “want no trouble, OK?” (Apparently a few years prior, despite not appearing on the show, their presence in 30 Rockefeller Center had included their “terrorizing Sue Simmons”, then anchor of the local news show Live at Five.) Twelve years later, all grown up, they showed the Late Show audience how even though they were older and wiser they still owned the five boroughs’ streets; their performance of the 2004 track Ch-Check It Out opened in a subway entrance and wound its way to the Ed Sullivan Theater, with Letterman greeting them like old friends once they eventually made their way to his desk.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Other versions of Dave that people spoke/wrote about included Sad Dave, with Alan Sepinwall giving his saddest moments of Letterman’s reign:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/wayne-cabot/letterman-sepinwall\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F206430158&amp;show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Hollywood Reporter’s tv critic Tim Goodman (AKA Bastard Machine) also gave his <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/bastard-machine/david-letterman-legacy-saying-goodbye-796996\">slightly emotional thoughts</a> about Dave’s departure:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I’ve watched these Letterman farewell episodes and done plenty of tearing up in the process. And I’ve marveled not only at his legacy and endurance and influence (all the obvious things we talk about when someone like Letterman retires), but also simply how much people really do love him and will miss him.</p> \n <p> If you’ve lived long enough and watched enough television you’ve seen plenty of farewells. If there’s anything notable about the departure of a true ground breaker, it’s the legitimate appreciation on hand. You can’t fake some of the tears and the looks these celebrity guests and friends have given him. With the whole late night talk show circuit built on phoniness – which Letterman spent a career tearing down – it’s especially gratifying to see real, unfettered appreciation and respect.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Emotional stuff. But the “unfettered appreciation and respect” isn’t quite universal. <a href=\"http://morningafter.gawker.com/a-brief-history-of-david-letterman-interacting-with-his-1705835543\">Gawker reminded everyone</a> about Creepy Dave with a supercut of all the awkward things he’s said to female guests.

Indeed, most have either cried off out of “respect” for Dave or have dedicated huge segments of their shows to him.</p> \n<h2>Conan O’Brien</h2> \n<p>Conan when for the latter when he recalled the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/conan-obrien-honors-david-letterman-797301\">support Letterman gave him</a> after he took over his slot on NBC in 1993 and was hammered by the critics:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p> “I got the shit kicked out of me. Critics despised me, the ratings were bad, my skin broke out, and my network started to make it clear that I probably wouldn’t be around very long. I honestly have no ill will about that time because, by and large, people were right. I was in way over my head - and with this hair, that’s saying something - and the conventional wisdom was that I should be immediately cancelled.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p> He added that at his personal low point Letterman offered support:</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p> “At one of the lowest points of my life, when I was a 30 year old national punchline, Dave, for reasons I still don’t really understand ---- completely rescued me. I truly believe that simple act of kindness turned everything around and made all the difference.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV7NC0DGgVg\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tV7NC0DGgVg?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2> Jimmy Kimmel</h2> \n<p> Jimmy Kimmel went for the former, deciding against recording a new show and instead going for a rerun. He told the <a href=\"http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/jimmy-kimmel-wont-air-new-794036\">Hollywood Reporter</a>: </p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“I have too much respect for Dave to do anything that would distract viewers from watching his final show. Plus, I’ll probably be crying all day, which makes it hard to work.” </p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Sounds like the worst excuse not to turn up to work ever.</p> \n<h2>Jimmy Fallon</h2> \n<p>Fallon isn’t having any of that nonsense. He’s got a full slate of guests including David Duchovny and, er, Pitbull AKA Mr Worldwide. It’s definitely the b-side but, gives me the opportunity to remind everyone about this brilliant sketch by Limmy that tackles the genuinely baffling ubiquity of Pitbull:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHGN7Q7fKlA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHGN7Q7fKlA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>Jon Stewart</h2> \n<p>The US’s premier political satirist is also taking the night off.

It looks a little like an iPhone 5 from the back, but also rather resembles the Argos MyTablet with white inlaid glass at the top of the back plate.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately the resemblance doesn’t stop there. Despite being thin and well made with smooth sides and a solid back, the finish to the aluminium looks slightly cheap.</p> \n<p>The back also sounds hollow when tapped with a finger, which is surprising given that at 6.4mm thick the P8 is one of the thinnest phones going - the iPhone 6 is 6.9mm thick and the Samsung Galaxy S6 6.8mm.</p> \n<p>The 5.2in full HD screen fills most of the front, with thin bezels at the sides. It’s bright, crisp and good. It’s not quite up to par with the fantastic quad HD screen fitted to either the LG G4 or Galaxy S6, but is easily as good as similar screens fitted to the HTC One M9, for example.</p> \n<p>With a small body and a 5.2in screen, the P8 is one of the most manageable top-end smartphones available at the moment, although people with smaller hands will still struggle to use it one-handed.</p> \n<h2>Specifications</h2> \n<ul> \n <li><strong>Screen:</strong> 5.2in full HD LCD (424ppi)<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Processor: </strong>octa-core Huawei Kirin 930<br /></li> \n <li><strong>RAM: </strong>3GB of RAM<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Storage:</strong> 16GB + microSD card<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Operating system:</strong> Android 5.0 “Lollipop” with Emotion UI<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Camera:</strong> 13MP rear camera with OIS, 8MP front-facing camera<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Connectivity: </strong>Dual-Sim LTE, Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 4.0 and GPS<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Dimensions: </strong>144.9 x 72.1 x 6.4mm<br /></li> \n <li><strong>Weight:</strong> 145g</li> \n</ul> \n<h2>Huawei’s own silicon</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1296e0e26a62220f021e576dea2b2457efefe55c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432051496067/4e7502f3-42e2-4654-9ef7-1f611390fab1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Huawei P8 review\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Two Sims can be used at the same time or one Sim and a microSD card for more storage.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Like Samsung, Huawei designs and makes its own processors. It’s Kirin 930 has similar specifications to Qualcomm and Samsung’s latest, but with slightly less powerful graphics processors.</p> \n<p>The P8 feels snappy, if not quite as quick as the fastest-feeling Android smartphone the Galaxy S6. Performance all round was solid, only stuttering slightly with some graphically heavy gaming.</p> \n<p>I never noticed the phone getting overly hot, which is impressive given how thin it is. Equally impressive is how good the battery life was. Performing general duties, including hundreds of push notifications, email, Twitter, music streaming and an hour of browsing, I got a good two days out of the P8 between charges.</p> \n<p>I also found it got and maintained a stronger 4G signal than any other smartphone I have tested. </p> \n<p>The standard P8 only has 16GB of storage built in, most high-end smartphones now come with 32GB in 2015. It has a microSD card slot for adding more storage for media, but it also doubles as a secondary Sim card slot, allowing users to have two phone numbers and two services attached to one phone.</p> \n<p>Dual-Sim support is extremely handy for those with personal and work numbers, saving needing to carry two phones, as well as those traveling and using a local Sim card.</p> \n<h2>Android, but not as you’d know it</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"778bf593330df94baa518a6b934f3f13944b74d9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432051421167/0e0bf14f-c86e-45fa-ba59-8d4b563fd8f0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Huawei P8 review\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">There’s no app drawer, so all the apps are thrown onto the homescreen, while app icons are circled in an ugly coloured bubble.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The P8 is an Android smartphone running version 5.0 Lollipop. But Huawei modifies Android to look very different calling it “Emotion UI”.</p> \n<p>There is no app drawer, which means that every app is forced onto the homescreen pages, much like an iPhone. The apps can be placed in folders and the homescreens behave like standard Android with moving wallpapers and widgets.</p> \n<p>The notification tray looks and behaves differently. Some apps have multiple notifications – Gmail, for instance, clusters all messages together, but a secondary notification shows each one individually.</p> \n<p>Various themes are available, which change icons as well as colours and backgrounds. Most app icons have a coloured background, which looks a mess; standard Android uses transparent background instead. Other apps have custom icons, which look a bit warped, such as Instagram.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3337255f02e462aa7c2dde73fcdb37fe58fc1773\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432051640187/e8b2094c-5085-4983-bcc5-73d3055ddefd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Huawei P8 review\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The P8 suggests you kill apps in the background that are draining the battery.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The P8 also has a few phone management tools baked in for clearing apps from the RAM. With 3GB of RAM installed, they’re a bit of an overkill, but good for those obsessed with cleaning and tweaking.</p> \n<p>Another interesting addition is a power monitor that warns you when an app is consuming battery power in the background. It rates apps in milliampere hours – a measure of battery capacity – recommending shutting down any app that uses more than 40mAh when not in use. Again this seems like overkill, but could be useful for those trying to eek out every last hour our battery life and the notifications can be turned off if they become annoying.</p> \n<h2>Camera</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2cab5608316a92b6c6b99c2cc367bb74777eae78\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/19/1432051056551/c7d42a15-2325-45de-94c5-b0f352d80de2-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Huawei P8 review\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The camera is solid, the app shows more than a passing resemblance to Apple’s iPhone camera app, but works well enough.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samuel Gibbs for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The 13-megapixel camera is one of the best currently available.

This is one of the most culturally rich city centres in the world. And just a few minutes’ walk south, away from Vienna’s famous attractions, is a very different place altogether, the city’s fourth district – Wieden.</p> \n<p>The roads that lead there aren’t immediately promising. Operngasse is student territory, home to the <a href=\"http://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/tuwien_home/\">University of Technology</a>, and Wiedner Hauptstrasse is a commercial high street.

A group of architects has transformed half a dozen commercial premises, former shops and warehouses, into five individual “hotel rooms”, which are dotted around the district. Ours, The Tailoress, was once a haute couture dressmaker’s studio, and now contained an iMac, a typewriter and an espresso machine, though its past use was hinted at with an entire wall backlit with a giant photograph of a woman in an evening gown. A well-stocked (and happily all-included) minibar completed what Becki described as the “bunker chic” look.</p> \n<p>The architects behind Urbanauts have co-opted their favourite haunts as their “hotel services”. For our breakfast, the bespoke map in the room pointed us towards <a href=\"http://www.cafegoldegg.at/\">Cafe Goldegg</a>, an art deco beauty tucked away on a street behind the Spanish embassy. It was an instant winner – and not just for the generous Viennese omelettes, but also for its panelled booths, its billiard table, and the senior gentlemen who frequented it.

And if we hadn’t got lost on the way to a contemporary art space, who knows if we’d have found the store that sold second-hand lederhosen. There was a flaw in being dropped into the urbane, aspirational Viennese life.

A run of shops on Operngasse, from vintage menswear to fifties modern furniture, looked inviting enough, but even though we studied their complicated opening hours carefully, they were still closed on every occasion we visited. Perhaps the owners were waiting for their orders in the bicycle cafe.</p> \n<p>Wieden isn’t just some hipster paradise. In fact, walking the district provided a reminder of how multicultural Vienna is. For all its high art and ballgowns, the city that was once the nerve centre of a global empire remains varied and cosmopolitan. A few blocks from the grand facades of Austria’s diplomatic embassies, whose flags hung damply in the rain, we stumbled across pockets of thriving Japanese and Chinese businesses, before reaching the area’s celebrated <a href=\"http://www.austria.info/uk/discover/naschmarkt-vienna-2011039.html\">Naschmarkt</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fbc8fae896c6a6e2b0361258a87ac260164cb07\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432134946786/3137e8ef-de0d-4da9-87f6-1278d18f4757-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Naschmarkt, Vienna\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eating out at the Naschmarkt</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Running down a 1.5km strip between two main roads, the 400-year-old market originally sold milk bottles. Today it has specialist tea stalls, Alpine cheese and vegetables galore, but the colours and smells that dominate are those of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. With Italian antipasti and Lebanese sweetmeats vying for our custom, we did the decent thing and bought both, and a side of “mountain salami”. And while we had no intention of doing anything more complicated than scoffing down our treats as an afternoon picnic, we nevertheless passed a happy quarter-hour browsing recipes in <a href=\"http://www.babettes.at/de\">Babette’s</a> (Schleifm&uuml;hlgasse 17, +43 01 585 5165), the nearby shop-cum-bakery that specialises in cookery books, spices, and delectable pastries.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"526faa232305c4d238c3f3438f717b171d561554\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/20/1432135160189/5976dc84-545e-49c6-8c4a-42c893d90c74-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Belvedere, Vienna\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Belvedere, Vienna</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: views.austria.info</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Wieden had one more trick up its sleeve. We may have been eating, drinking and shopping like locals, but there was one place we simply had to embrace our inner tourists: <a href=\"http://www.belvedere.at/en\">Belvedere</a>, the district’s very own Habsburg palace. Its extensive art collection had us enthralled even before we reached the third floor where, in its own special gallery, gleamed Gustav Klimt’s portrait of <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Gustav+Klimt%E2%80%99s+portrait+of+The+Lovers&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7WAAVL7GEuWp7Aa8n4CIAw&amp;ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1824&amp;bih=1030#q=Gustav+Klimt%E2%80%99s+portrait+of+The+Lovers&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbs=sur:fc&amp;facrc=_&amp;imgdii=_&amp;imgrc=-5fEDS61lMeE6M%253A%3B3iKY4Zo2PCHh1M%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252Ff%252Ff3%252FGustav_Klimt_016.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FThe_Kiss_(Klimt)%3B1079%3B1080\">The Lovers</a>, otherwise known as The Kiss.</p> \n<p>After a lifetime of exposure to cheap poster reproductions, the most famous painting in Vienna did not disappoint. We bathed in its vast, golden glow, then headed to a window and looked out on Belvedere’s baroque gardens.

As if that wasn’t already impressive enough, research published today in the <em>Journal of Experimental Biology</em> shows that octopus skin contains the pigment proteins found in eyes, making it responsive to light.</p> \n<p>These clever cephalopods can change colour thanks to specialised cells called chromatophores, which are packed in their thousands just beneath the skin surface. Each of these cells contains an elastic sac of pigmented granules surrounded by a ring of muscle, which relax or contract when commanded by nerves extending directly from the brain, making the colour inside more or less visible. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/neurophilosophy/2015/may/14/fruit-fly-neural-compass-works-like-a-mammals\">The fly's neural compass works just like a mammal's</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Octopuses are thought to rely mainly on vision to bring about these colour changes. Despite apparently being <a href=\"http://jeb.biologists.org/content/70/1/49.full.pdf\">colour blind</a>, they use their eyes to detect the colour of their surroundings, then relax or contract their chromatophores appropriately, which assume one of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2674088/\">three basic pattern templates</a> to camouflage them, all within a fraction of a second. Experiments performed in the 1960s showed that <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010406X66901897\">chromatophores respond to light</a>, suggesting that they can be controlled without input from the brain, but nobody had followed this up until now.</p> \n<p>Evolutionary biologists <a href=\"https://desmondramirez.wordpress.com/\">Desmond Ramirez</a> and <a href=\"https://labs.eemb.ucsb.edu/oakley/todd/members/oakley\">Todd Oakley</a> of the University of California, Santa Barbara therefore removed patches of skin from 11 hatchling and adult bimac octopuses (<em>Octopus bimaculoides</em>), mounted them onto Petri dishes with insect pins, and used light emitting diodes to shine light of different wavelengths onto the skin preparations. They noticed that the chromatophores expanded quickly, and remained expanded, pulsating rhythmically, when exposed to continuous bright white light. By contrast, red light caused slow, rhythmic muscle contractions, but not chromatophore expansion. </p> \n<p>In these, experiments, the chromatophores were most responsive to wavelengths of 480 nanometers (nm, or billionths of a meter), which corresponds to blue light. This also happens to be the wavelength that some <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1088937/\">opsins</a>, the pigmented light-sensitive proteins found in eyes, absorb best. Ramirez and Oakley therefore predicted that opsins are present in octopus skin, where they might act as light sensors.</p> \n<p>To test this, they stained some skin preparations with fluorescently-labelled antibodies that recognise and bind to opsins and other proteins that interact with them. Sure enough, they found that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/neurophilosophy/2014/sep/08/brainy-processing-at-your-fingertips\">sensory neurons</a> in the skin synthesize one version of the opsin protein, along with G protein alpha and phospholipase C, two enzymes that relay signals from opsin molecules that have been activated by light to the interior of the cell, and which are needed to initiate the cellular response. </p> \n<p>Octopuses aren’t unique in this respect, as various other species are now known to have skin that contains opsins and is sensitive to light. But this study provides the first clear evidence that octopus skin is also sensitive to light, and also hints at a plausible mechanism by which chromatophores detect and respond to it. </p> \n<p>Other research shows that the marine <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/species-of-the-day/evolution/platynereis-dumerilii/\">ragworm</a>, a “living fossil” with primitive eyes consisting of patches of opsin-containing cells at the front of its brain, also expresses the same opsin protein in neurons located on the underside of its nerve cord, and in the hair-like appendages it uses to crawl and swim. These primitive creatures continue to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3538230/\">avoid light after being decapitated</a>, suggesting that the opsins found outside their brain are indeed involved in sensing light.</p> \n<p>Ramirez and Oakley believe that octopus skin acts in a similar way. In eyes, opsins are arranged in an organized manner inside photoreceptor cells, so that they can recreate a faithful copy the visual field on the retina. In chromatophores, they are arranged loosely, and so light-sensitive skin would probably detect changes in brightness, rather than forming a detailed image.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/neurophilosophy/2012/apr/27/1\">Magnetosensitive GPS cells in the pigeon brain | Mo Costandi | Neurophilosophy blog</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The researchers also noted that the chromatophores in their skin preparations expanded in response to light touch as well as to light, and their antibody staining experiments revealed that they are expressed in the neurons that are sensitive to mechanical pressure. This raises the intriguing possibility that opsins, which have always been associated with vision, might also contribute to other senses. This is supported by recent studies showing that opsin is present in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/neurophilosophy/2015/may/14/fruit-fly-neural-compass-works-like-a-mammals\">the fruit fly</a> antenna, where it <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867412009269\">detects mechanical vibrations</a>, and is critical for hearing.</p> \n<p>It’s still not entirely clear whether octopus chromatophores act as light sensors, mechanical receptors, or both, but Ramirez and Oakley are planning to find out, in a series of new experiments designed to determine what kind of behaviours they are involved in. The fact that opsins are present in mechanically sensitive cells suggests they have a common and ancient role in these processes. </p> \n<p>Ramirez and Oakley also plan to compare opsins from the skin and eyes of different species, in order to see how they are related, and to determine whether these non-visual light responses co-opted existing opsins, or evolved independently.</p> \n<h2><strong>Reference</strong></h2> \n<p>Ramirez, M.

What do I do now? </strong><em>JG, Bristol</em></p> \n<p>It seems you have been badly let down by the justice system. County court judgments rely on debtors being cooperative citizens with a proper respect for the law. Those who are determined not to pay up can often get away with it because county court bailiffs can, as you’ve found, be breathtakingly ineffectual even though they do have the power to force entry if they have reason to believe the debtor runs a business from the premises. <br /></p> \n<p>You provided that evidence and the address is clear to see on iTech’s website, so the bailiffs should have returned, at no extra cost, when you reissued the warrant. Moreover, if you contest a bailiffs report, the bailiff manager should attend the address in person. iTech, whose website says “we’re just about one thing – tender loving repair” admits to me that it trades from the given address and denies it told the bailiffs otherwise. </p> \n<p>“We didn’t let the bailiffs in because we hadn’t done anything wrong,” says a spokesman who describes himself as the manager. For the same reason, he says, the company, which operates as a sole trader, did not defend itself in the small claims proceedings. </p> \n<p>The Ministry of Justice admits that enforcing judgments can be difficult. High court enforcement officers have better success rates because they are employed by private firms, rather than the court, and paid according to their success.
