It is a legacy of <a href=\"http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng01.html\">the Ainu</a>, the indigenous people often ignored by the rest of Japan, and originates in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2008/mar/29/japan.camping\">Hokkaido</a>, the country’s northernmost and mountainous island.</p> \n<p><em>Ruibe</em> is half-frozen sashimi, usually wild salmon, hauled from Hokkaido’s cold waters. The fish was traditionally frozen in the open air then overwintered under the snow, before being dug up to eat in spring …and the Ainu didn’t wait for it to thaw. It’s literally a melt-in-the-mouth dish.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/mar/10/best-restaurants-kyoto-tokyo-japan-chefs-choice\">The best restaurants in Tokyo and Kyoto – chosen by Japan’s top chefs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nowadays, chefs and home cooks choose salmon “as fat, handsome and fresh as possible”, then simply clean, fillet and freeze it in the freezer, explains chef Shinichi Maeda, who runs <a href=\"http://kiniseko.com/en/dining-ki-niseko\">An Dining at Ki Niseko</a> in Abuta-Gun, Hokkaido. The ruibe is then cut and eaten while still frozen, and served with soy sauce and fresh wasabi.</p> \n<p>“Ruibe’s unique point is its half-frozen texture,” says Yuichi Kamimura, another Hokkaido-born chef and owner of <a href=\"http://www.kamimura-niseko.com\">Kamimura restaurant</a>, also in Abuta-Gun. “It is somewhere between cubed ice and the silkiness of sorbet.”</p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, ruibe translates as “melted food”. Not generally expensive, ruibe can be found on the menus of some of Hokkaido’s <em>izakaya</em> – the casual, local restaurants ubiquitous throughout Japan. But rather like the Ainu and their culture, one has to look hard to find it.

David Williams sifts through the shelves to find the best on offer at Bargain Booze</p>","byline":"David Williams","body":"<p><strong>Ravenswood Old Vine Zinfandel, Lodi, California 2012 (&pound;9.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bargainbooze.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bargain Booze</strong></a><strong>) </strong>From the name on the door to the stuff on the shelves, the frills at Bargain Booze are kept to an absolute minimum. “Lidl Shmidl” says the publicity material, reminding customers that the chain is all about mass-market brands at prices that match the German discounter’s range of never-before-seen lagers and gins. It’s not the sort of place you’d go looking for a natural wine from a tiny producer, just as you wouldn’t go to a chain of butcher’s calling itself Cheap Chicken to pick up an organic free-range bird. But if you have a brand you’re fond of, it’s worth at least checking in at one of BB’s 618 stores – the price of Ravenswood’s consistently sumptuous red, for example, stacks up very well against retailing rivals great and small.</p> \n<p><strong>Otra Vida Malbec, Mendoza, Argentina 2014 (&pound;4.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bargainbooze.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bargain Booze</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Having tasted a small sample of wines on offer at a recent tasting put on by Bargain Booze’s owners, Conviviality Retail, and then nosed around the BB website, I’ve found you have to do a fair bit of digging through some very ordinary stuff to get to the odd gem. The BB range leans heavily on the noxiously sweet and industrial, inexplicably bestselling stuff like Yellowtail, Barefoot and Apothic, or lesser-known names such as the aptly named Crimes Red, Australia 2014 (&pound;7.99), the jarring jammy sweetness of which left my palate feeling violated. The hunt is worthwhile, though: the fragrant, juicy raspberry and cherry of Otra Vida Malbec, from the Argentine operation of Chilean producer Concha y Toro, is, at less than a fiver, a superb barbecue bottle.</p> \n<p><strong>Kosi Bay Sauvignon Blanc, Western Cape, South Africa 2014 (&pound;5.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.bargainbooze.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bargain Booze</strong></a><strong>) </strong>A quid more than the Malbec, but equally good value, is this terrific Cape Sauvignon, which has all the leafy verve, passion fruit and lime I look for in this grape variety in a dry, racy style: highly recommended if you’re having a party over the summer. Even better in terms of quality is the wonderfully relaxed mature Baron de Ley Rioja Gran Reserva 2008. At &pound;19.99, I wouldn’t rush out to buy it, however. Especially when the decidedly more upmarket London merchant Roberson is offering the silkily smooth and savoury joys of Bodegas Las Orcas Decenio Rioja Reserva 2002 at just &pound;12.95. Now that really is some bargain booze.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352108660/wines-of-the-week-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for.","credit":"/PR","altText":"wines of the week","cleanCaption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for."}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T05:00:00Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T05:00:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[{"name":"David Williams","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/david-williams"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Wine","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/wine","webTitle":"Wine"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"David Williams","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/david-williams"}}],"series":{"title":"David Williams's wines of the week","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/david-williams-wines-of-the-week"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/good-wine-at-rock-bottom-prices-david-williams","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4af8q","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/good-wine-at-rock-bottom-prices-david-williams","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/12/good-wine-at-rock-bottom-prices-david-williams"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352108660/wines-of-the-week-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for.","credit":"/PR","altText":"wines of the week","cleanCaption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for."}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Drink"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352108660/wines-of-the-week-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for.","credit":"/PR","altText":"wines of the week","cleanCaption":"Wines of the week: three cheap-at-the-price bottles to look out for."}}]},{"title":"Children and teenagers / How to take your book blog to the next level","rawTitle":"How to take your book blog to the next level","item":{"type":"article","id":"childrens-books-site/2015/jul/12/take-your-book-blog-to-the-next-level-top-tips","title":"How to take your book blog to the next level","trailText":"You’ve started your book blog, but how can you get it past the beginner stage with so many blogs trying to do the same thing?

Here are my top tips for building your blog after you’ve set it up:</p> \n<p><strong>1. Set clear objectives</strong></p> \n<p>Take a piece of paper or a notebook, and write down five things you’d like to achieve with your blog. Once you’ve got your five things, expand on each by thinking when you’d like to achieve them by, how attainable they are, and how you’re going to know when you’ve reached your goal. For example, a good objective may be “I want to reach 500 blog followers by January 1<sup>st</sup>.” It’s easily measurable, clear, and you have something to work towards.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/childrens-books-site/2014/dec/29/how-to-start-a-book-blog\">How to start a book blog</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>2. Put in blood, sweat, and tears</strong></p> \n<p>Dedication is a key skill you need in order to build your blog. No matter how much time you have to work on your blog, you can still put in a lot of effort. Someone who works hard for ten minutes can work just as hard as someone working for an hour that isn’t putting hard work into a task. All of your commitment will pay off in the end!</p> \n<p><strong>3. Experiment and try new things</strong></p> \n<p>One of the things I love most about blogging is being able to think up new ideas that haven’t been done before, and being adventurous with the content I create. It makes things less repetitive for you and your reader!</p> \n<p><strong>4. Don’t be afraid to ask for help</strong></p> \n<p>There are so many other bloggers that are very helpful and friendly. The relationships you make through blogging make your blogging experience so much better so don’t be scared! Make friends and you can all help each other out on your blogging journeys.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/childrens-books-site/2015/apr/11/what-shall-i-read-next-a-guide-to-ukya-day\">What shall I read next? A guide to UKYA</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>5. Have fun!</strong></p> \n<p>Whilst you’re working extremely hard, don’t forget to have fun along the way. I’m sure the reason you started blogging was to enjoy it! Take a break every now and again, and reward yourself too. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/childrens-books-site/2015/jun/16/whats-happening-at-yalc-2015-schedule\">Yalc 2015: who's on and what's happening?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>Good luck!</strong><br /></p> \n<ul> \n <li>Find out more on <strong>LucyTheReader’s blog</strong> <a href=\"http://queenofcontemporary.com/\">Queen of Contemporary</a>.
