For episode two, click <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/21/humans-recap-season-one-episode-two-whos-real-whos-synth\">here</a></em></p> \n<p>If Humans has left you only mildly unnerved until now, this is a real sleep-disturber of an episode. Mortality, consciousness and the prospect of a synth serial killer? That’ll do nicely.<br /></p> \n<p>Fred the half-synth wakes up under observation in the lab, where Hob has a theory. “There are five of you, I think,” he concludes. “One of the others is this female. You were created by David Elster. He kept your existence a secret. When he died, you ran. And hid. You were split up.”<br /></p> \n<p>The synths-on-the-run have everything they need for survival in their backpacks, including food and water. Crafty human hybrids.<br /></p> \n<h2>‘Mum’s taking Anita back’</h2> \n<p>Despite the fact that two-thirds of her children worship Anita, Laura is determined to return the glassy-eyed pillar of domestic perfection to her manufacturer.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Laura’s driving Anita out of her life; in the back seat, the synth smiles that innocent smile of hers. But Toby’s having none of it and he jumps on his bike and sets off in hot pursuit of his synthetic crush.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>You thought Anita was useful when she carved an apple into the shape of a duck? Pah, that was nothing. Seeing Toby in danger, she sacrifices her own safety and stops a white van that is just about to knock him off his bike.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<h2>‘I’ve seen a million dollies’</h2> \n<p>Meanwhile, Leo and his broken heart are hitting the bottle. He’s missing Mia/Anita and Max thinks they should keep searching for her.<br /></p> \n<p>The wallowing is cut short at the news of an incident down at the synth brothel, where Niska is a wanted woman. The sleazy punter she took down last week is lying cold on the floor and the madame of the establishment knows who is to blame. “I’ve seen a million dollies,” she says. “And I know my mods too.”<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Wisely, Niska has left the scene of the crime and popped to the shopping centre to use the recharging point and pick up a few new clothes. Then it’s on to a bar, where she’s on the receiving end of a cheesy chat-up line that leads her back to a stranger’s house, where she comes dangerously close to using the knifeblock.<br /></p> \n<h2>‘A sex game gone wrong’</h2> \n<p>“This has been coming, we all know that,” says DS Drummond, who is not a synth fan and only has one at home because the insurance company paid for it. His superior is keen to hush up the fact that a synth has killed a human. Instead of a murder, it’ll be sold as a “sex game gone wrong”.</p> \n<p>“People have a right to know if their dollies are going to start strangling them,” insists Drummond.</p> \n<h2>‘If they find you, they’ll recycle you’</h2> \n<p>Murder is one thing, but is there a synth more chilling than Vera? Here she is, spouting information in that synth-knows-best style until Dr Millican locks her in the living room. It takes her a while to notice because she’s surveying the furniture like a microchipped Kirstie Allsopp and by the time she busts the doorknob off, Odi is out of the summerhouse and back in the game. Who’s the jailer now, you po-faced NHS-grade dolly?<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>But Millican and Odi’s freedom doesn’t last long, like their country drive. Maybe their time has come. “If they find you, they’ll recycle you,” warns Millican as he consigns Odi to a life in the woods.</p> \n<h2>‘It’s not real, it’s not real’</h2> \n<p>So Anita has won a reprieve and the pecking order is re-established as Laura wheels Toby’s bike home while the synth gets to ride shotgun with Joe. “What were you going to do anyway?” smirks Mattie to her brother. “Ride off into the sunset with her on your handlebars?”</p> \n<p>The accident has left Anita damaged. “For insurance purposes, you should carry out a full inspection of my epidermis,” she informs Joe, as father and son exchange knowing looks. And no matter how many times Joe repeats: “It’s not real, it’s not real,” he’s still just a man in the garage, looking at every inch of Anita’s naked body.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Laura is still grilling Anita, and when the synth shows an understanding of human emotion that goes beyond her job description, it only adds fuel to her fire. But Anita proves her synth credentials by inserting a cocktail stick into her own eyeball without flinching.<br /></p> \n<p>It’s Mattie who gets the biggest breakthrough. “You’re a weirdo, Anita,” she says, downloading her data. “I’m going to find out why.” As she tinkers under the bonnet of her brain, the real Anita comes to life for one terrifying moment. “Help me!” she screams, her human side leaking out in a shockingly effective bit of personality switching by Gemma Chan. Mia’s in there somewhere and when Mattie posts her data dump on an internet forum, it alerts Max and Leo that she’s still around …<br /></p> \n<h2>Notes and queries</h2> \n<p>Niska is unrepentant about killing a man. “You talk about life like it can’t be manufactured,” she argues. Her morals are sometimes human, sometimes synth.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>Synth-with-benefits Simon continues to serve Jill by suggestively rolling out pastry with her.<br /></p> \n<p>The big question: who is Tom and why does the mention of him touch a nerve with Laura?</p> \n<p>Mattie’s had a glimpse of Anita’s human side, so will she soften towards her? The stroppy teenager could be her escape route.</p> \n<p>Anyone else think the Laura and Anita storyline would make a great suburban synth sitcom, like a futuristic Terry and June?<br /></p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508380000/8794a67c-958f-40bb-8928-01c0d0ca251f-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Channel 4","altText":"Anita … can she withstand Laura’s attempts to get rid of her?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Channel 4"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-28T21:00:08Z","lastModified":"2015-06-28T21:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":42,"contributors":[{"name":"Hannah Verdier","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/hannah-verdier"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Humans","Television","Television & radio","Culture","Drama"],"tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/humans","webTitle":"Humans"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/drama","webTitle":"Drama"}],"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Hannah Verdier","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/hannah-verdier"}}],"series":{"title":"Humans: episode by episode","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/tv-and-radio/series/humans-episode-by-episode"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"tv-and-radio"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/28/humans-recap-season-one-episode-three-having-a-synth-proves-a-lifesaver","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a4dc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/28/humans-recap-season-one-episode-three-having-a-synth-proves-a-lifesaver","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/28/humans-recap-season-one-episode-three-having-a-synth-proves-a-lifesaver"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435508380000/8794a67c-958f-40bb-8928-01c0d0ca251f-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Anita … can she withstand Laura’s attempts to get rid of her?

With the weak euro attracting ever more tourists, and as many as 2.5 million visitors disembarking from cruise ships a year, residents are feeling besieged.</p> \n<p>“People push us, give us dirty looks and make nasty remarks when we’re showing tourists around,” said Mari Pau Alonso, president of Barcelona’s Association of Professional Tourist Guides.</p> \n<p>Even Jordi Clos, head of the city’s hoteliers’ association, which wants to see visitor numbers rise to 10 million, says there is an “urgent need” to make citizens more sympathetic to tourists, given the “sense of being overwhelmed” that people have experienced in recent years.</p> \n<p>“If we don’t want to end up like Venice, we will have to put some kind of limit in Barcelona,” said Ada Colau, the city’s new mayor, shortly after she was elected in May. She is proposing a moratorium on new hotels and licences for apartments rented to tourists.</p> \n<p>A survey for the Exceltur tourist group revealed that there are now twice as many beds available in tourist apartments – some 138,000 – as there are in hotels.</p> \n<p>Tourist flats offer a more attractive and economic deal to visitors, and their owners can expect rents at least 125% higher than they would receive from long-term tenants. While many are let through large online organisations, such as Airbnb, others are offered by homeowners trying to make ends meet during Spain’s prolonged recession.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"67eea1c531af5ada6e7010b882990e6cbd7c6691\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/67eea1c531af5ada6e7010b882990e6cbd7c6691/167_0_4824_2893/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barcelona’s beaches\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barcelona’s beaches show another side to the city.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Manu Fernandez/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Tourists spend 25m euros (&pound;18m) a day in the city, and the industry accounts for 15% of Barcelona’s GDP and about 120,000 jobs. No one wants to drive tourists away, says Colau, but if the city becomes a “theme park” people will stop coming.</p> \n<p>Ciutat Vella, the heart of old Barcelona and one of the most popular districts among tourists, has lost 13,000 residents in eight years, driven out by high rents and the relentless noise of tourism. Many areas, such as the famous Las Ramblas or the area around the <a href=\"http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/\">Sagrada Familia</a> church, are in effect no-go areas for residents.</p> \n<p>Colau suggests encouraging tourists to visit other parts of the city, but visitors are drawn to the old city, the <a href=\"http://www.globotreks.com/destinations/10-gaudi-buildings-barcelona/\">Antoni Gaud&iacute; buildings</a> and <a href=\"http://www.barcelona-tourist-guide.com/en/areas/barceloneta-beach-area.html\">Barceloneta</a>’s beaches. The city is the Mediterranean cruise capital and ships, some carrying thousands of passengers, have a huge impact. Passengers are disgorged at the city’s main sights and then leave, having bought little more than a souvenir and a bottle of water during their time ashore.</p> \n<p>Their social impact is seen by many as hugely outweighing their financial contribution, leading some, Clos among them, to suggest a tax on cruises. So far, the 7m euros annual tax on hotels has been spent on promoting tourism, but the Catalan parliament is now considering using it to alleviate the industry’s effects.</p> \n<p>Francesc Mu&ntilde;oz, professor of urbanisation at Barcelona’s Universitat Aut&ograve;noma, goes further. “Why can’t hotel chains finance schools and nurseries?” he asks. “Why can’t cruise companies pay for roadworks?” That way, he argues, residents would see some palpable return for putting up with the tourist invasion.</p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f4557d1a4a6fac9c55e930c672433871e875c606/0_209_4104_2463/4104.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2463,"width":4104,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Amos Chapple/Rex","altText":"Barcelona","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Amos Chapple/Rex"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/67eea1c531af5ada6e7010b882990e6cbd7c6691/167_0_4824_2893/4824.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2893,"width":4824,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Barcelona’s beaches show another side to the city.

How is your Glastonbury?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nadezhda:</strong> We just arrived before our performance so we didn’t see much, but we like the audience and it was probably the best questions we’ve faced in our experience. It’s very political. Active!</p> \n<p><strong>How does that compare with Russian festivals?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nadezhda:</strong> In Russia we also have rock festivals, but we have guys like him [points at Pyotr] at rock festivals.</p> \n<p>[G2 laughs]</p> \n<p><strong>Nadezhda:</strong> That’s not a joke.</p> \n<p><strong>Maria:</strong> Because of the money which rock festivals took from the government, they look not like this. Are they corporate? Unfortunately, yes. But some of the underground clubs try to do independent festivals and succeed.</p> \n<p><strong>What would Vladimir Putin make of Glastonbury? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Maria:</strong> He will not have this opportunity. I think it’s not for him.</p> \n<p><strong>So, where did you get the military truck? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Pyotr:</strong> Well, when we had a rally down in the Park stage, I gave a speech and said that today is the founding day of Glastonbury’s People’s Republic. And as with any people’s republic, you need surplus military vehicles. So we just purchased them down at the corner store along with some equipment and some clothes.</p> \n<p><strong>Er, is that a real gun?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Pyotr:</strong> Obviously it is, look at it. [Rests his hand proudly on it.] Look at the weight, it’s heavy!</p> \n<p><strong>How did you get it in? We couldn’t get a glass bottle of whisky through the gate.</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Pyotr:</strong> Well, you know.

Where do we start?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Maria:</strong> It’s the decision of every person and some of the riots can be inside riots, inside you, rather than going and attacking people.</p> \n<p><strong>So, the Glastonbury’s People’s Republic, eh? How do we sign up?</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Pyotr:</strong> Well, you buy your own military vehicles, you recruit men who will fearlessly fight to separate the republic from the United Kingdom and then install nice conservative values here, not the bullshit you have going on down in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe. People in Donetsk [the Ukrainian city held by pro-Russian separatists since 2014] and other parts of the Russian world are really having a nice time these days, so we just need people down in Glastonbury to really feel their power.</p> \n<p><strong>You said on stage that you wanted the crowd to inspire Russian peace. How do we do that then – buy a stranger some chunky chips and funky dips? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Maria:</strong> By music! If music will become more political like it was in the 60s and 70s we will be happier.</p> \n<p><strong>You were introduced on stage by Charlotte Church. She said that she was inspired by your ideas. Did she have anything to inspire you? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nadezhda:</strong> She just told us that she’s not usually an interviewer, so we appreciated that she decided to be an interviewer especially for us. It’s a big honour. She’s a real cool activist right now, so it was cool to have a chat with her.</p> \n<p><strong>Pyotr:</strong> I asked her to perform at the foundation concert for Glastonbury’s People’s Republic and she agreed. We have plans to turn her into one of the pop icons of the new republic.</p> \n<p><strong>Who do you want to see while you’re here? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nadezhda:</strong> I want to see some food.</p> \n<p><strong>People know you for political acts designed to shock. I’ve seen some pretty shocking things at Glastonbury. Do you think this crowd is unshockable? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Maria:</strong> I don’t think people come here for shock. But they come here for inspiration. If we found a way to do that, it’s a pleasure for us.</p> \n<p><strong>The crowd thought it was quite shocking when Pyotr started talking, in character, about banning gay parades. They didn’t know what to make of it. </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nadezhda:</strong> It’s cool to explore what can embarrass people in different countries because this type of character is a usual character for Russians. People will applaud him and nobody would be embarrassed.</p> \n<p><strong>Pyotr:</strong> If you had said the same words in Russia, you’d definitely get a massive cheer. And people would be incredibly happy that their hero has appeared.</p> \n<p><strong>OK, time for the really important question. How do the Glastonbury toilets compare with the ones in a Russian penal colony? </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nadezhda:</strong> Yes, I visited the toilets. But they’re better than the penal colony.</p> \n<p><strong>Maria:</strong> What’s wrong with the toilets?</p> \n<p><strong>No, not these nice ones backstage. The ones out in the campsite. </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Nadezhda:</strong> It’s cool. I’ve seen some pictures. It’s not so bad. At least they have doors. In penal colonies they don’t have doors.

Almost certainly the buyer of this property is someone represented by someone, and so they should have just carried on, in my view, trying to place it in the market and find a suitable buyer that way.”</p> \n<p>All the same, he said, the fact that the house hadn’t sold meant only “that the right buyer hasn’t come along. Once you get in that rarified space [at the very top of the market] you have to wait for that person to come along. It doesn’t mean that the house is not a good house or the price is not a correct price.”</p> \n<p>The decision to sell off the contents “could just be a tidying up operation”, he said. “Sometimes people think: ‘Well, we have the contents, we might as well sell those now.’ Some people say, ‘Let’s get a bit of money out now.’”</p> \n<p>But, while 2-8a Rutland Gate, personally decorated before his death by the exclusive interior designer <a href=\"http://www.albertopinto.com/1en.aspx\">Alberto Pinto</a>, has evidently cost many millions to furnish, Flynn’s ambitions are considerably more modest for what he will expect in return: “We would be disappointed if we didn’t achieve &pound;450,000 in total.” <br /></p> \n<p>Wasn’t there at least a premium attached to objects that had once stood in Britain’s most expensive house? “At the end of the day, my perspective is that this is second-hand furniture, albeit very luxurious furniture, and where it comes from is neither here nor there.”</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435504564926/0670bc3f-9b63-44ef-bbe7-056ce5e47c5e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graham Turner/Graham Turner","altText":"2-8a Rutland Gate was the London home of the late Lebanese prime minister, Rafik Hariri, and Sultan bin Abdulaziz of Saudi Arabia.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graham Turner/Graham Turner"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435504740044/6fad5c02-7565-455a-a364-bf5ca3f6a502-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The auctioneer suggests that the sumptuous Baldi bathrooms, in which a bathtub alone would have cost tens of thousands of pounds, could auction in their entirety for just a few hundred pounds.

The green caterpillar with yellow stripes and collar is the larva of the common quaker, a neat, drab-coloured moth, as its name suggests; this grub appears to flourish on the leaves of any tree, and it was engaged in devouring the foliage of the pear when it was found; it is abundant and destructive. But he also sent me two green larvae, somewhat slug-like in shape, but with the power of lengthening out after the manner of a leech; these are as much our friends as the other green grubs are our foes. These sluggish larvae, hardly noticeable as they cling to the underside of rose or fruit tree leaves, will eventually turn into those beautiful and exceedingly active flies which poise with whirring wings above the flowers in our gardens, every now and then darting to one side or the other with a sudden jerk. There are few more voracious devourers of aphides, or green flies, than these hover-fly larvae, and, as every gardener knows, the aphis is a destructive pest. There are many books dealing with insect pests, but few give any information about insect friends; it is true that the hover-fly larvae are mentioned as natural checks on the increase of green fly and other destructive insects in several Board of Agriculture pamphlets, but in one only have I seen any attempt to describe the insect, and no figure is given. How is the puzzled agriculturist to know what to kill and what to preserve?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae422d41d786709c01705220690c8ef7275bdef8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435061609727/08e19727-8e11-44f3-98cc-ab222d37b17e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Manchester Guardian, 2 July 1915.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Manchester Guardian, 2 July 1915.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Environment","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435232833218/58f443fa-cc10-4fcf-9972-71dcf8f83753-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"H Lansdown/Alamy","altText":"Common Quaker moth (Orthosia cerasi) caterpillar feeding on elm leaves.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: H Lansdown/Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435061610456/ab87bc22-e22e-4306-ad07-4131e28e5191-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Manchester Guardian, 2 July 1915.","credit":"The Guardian","altText":"The Manchester Guardian, 2 July 1915.","cleanCaption":"The Manchester Guardian, 2 July 1915."}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-28T21:30:09Z","lastModified":"2015-06-28T21:33:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":2,"contributors":[{"name":"Thomas Coward","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/thomas-coward"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Environment","Rural affairs","Insects","Gardening advice","Gardens","Wildlife"],"tags":[{"id":"environment/environment","webTitle":"Environment"},{"id":"uk/ruralaffairs","webTitle":"Rural affairs"},{"id":"environment/insects","webTitle":"Insects"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/gardeningadvice","webTitle":"Gardening advice"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/gardens","webTitle":"Gardens"},{"id":"environment/wildlife","webTitle":"Wildlife"}],"section":{"id":"environment"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Thomas Coward","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/thomas-coward"}}],"series":{"title":"Country diary","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/series/country-diary"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"environment"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jun/28/country-diary-insect-friend-foe-garden","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3ga","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/environment/2015/jun/28/country-diary-insect-friend-foe-garden","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/28/country-diary-insect-friend-foe-garden"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435232833218/58f443fa-cc10-4fcf-9972-71dcf8f83753-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Common Quaker moth (Orthosia cerasi) caterpillar feeding on elm leaves.

Meal for two, including drinks and service: &pound;130</h2> \n<p><br />A restaurant of quiet ambition, located within a fancy auction house, is a whole bunch of dreadful, overwrought analogies just waiting to happen. It didn’t help that, on the day we visited the restaurant inside Bonhams on London’s New Bond Street, the galleries were filled with glorious works. There were Hockneys and Auerbachs, Rileys and Hodgkins. Another room displayed sleek Art Deco pieces all of which I coveted. In the long dirty fight to find ways by which fragile words might be bent to the service of robust flavours, ignoring the possibilities of the language of art when it is so plainly offered really is tough. How easy to talk of “provenance” and the “masterpiece” and of the “acutely composed”. Still I’ll do my best, even though Tom Kemble’s cooking is about as good a candidate for this sort of guff as I’ve come across in a long while.</p> \n<p>The six-month-old restaurant at Bonhams, which is open for breakfast and lunch and for a set menu on Thursday nights only, is literally one of London’s hidden gems. You have to know it’s there to know it’s there. Step through the small street entrance into the airy galleries beyond. Take the lift down a couple of floors, go through the bar, and back up the staircase at the end to find yourself in a small white box of a room with 20 seats and a view of a bland Mayfair courtyard. The walls are hung with prints of food-heavy still lifes of the sort wealthy men used to commission in the 16th century merely to prove they could afford the newfangled pigments needed to portray red, bleeding meat.</p> \n<p>The paintings are misdirection. Kemble’s food is in no way heavy or burdened by luxury for its own sake. It is calm and thoughtful and precise and really quite startlingly beautiful. It’s serious cooking of the best sort, which is to say the kind that makes you giggle with pleasure.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"56968bbbae01e50172bcd974408a5c9d674627f9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435069750589/a0bbd611-08c6-4127-bceb-efe7a07f80ae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gazpacho with mustard ice cream and a floating flower\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A masterpiece: the gazpacho with mustard ice cream. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Prior to a stint at a Chiswick restaurant, Kemble worked for Magnus Nilsson at F&auml;viken in Sweden and brings back with him less a Scandinavian agenda – in our meal the mood was lighter and sunnier and altogether more Francophile – but an obsessive’s commitment to quality raw materials. The cooking served some of the finest ingredients I have come across in a long while. Plus, he has all the skills. At the beginning there is some of the very best bread, a crunchy crusted sour dough with an addictively chewy crumb, served with the sort of yellow Normandy butter you could smear on a close friend. At the end there are liquid salt caramels that will give any of the chocolate specialists at work today a serious case of envy.</p> \n<p>In between there is a thoughtful menu with just three choices at each course, which changes gradually, week by week and day by day, depending on what’s good. Starters are around &pound;10, mains in the mid-20s with desserts at &pound;8. Or think of it as &pound;45 for three courses if that helps (which is the price for the supper club). Bargains are relative. For cooking of this quality in London right now, that’s a bargain. We begin with a gazpacho with mustard ice cream. It’s not an original idea. Both Alain Passard at L’Arp&egrave;ge in Paris and Heston Blumenthal at the Fat Duck have done versions. This one has a lightness of touch, the glossy cold soup having a power and intensity that forces you to stare into the bowl and think only of sunshine and languor. Crisp garlicky croutons bob at the surface and in the depths are pieces of smoked eel lending a hit of the docks. And then, in the middle, is a quenelle of just-set mustard ice cream, providing less heat than a potent savoury grounding.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2d829b1d2a45682b93a2acd70bb7c87109d8da6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435070051007/3681c26d-658e-41ba-9deb-ffd4f28622b8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Slices of duck breast and boned-out confit leg on a round plate\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The duck breast and boned-out confit leg. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Steamed courgette flowers, as delicate as a dandelion head ready to blow away on the breeze, come filled with white crab meat. There are slices of bull’s heart tomato, confited to make them more themselves, a tiny dice of crunchy courgette and a puddle of warm, foamy crab bisque, which is where the intense throb of the brown meat has gone to live out its days.</p> \n<p>There is the same intensity to the frothy, brassic green beurre blanc with a slab of turbot, cooked to an acutely timed mother-of-pearl. A heap of wilted spinach underneath, a length of charred cucumber alongside, a few peeled and smoked Jersey Royals for company and the job is done. Likewise, with slices of duck breast, and a boned-out confit leg, with crisped skin, made shameless by the fat it has been long-cooked in. They share a plate with baby beets, halved cherries, the crack of fresh almonds and an underlying sauce of all these things. There is nothing attention-seeking about this food; it is just great ingredients given a seeing to by a chap who cares.</p> \n<p>To finish there is raspberry millefeuille, the delicate wafers dusted with ground down, freeze-dried fruit, enclosing layers of a loose cr&egrave;me Chantilly and a bright elderflower sorbet. All around are perfect raspberries the colour of opera plush. A floating island is a thick disc of lightly set meringue under a sim card-thin disc of chocolate with, on the top, a mound of pistachio ice cream and all around a moat of cr&egrave;me anglaise.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1d5d0f9d89e40c7786a900808207af9562072a8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435070211028/a63e9809-e77c-440e-b29f-2acec560dbc1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The delicate-wafered raspberry millefeuille.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘There are perfect raspberries the colour of opera plush’: the delicate-wafered raspberry millefeuille.

London may be a feverish restaurant city right now, but there is very little of true brilliance. Last week at the Marksman was one kind; this is quite another. It helps that Bonhams is a serious wine dealership and has used that expertise to pull together a clever list. Given what passes through the building they could have built some thumping, tiresome bible. Instead this is a measured selection. At the top end I’m told some of the bottles are cheaper than retail. More relevant is the ever-changing list of wines by the glass, allowing you to try big Burgundies and Bordeaux you might not otherwise be able to afford.</p> \n<p>At the end of a lunch of hushed brilliance my companion implores me not to write anything. Let it stay a hidden gem, this back London room, bathed in a sunlight that drifts across the room and reaches the plate. I shake my head. It’s not what I do. I always share the good news. That’s how it is. She understands. And with that we slip from the table and return to the galleries to browse all the beautiful things we cannot afford to buy.</p> \n<h2>Jay’s news bites</h2> \n<p>■ For another food experience in a retail environment, try The Man Behind The Curtain, located inside Flannels department store in Leeds.

No glass pipes, no plants to tend at home. Instead, the nation’s latest medical marijuana programme is a world of pill bottles and vials of marijuana-infused oil.</p> \n<p>For the qualifying patients seeking relief from pain, medical marijuana advocates and some lawmakers, Wednesday isn’t the finish line, but the first step. The state’s restrictive approach, unseen in the industry, is likely to mean high costs, long drives and reluctant doctors.</p> \n<p>“The door is opening,” said Bob Cappechi of the Marijuana Policy Project, a national outfit that pushes to loosen marijuana laws. “This will start helping people out. That’s really what this is all about.”</p> \n<p>Minnesota’s medical marijuana advocates snatched an unlikely victory from the legislature last year after years of failed efforts, but there was little celebration. What emerged to assuage skeptical law enforcement lobbyists and a wary governor was one of the strictest programs in the nation.</p> \n<p>Smoking the plant is forbidden. Pills, oils and vapors are only available to patients suffering from severe conditions, such as cancer, epilepsy, HIV and Aids. And the medicine can only be sold in eight locations, hundreds of miles away from some in Minnesota’s rural expanses.</p> \n<p>The two companies growing, cultivating and selling marijuana for the state say Minnesota stands out for its medical approach to a nearly 20-year-old industry that uses terms like “budtender” (salesmen) and “California Kush” (a strain of marijuana).</p> \n<p>“The industry doesn’t do it this way,” Dr. Kyle Kingsley said just days before opening Minnesota Medical Solutions’ first dispensing clinic in Minneapolis. “It’s all new.”</p> \n<p>Kathy Schroeder’s difficult path shows how the medical polishes on Minnesota’s program look more like hurdles to some patients. On paper, her multiple sclerosis and glaucoma – two of the nine conditions that qualify – made her a perfect fit. But like many residents, the 63-year-old struggled to get a doctor’s signature to sign up for the program.</p> \n<p>Prodding a second doctor paid off for her, but Schroeder isn’t sure whether she can even afford a month’s worth of medicine, which Kinglsey said may sell for up to $600. Still, she’ll make the 180-mile round trip Wednesday from her home near Rochester to MinnMed’s Minneapolis facility.</p> \n<p>“I knew it was going to be bad, I had no idea it was going to be this bad,” her daughter, Maren Schroeder, said.</p> \n<p>State representative Carly Melin sympathizes. The Democrat faced criticism for watering down her medical marijuana bill to get police and Governor Mark Dayton on board.</p> \n<p>“We weren’t going to get anything done if we didn’t pass this law,” Melin said.</p> \n<p>Kinglsey said he’s confident doctors and hospital systems will eventually approve, but it’s made for a slow start to a program that’s supposed to sign up 5,000 people. As of Friday morning, just 65 patients were completely registered and another 74 were being processed.</p> \n<p>Cappechi and other advocates already have ideas for how to improve it: allow more than eight dispensaries, add more manufacturers and patients who suffer from chronic pain, and perhaps lift the ban on smoking the drug.</p> \n<p>But before expanding, Dr Andrew Bachman, co-founder of the state’s other medical marijuana manufacturer, LeafLine Labs, said they need time to show lawmakers and doctors alike that the new industry works.</p> \n<p>That starts Wednesday, he said.</p> \n<p>“Ideology does not change overnight.
