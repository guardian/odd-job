But, although your mug clearly has sentimental value, does the head of international marketing need their day interrupted to know about it? Does every single member of the catering team need to empathise with your struggle? Is Dipesh, who works at the outsourced IT department in Bangalore, really likely to have it? Oh, and now look! Every budding office stand-up is chiming in with some cracking “reply all” banter about where the mug could be! </p> \n<h2>The screen rubbernecker</h2> \n<p>Look mate, it’s hard enough to <em>work</em> in here with you craning your head towards my desk, vaguely pretending to be looking at some distant wall planner that is clearly not within the range of any human eye. So imagine how hard it is to <em>skive</em>. Basically, I came into work today with two specific and achievable goals: to find out who my colleague Sara snogged last night, and to run down the clock cracking some jokes on Google chat. Your rubbernecking is ruining my productivity by, like, 85%.</p> \n<h2>The YouTube menace<br /></h2> \n<p>Countless amounts of money have been spent looking into smart ways to increase productivity: switching around the desks, digitising calendars, hiring someone to come in and walk around looking sinister with a clipboard for a few days. Little do companies realise that they could double their output simply by locating that guy Dan who keeps interrupting you to show a German clip of Hitler in Downfall – hilariously subtitled to reflect Crystal Palace’s 2013 promotion to the Premier League – and unplugging his ISDN cable. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7mT9FM8BVw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/a7mT9FM8BVw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<h2>The tech warrior<br /></h2> \n<p>They’ve got the latest smartwatch, which unleashes an ironic blast of Crazy Frog every time their latest Vine gets liked.

Now it has become accepted practice to abandon work for an indeterminate amount of time to attain, Blumenthal-style, the perfect brew. This is not sensible practice if you work in a coffee shop, so it’s certainly not on when you’re handling admin in HR. And yet there you are, slowly <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jan/06/from-coffee-makers-to-cameras-six-gadgets-to-simplify-your-life\">assembling an AeroPress pump</a> and blooming your grinds with a drip kettle, or heading to the local deli and waiting until Maurizio (real name: Dave) is available because he once won an award for his macchiato foam in 2009. “I need it to get me through the day,” you hear them say. Yes, and by the time they’ve got the damn thing, they’re already halfway there.</p> \n<h2>The online over-shopper</h2> \n<p>The post-room staff have developed impressive biceps since they joined the company: lugging their parcels up the stairs for other people to sign for while they’re trying on jeans in the quiet room, deciding they don’t quite fit, and sticking them back in the postbox to go back to the shop.</p> \n<h2>The real talker</h2> \n<p>It’s almost as if some people never had it explained to them that “How’s it going?” roughly translates to: “Please make three similar noises back, ensuring that we don’t have to endure a meaningful conversation for the next 17 years.” Instead, they treat it as a fresh inquiry, to which they are sworn to deliver the grim news that things are actually going shit: their relationship has gone to the dogs, their bus broke down, and their key snapped in the lock last night and they had to get a locksmith out and when he arrived he hadn’t brought the right equipment and then … are you bored yet? </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f144d5f6eae645e4f69b77aceea52a509a3004a3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432658907553/2660c967-a125-484c-bb9e-a0bf9bff65dc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"If it's not yet a Ralf Little sitcom, it's not interesting.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">If it’s not yet a Ralf Little sitcom, it’s not interesting.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC TWO/MATT SQUIRE</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The Tinder tragedist</h2> \n<p>Just because there is little drama inherent in working for a frozen-food conglomerate, doesn’t mean their role is to invent some.

Well, you don’t exactly eat them together. The construction of the pizza allows you to eat the pie separately – it’s not smeared across the toppings like roadkill. Instead you eat them one after the other like a greedy guest at a child’s birthday party. <br /></p> \n<p>I like pies – even bad ones. For years I sold Four’N Twenties at Melbourne’s cricket ground that could simultaneously burn your tongue and turn your stomach. But this ... this thing that was delivered to our office had no resemblance to the purity of the pies I knew of yore. It was instead a sort of Frankenfood. Will this be our undoing? So here’s what our top taste-testing team thought of it:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fddd48b1a61a8677dc99b11f691baef3d29804d8\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/fddd48b1a61a8677dc99b11f691baef3d29804d8/0_1269_2013_1208/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The team digs in.

Mmmm.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fred McConnell for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Patrick Keneally</strong>: Modern pizza, it is said, evolved from flatbreads in Greek and Roman times topped with oil, herbs or whatever could be rustled up to feed hungry workers. Now 2,000 years of culinary advancement has brought us to this – a pizza with some frozen party pies stuck into the dough. </p> \n<p>Pies and pizzas, individually, are wonderful. Together, they could have been good and, in the spirit of its working-class ancestor, topping dough with whatever was at hand might have worked. But this is just cheap – and a bit nasty. </p> \n<p>The joy of a pie is in its flaky, crisp pastry. In Pizza Hut’s attempt, frozen pies are popped in to the edges, surrounded by mounds of pizza dough, making the bases soft and soggy. There is altogether too much dough and pastry, none of it crisp. The only way it would possibly be good is after about 10 cans of beer.</p> \n<p><strong>Adam Brereton</strong>: Plopping a tiny, tasteless pie on each pizza slice piece – there was barely any mince to be seen – is the latest attempt to solve Pizza Hut’s crust problem. Some variants minimise it (thin ‘n’ crispy) or eliminate it all together (deep dish). But both concede what we all already know: unlike high-end gourmet stuff, the crust on a Pizza Hut pizza is not desirable to eat.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b599404e8fd80734e53bc158dc210f449c3a216e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/b599404e8fd80734e53bc158dc210f449c3a216e/0_0_1848_2771/667.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Brereton, opinion editor at Guardian Australia, tries meat-pie pizza.

And now, the Four’N Twenty pie crust. </p> \n<p>In retrospect, I feel like it tasted good. I am, after all, its target demographic: a dumb Generation-Y man who eats novelty garbage and loves the dregs of Australiana. Yet photographic evidence seems to imply that I did not enjoy eating it at the time. Perhaps this is the victory of Pizza Hut: turning food into a series of free-floating signifiers so detached that you remember the novelty pie, but not the taste itself. If so, sign me up to this brave new pie-crust pizza world.</p> \n<p><strong>Emily Wilson</strong>: We could argue about the quality of the pizza – I thought the one without the brown sauce was fine – but WHAT did the meat pies add? First they were disgusting, and secondly – totally, wildly, stupidly unnecessary.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Monica Tan</strong>: Firstly I was disappointed to discover this was not a true pie-pizza union. There was no genuine union of the pie and pizza spirits.</p> \n<p>Thusly, I can only rate the two things separately. It was a very standard fast-food pizza, topped with chunks of budget, miscellaneous meat that only a first-year university student the day after an all-night bender would call delicious.</p> \n<p>The pie was worse. The crust was verging on under-cooked and the teaspoon of mince and gravy was so tasteless it felt like a token appearance.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f6e9b048a0660f75322a5f7883961a1bf911371b\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/f6e9b048a0660f75322a5f7883961a1bf911371b/612_41_1556_2334/667.jpg\" alt=\"Monica Tan, a reporter at Guardian Australia, extracts a piece from her pizza.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monica Tan, a reporter at Guardian Australia, extracts a pie from her pie-pizza pizza.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brigid Delaney for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Gabrielle Jackson</strong>: It tasted exactly like I expected it to taste: like a cheap supreme pizza with a pie tacked on to the end.

In this series, our writers answer some of the most common queries","byline":"John Bradshaw","body":"<p>Dogs don’t like cats? Maybe that should be “cats don’t like dogs”, since it’s usually the cat that ends up running away (not always, there are some wimpish dogs out there). But both statements are generally true: most <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/cats\" title=\"\">cats</a> don’t seem to have much time for dogs and dogs are usually happy to chase anything that is running away, whether that happens to be a cat or a squirrel. That’s not to say that a cat and <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/dogs\" title=\"\">dog</a> can’t make friends, or become part of each other’s extended “family” – but they would have to work at it. Or rather, we (their owners) would.</p> \n<p>The phrase “fight like cat and dog” must have some truth in it. It’s certainly been in common use for more than a century, and may be much older than that. Nowadays it’s rare to see an actual cat and an actual dog engage in anything more than a brief skirmish – so how did the phrase ever become established?</p> \n<p>Like so many aphorisms, it’s something of an anachronism. Even as recently as the 19th century, dogs and especially cats were not looked after as well as they are today. Both were allowed to roam the streets, and in considerable numbers, since there was little check on the rate at which they reproduced (apart from the grim sack/river tradition).</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>So are cats and dogs natural enemies? Well, they probably were once.</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Competition over scarce scraps of food would have led to frequent fights. A dispute between two dogs is often resolved without actual fighting, since dogs have inherited a sophisticated set of signals from their pack-dwelling ancestor, the wolf, that enables them to signal their intention to back down if they consider their opponent too fearsome. Cats, being descended from solitary predators with little need to communicate face-to-face, lack such abilities, and are generally much more circumspect than dogs when they’re deciding whether or not to join an affray. Evolution has not provided either species with any capacity to communicate with one another, so close-combat fighting is more or less inevitable when neither is prepared to run.</p> \n<p>Their styles of fighting are also completely different – cats prefer to use their sharp claws (kept that way by being pulled back into sheaths when not required), whereas dogs, who continually blunt their claws by using them for traction when running, persistently try to bring their teeth and powerful jaws into play. Both like to intimidate their opponent vocally, by barking (dog), yowling, hissing and spitting (cat) and growling (both). As a result, once a fight between the two has started, they are often long drawn-out, noisy affairs that can attract a lot of attention.</p> \n<p>So are cats and dogs natural enemies? Well, they probably were once. In terms of their relationship with mankind, cats are the interlopers. Dogs were originally domesticated by our hunter-gatherer ancestors, at least 15,000 years ago, possibly longer. Whether they were “<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/feb/16/dog-scientists-guilty-look-canine-psychology\" title=\"\">man’s best friend</a>” in those early days is anybody’s guess, but by the time cats came along they were playing a big part in our lives, hunting alongside us, guarding our houses, herding our flocks, even keeping us warm at night.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3d74a47624ee467b955a3a1d3ff155c71ee83a1e\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3d74a47624ee467b955a3a1d3ff155c71ee83a1e/0_0_2848_4268/667.jpg\" alt=\"Mummy of a cat circa 1st century AD.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mummy of a cat circa 1st century AD.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cats first started hanging around our houses about 10,000 years ago, but that was pure opportunism: at that point in (pre)history, our habit of storing food had led to the emergence of the house mouse as a serious pest. There’s little evidence for humans actually liking cats (apart from, presumably, appreciating the benefits of a mouse-free granary) for another 4,000 years, when the ancient Egyptians began to leave tangible evidence of their affection, for example, by providing elaborate burials, complete with a symbolic bowl of milk, for favoured pet cats. Prior to that, dogs would have had the upper hand for thousands of years, cared for by their owners to an extent that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/shortcuts/2014/sep/16/are-you-stressing-out-your-cat-spot-the-signs\" title=\"\">very few cats would have enjoyed</a>.</p> \n<p>No level playing field for cats, then, but what would its consequences have been? First of all, competition for edible trash might have been rather one-sided, with dogs having the upper hand when there were people about. Cats would have had to rely on their natural agility to stay out of trouble, as I witnessed when I was studying feral cats in a Turkish village. One year, the cats were everywhere, making a good living from cajoling scraps from gullible tourists (myself included). The next year, a pack of dogs was roaming the streets, and the cats seemed to have vanished – or so I thought until I was able to survey the village from high up, and saw that the cats had simply moved up on to the mainly flat roofs, and were presumably venturing down to scavenge for food at night, when the dogs were asleep.</p> \n<p>More seriously (and skip this bit if you’re of a sensitive disposition), dogs would have presented a significant risk to kittens. Mother cats have to leave their nests to go hunting, and a starving dog is not fussy about what it eats. Cats would therefore have done their best not just to hide their kittens as securely as possible, but also to instil as much fear as possible into the neighbourhood dogs.</p> \n<p>Thus cats and dogs carry a grim evolutionary backstory, one that even today they have not entirely shaken off. Dogs still chase cats, and given the right motivation, cats will turn and try to fight them off.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUHBDnf5mF8\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QUHBDnf5mF8?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The good news is that such enmity is far from inevitable, given the way that dogs and cats alike learn the difference between friend and foe. This is part – and possibly no more than a side-effect – of the way that domestication has changed the way their brains develop. Puppy and kitten alike go through what’s called a “socialisation period”, when they learn not only who their mothers are, and how to behave towards other members of their own species, but also that humans are not to be feared. It’s only lack of (gentle) contact with people during the formative first couple of months of their lives that drives feral cats (and dogs) to develop a life-long distrust of humans.</p> \n<p>It’s quite straightforward to hijack this process so that a dog is included in a kitten’s list of good company, and vice versa for a puppy. You’ll need a dog-friendly cat for the latter, or a cat-friendly dog for the former. Simply being around the other species, with no unpleasant consequences, during the sensitive period (4-8 weeks for kittens, 5-12 weeks for puppies) is usually enough. I’ve kept dogs and cats together all my life without there being any adverse consequences for either, and some have become best friends – I’ll never forget the sight of two kittens, brother and sister, jockeying for position to snuggle up against my labrador.</p> \n<p>Unfortunately, once a cat has decided that it hates dogs, or a dog has come to enjoy chasing every cat it sees (ex-racing greyhounds especially), these habits are going to take a lot of very patient training to reverse.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> For more information, see <a href=\"http://www.apbc.org.uk/blog/cat_dog_introduction\" title=\"\">here</a></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"04d4922b0409b51578996920e2f41decc90b4acd\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/04d4922b0409b51578996920e2f41decc90b4acd/60_131_3480_1564/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"449\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stele depicting a fight between a dog and a cat in 510BC, from the Kerameikos necropolis in Athens, Greece.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G Nimatallah/De Agostini/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/83535f6b21b665353462752cf2c101506738cf6b/0_0_4928_2955/4928.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2955,"width":4928,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"/Getty Images/Moment Open","altText":"Dog and cat together on bed","cleanCredit":"Photograph: /Getty Images/Moment Open"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3d74a47624ee467b955a3a1d3ff155c71ee83a1e/0_0_2848_4268/2848.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4268,"width":2848,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Mummy of a cat circa 1st century AD.

Both those medals were offered for auction by descendants and sold for almost $400,000.</p> \n<p>Laura Yntema, auction manager for Nate D Sanders Auctions, said research by the company found Lederman’s medal was only the second to be auctioned while the winner was still alive.</p> \n<p>Yntema said: “It would just be an honour to own it. What these people have accomplished, it’s mindboggling how they advanced society.”</p> \n<p>Lederman’s wife, Ellen, said they had enjoyed having the medal. “It’s really a wonderful thing. But it’s not really anything we need in our log cabin,” she said. <br /></p> \n<p>For Leon Lederman, at 92, the details of the work that went into discovering a subatomic particle have become hazy over the decades. “I don’t have any real stories to tell about it,” he said. “I sit on my deck and look at the mountains.”</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5b4e9718f84802abb55567da2169759a7584f6f8/59_289_2861_1717/2861.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1717,"width":2861,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Aynsley Floyd/AP","altText":"FILE - In this Feb. 27, 2002, file photo, Physics Nobel Prize winner Dr. Leon M.

Mexican jays are cooperative breeders where several subadults help tend the nestlings produced by the dominant pair in the group. Most of these helpers are offspring of the dominant pair from earlier years, but unrelated individuals will also join a group and help raise the young. Although Mexican jays are omnivorous, they do cache acorns and nuts throughout the late summer and autumn that serve as their primary food during the winter.</p> \n<p>The research team studied nine such groups of Mexican jays living on the arid eastern slopes of the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona. These birds are individually colour-banded and have been trained to approach their own particular feeding arena in response to the sound of a police whistle. Sunflower seeds, acorns and peanuts are provided at each feeding arena that the birds can carry away and cache nearby. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abc4accf920ec05b35166fed64b1248e103ffd6d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432655170971/4b4d0128-3da0-4bd2-93ab-027d990125e3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"MexicanJayMaciejFuszara\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Mexican jay, <em>Aphelocoma wollweberi</em>, appears to evaluate the content of a peanut by weighing it in its beak and by listening to the sound created when clicking its beak on the pod.

To do this, they gave the jays 20 similarly-sized peanuts, ten of which had been emptied of nutmeats and the pods superglued closed, whilst the other ten had been opened, the nutmeats glued to the pod interior to prevent rattling, and their pods superglued closed. In this experiment, the “normal” peanuts were 4 times heavier than the empty peanuts.</p> \n<p>Second, the team tested whether the jays could distinguish between similarly-sized peanuts with a normal mass or with a slightly heavier mass than normal. To do this, they provided the birds with 20 similarly-sized peanuts that had been weighed. Ten of these peanuts were of “normal” mass and had been opened, the nutmeats glued to the pod interior and superglued closed, and ten peanuts were 1.6 times (1 gram) heavier than “normal”. The heavy peanuts were prepared by putting non-toxic clay inside each pod before they were superglued closed.</p> \n<p>Third, the team tested whether the jays chose peanuts visually based solely on size. They provided the jays with 20 peanuts, ten of which were small, containing only a single nutmeat, and ten of which were large, containing three nutmeats. As before, the team opened each peanut, glued the nutmeat to the pod interior and superglued the pods closed. But before resealing the pods of the “triple” peanuts, they removed two of the three nutmeats so all peanuts, regardless of size, had similar masses.</p> \n<h2>Slow motion videos revealed how the birds handled peanuts</h2> \n<p>The team filmed the jays with a portable high-speed camera (250 frames per second, and occasionally 500 or 1000 fps) to capture minuscule details of how the birds handled peanuts. The team later analysed the films to identify whether (and by how much) the birds opened and closed their beaks when handling a peanut, and estimated the velocity of the beak when it closed on the peanut pod.</p> \n<p>The videos revealed that the jays evaluated each peanut whilst handling it by using very fast beak and head movements. In the first and second experiments, the birds consistently chose heavier peanuts. When provided peanuts that were obviously different in size, as in the third experiment, the jays handled the larger peanuts before rejecting them and choosing the smaller peanuts.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXZyHJugzmY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IXZyHJugzmY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Mexican jays choosing the most nutritious peanuts. (doi:10.1007/s10336-015-1193-6)\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“The jays figured out that the larger pods did not weigh as much as they should and the birds preferred the smaller pods, which weighed as expected for their size”, said the study’s co-author Elzbieta Fuszara, a biologist at the <a href=\"http://en.uw.edu.pl/\">University of Warsaw</a>, in a press release. She added; basically, the birds behaved as if they knew that “something is wrong” with the larger nuts.</p> \n<h2>Birds listen to sounds created by clicking their beaks on a peanut</h2> \n<p>Preliminary analyses of the data suggest an alternative explanation for how the jays decided which peanut to cache.</p> \n<p>“Although the peanuts in our experiments had similar mass and look, they produce different sounds during handling”, write the authors in their paper. Further, despite gluing the nutmeats inside the pods to prevent them rattling, the birds created sounds by rapidly clicking their beaks on the peanuts.</p> \n<p>“If heavy/full peanuts have consistently different auditory features than light/empty ones, then the Jays would also reject the artificially lighter triple peanuts, if they follow only the auditory cues without any cognitive processes about the match between weight and visual size.”</p> \n<p>In short, birds choose the best seeds and nuts to store away for a snowy day by using the same sensory cues used by melon-thumping humans in a supermarket.</p> \n<h2>Source:</h2> \n<p>Piotr G.
