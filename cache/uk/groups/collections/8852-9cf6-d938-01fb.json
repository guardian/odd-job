The recent introduction of hot desking, following the council’s move to new premises, is taking its toll on already stretched workers. More are coming in earlier to secure a desk for the day. I find this time of day is useful to catch up on outstanding paperwork and read reports. The imminent arrival of Ofsted is on everyone’s minds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"c8e4d98ef5e22b9bbaa0ca74c55cf3fc5a527a0b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435593576767/5358bf44-71f7-4c57-9315-61e2d20bdb0f-460x442.jpeg\" alt=\"Beverly Lamb\" width=\"460\" height=\"442\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Beverly Lamb, a senior social worker.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bev Lamb</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> </p> \n<p>My first appointment is a short car journey into Manchester to attend court for a final hearing in an adoption case with a student who is shadowing me. Although it is listed for a full day, it concludes by lunchtime. The judge finds the local authority has fulfilled its obligations to support parents with learning difficulties with a joint approach from both children and adult services, and it is commended on this. I feel empathy for the parents and sadness that their child will not remain in their care, but I am happy in knowing the child will be placed with a “forever family” very soon. <br /></p> \n<p>As the case finishes early, I do an unplanned visit to a family on the way back from court. A child in need plan is in place but the mother is happy to see me because we have forged a good relationship over the previous 12 months. We discuss the possible closure of the case though the mother has mixed emotions, saying she will miss me coming, also referring to me as her “second mother”. The family have made excellent progress though and professionals agree on case closure. I feel lucky to have a good relationship with the majority of my clients and many still ring me years later for advice or to call at the office for a coffee.<br /></p> \n<p>Lunch, which is a rarity, is on the go and consists of a banana and a bottle of water, before doing a visit to undertake a risk assessment of a serious domestic abuse perpetrator. He has assaulted his new partner several times so child protection procedures have been initiated and plans put in place. Both mother and partner want to remain in a relationship and have asked for help with their relationship difficulties. Even though most of the abuse has not taken place in the presence of the children, research highlights the impact on children’s emotional welfare whether present or not. The plan highlights areas of concern and what support is needed to address them. I allocate two hours to do this and plan to follow up with another two visits. There is initial resistance from the partner as it evokes some deep emotions from his own childhood. The visit runs by an hour as a result.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/social-care-network/2015/jun/26/i-help-deafblind-people-go-on-the-holidays-theyve-always-wanted\">I help deafblind people go on the holidays they've always wanted</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>I arrive back at the office at 4.30pm and have a reflective discussion about the morning’s court case with my student; given its importance in dealing with parents who have learning disabilities.</p> \n<p>I am then ambushed by several newly qualified staff wanting advice on cases. I agree to see them one at a time. We have five newly qualified staff on the team, of whom I supervise four, alongside more experienced staff. Issues include decision-making for current court cases to requesting financial assistance for families in need and the completion of their on-the-job training programme. I arrange to observe visits to ensure they meet the criteria to demonstrate their competencies so they can complete the programme on time.</p> \n<p>I then make a hot drink and peruse emails. The office is quiet again as most of the staff have left for the evening. I collect papers for next week’s adoption panel to read over the weekend and have a sneaky peek at the agenda; only two matches and an approval, so light reading. Sometimes there can be seven matches resulting in a lot to read. I catch up on case notes from today’s events. </p> \n<p>Finally, I email the adoption social worker to advise of the care and placement order made earlier in the day, and give the foster carer a quick call to bring her up to speed. It is now 6.30pm in the evening and following a quick look at my diary for tomorrow, I head home. </p> \n<p><em>If you would like to feature in our Day in the Life series, or know someone who would, email </em><a href=\"mailto:socialcare@theguardian.com\"><em>socialcare@theguardian.com</em></a><em>.</em></p>","section":"Social Care Network","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435749094825/d00d5600-be6c-4455-8701-e6ec80583eff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Stock Connection Distribution //Alamy","altText":"A girl sits next to a cardboard box with her doll","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Stock Connection Distribution //Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435593576187/9dfdfad5-e87e-467f-87cb-da6bbbb3f598-620x595.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":595,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Beverly Lamb, a senior social worker.

After watching this I’m none the wiser","standFirst":"What links a fatberg, the Shard’s foundations, an old oak’s roots and a potash mine? After watching this I’m none the wiser","byline":"Lucy Mangan","body":"<p>I’m not sure where to begin with a review of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0619k4f\" title=\"\"><strong>Britain Beneath Your Feet</strong></a> (BBC1). It hopped around all over the place. One minute we were looking under the Shard and asking a structural engineer to confirm that the 300m building really did need foundations 53 metres deep to keep it standing (yes, it does, because it’s standing in clay. Presenter Dallas Campbell threw a clay pot on a wheel to show us how soft clay is. Clay!). The next we were haring off to Yorkshire to look at an underground waterfall. Really, really deep underground! Waterfall! Then it was down to Bristol, then across to London to look at the rivers the cities have covered over to facilitate their sprawl. Rivers! Covered! Sprawl!</p> \n<p>A quick dash round <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/shortcuts/2015/apr/22/fatbergs-is-there-one-lurking-in-a-sewer-near-you\" title=\"\">a fatberg</a> (pause for Campbell to puke at the smell, pause for moi to puke as the accumulated mass of sewage and solidified fat broke open to show the worms that had set up home inside) and the basalt majesty of Edinburgh Castle’s unyielding home, a dip in a hot Bath spa, the circumnavigation of a 440-year-old oak tree’s root system, a quick descent into a potash mine, and back up in time for Campbell truly pointlessly to demonstrate his lack of sporting prowess in an abandoned slate mine being used by the Threlkeld cricketing team.</p> \n<p>It was, in essence, Ripley’s Believe It Or Not! Museum in televisual form. Spectacles were presented, briefly admired, and then abandoned for the next thing. There was no overarching theme – the rivers of yesteryear perhaps, or feats of engineering, which could have united the mines, the new techniques responsible for the Shard, the Gherkin et al and the fatberged sewers, or ancient features of the underground landscapes – allowing one example to illuminate another. In a programme whose very premise begged the makers to go deeper, it was immensely frustrating. Scanning the root system of an oak tree that was planted when Queen Elizabeth I was on the throne was excitement enough for me, but did you know that there’s a man in a laboratory a thousand metres down the potash mine in Boulby researching the existence of dark matter? No, nothing to do with potash. But it’s the only place where he can get far enough away from the light and radiation that keep intruding on his investigations. How can you not want to drill a bit further into that?</p> \n<p>Campbell also used “summit” as a verb. I am too hot to care any more, so I haven’t yet sent the letter demanding the requisite percentage of my licence fee back, but if it happens again next week, I shall be posting first class and no mistake.</p> \n<p>Similarly, what lies beneath Ben Winkett’s life of burglary, car crime and property damage on and around his local estate in Dudley is anyone’s guess. The 19-year-old was the focus of last night’s Channel 4 documentary <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/career-criminals\" title=\"\"><strong>Career Criminals</strong></a>. He’s not a drug user. “He uses it to fund his lifestyle”, says Stuart, part of the police team of “offender managers” who have the unenviable task of trying to stop and rehabilitate those they know are responsible for most of the area’s crime. But Ben’s lifestyle comprises mostly new trainers and McDonald’s and the suspicion is that he is stealing mostly at the behest and for the benefit of a more savvy entity. More of a reward, perhaps, is the hero status his thievery gives him among his friends.</p> \n<p>Ben is the despair of his older brother Tom, who has been in prison for six of his 26 years and knows Ben is too soft to survive his surely eventual incarceration. “He ain’t like me,” he explains. “He ain’t a fighting person. It’s no good, is it? I know what my mum felt like now.”</p> \n<p>By documentary-making standards, Ben was an unrewarding subject – unreflective, uncharismatic and, by the end of the period covered at least, unsalvageable. You felt far more for Tom, whose past caught up with him after he had apparently made a fine go of a crime-free life with a new partner, and who ended up in prison again after new evidence of a previous offence came to light.</p> \n<p>The question of how effective the force’s strategy of harassing repeat offenders until they are – what? Annoyed into going straight? Frustrated into gainful employment? – was barely posed, let alone answered. I’d like to have heard whether that should ever really have been considered a thing outside some twit-brained politician’s Bright Ideas memo pad. Yet more digging required.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435838894480/old-oak-roots----ritain-B-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"In essence, it was Ripley's Believe It Or Not!

But it remains unclear whether this equates to a lift in revenue for artists</p>","byline":"Guardian music","body":"<p>Music streaming is booming, at least in the UK. According to new data from the Official Charts Company, music streams are up 80% year on year through services such as Spotify, Deezer and Google Play. This added up to a grand total of 11.5bn streams listened to by Brits in the last six months, compared to 14.8bn for the whole of 2014. Using the Album Equivalent Sales measure, which aims to bring streaming figures in line with traditional music industry sales measurements, these figures show an overall 4% lift in music consumption.</p> \n<p> The news comes after a seismic few months for the streaming industry, with the launch of Tidal and Apple Music both threatening the dominance of Spotify. In the past few months a series of high profile musicians – from AC/DC to Taylor Swift – have been vocal about the new medium, with Swift helping to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/22/apple-music-royalties-free-trial-taylor-swift\">pressure Apple into paying artists royalties</a> during the service’s free trial period.</p> \n<p> However, while streaming figures have shot up, it’s unclear whether this equates to an increase in revenue for artists. The BPI, who released the figures, did not break down the difference between paid subscribers and those using streaming services for free. Music streams on YouTube videos, which pays a comparatively low royalty rate, have also increased by 98% year on year, which may give some in the industry cause for concern.</p> \n<p>Geoff Taylor, chief executive of the BPI, remained buoyant however. He said: “The launch of Apple Music will give further impetus to the revolution of music streaming. Millions of households are experiencing the joy of instantly playing any song they want, all around their house and on any device, and exploring a universe of new music and classic albums.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, the figures continued to show the decline of the CD, although the speed of decline was slowing, with a 4.4% drop for physical formats compared to last year’s 10.4% drop. Vinyl sales reached a 20-year high with the format on course to shift 2m units by the end of the year.</p> \n<p>The most-streamed track of the year to date was Mark Ronson’s Uptown Funk, which has been played 45 million times on streaming services so far this year.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/10/1428634913424/cb656415-ef2f-4c59-83ea-035f8b776c24-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Sony Music","altText":"AC/DC recently joined the streaming revolution.

As well as many other fantastically irritating things, they have rebooted the spelling of “genesis”. The old spelling of “genesis” is an orthographic franchise which has been reinvigorated. They’ve reimagined it. They’ve upgraded it. It’s left me in a state of paralisys. It’s crushing every brain synapsys. This is a personal crisys and I may need analisys, and the basys of all this is that Terminator Genisys is the antithisys of enjoyable.</p> \n<p>Like JJ Abrams’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2009/may/08/star-trek\">Star Trek</a>, it uses the concept of time travel to rewrite how the story starts – but with none of the freshness and wit. It is shackled to its muddled and laborious plot variants and dialogue quotes from the original, and also to a concept that I think was always sentimental and wrong-headed: the idea of Arnie’s Terminator turning into a good guy, and now aged into a cutesy-grumpy old retainer.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457315027__\n</div> \n<p>The drama shows us the backstory to what we think we know: the future rebels over-running the machines’ final stronghold in 2029, only to find the machines have sent their Terminator back in time to kill John Connor’s mum Sarah. Now it is the dull Jai Courtney playing her rescuer Kyle; the uninteresting Emilia Clarke is Sarah; Jason Clarke is on boring form as John Connor – and even 67-year-old Arnold Schwarzenegger himself is under par, playing the lovable old cyborg himself, now cloyingly known as Pops. (It’s the sound his joints make.)</p> \n<p>But things are reversed. Kyle and Sarah and adorable Pops have to terminate, at birth, the machines’ sinister all-encompassing AI programme called Genisys. (It’s an operating <em>sys</em>–tem, so I guess the annoying spelling has some point.) This idea is incidentally not unlike Anthony Horowitz’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2006/jul/21/family.comedy\">Stormbreaker</a>.

With changes in camera technology, the White House can lift the ban, according to the statement.<br /></p> \n<p>“We want guests to enjoy the People’s House. Lifting this ban will allow visitors to keep the memories of their visit to the White House for a lifetime and share them with their family and friends.”</p> \n<p>The White House still prohibits video cameras, cameras with detachable lenses and tablets, and accessories such as tripods, monopods and selfie sticks. Phone cameras and compact still cameras with a lens no longer than 3in (7.6 cm) are allowed.<br /></p> \n<p>Frank Sesno, director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at the George Washington University, said the new rule is a “terrific move on many levels.”</p> \n<p>“It’s always a good thing when the White House opens up rather than closes down,” he said. “Visitors will be able to take pictures and capture images in the White House amidst all that history and share that through their social networks. Anything that elevates awareness of government and citizenship and history in this country is a very good thing.”<br /></p> \n<p>Sesno said the move was great for citizens, but that it would not change much for journalists and advocates pushing for a more open White House.<br /></p> \n<p>“It won’t change anything, or make anything easier,” he said. “We’re concerned about the fundamentals of transparency. This is for tourists and visitors.”<br /></p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3544fea16813b2f0d2bbbfefe4fb8f77e0e0792e/0_176_3702_2223/3702.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2223,"width":3702,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Susan Walsh/AP","altText":"White house photo ban lifted","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-02T18:06:01Z","lastModified":"2015-07-03T07:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":11,"contributors":[{"name":"Mahita Gajanan","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/mahita-gajanan"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Social media","US news","Barack Obama","Michelle Obama","Privacy","Instagram","Digital media","Technology","Washington DC"],"tags":[{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media"},{"id":"us-news/us-news","webTitle":"US news"},{"id":"us-news/barack-obama","webTitle":"Barack Obama"},{"id":"us-news/michelleobama","webTitle":"Michelle Obama"},{"id":"world/privacy","webTitle":"Privacy"},{"id":"technology/instagram","webTitle":"Instagram"},{"id":"media/digital-media","webTitle":"Digital media"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"},{"id":"us-news/washington-dc","webTitle":"Washington DC"}],"section":{"id":"media"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Mahita Gajanan","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/mahita-gajanan"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/02/white-house-tour-photos-social-media","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4abdc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/2015/jul/02/white-house-tour-photos-social-media","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/jul/02/white-house-tour-photos-social-media"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/3544fea16813b2f0d2bbbfefe4fb8f77e0e0792e/0_176_3702_2223/3702.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2223,"width":3702,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"People take photos while touring the White House in Washington on Wednesday.
