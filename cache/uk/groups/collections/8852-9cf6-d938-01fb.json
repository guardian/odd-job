Wherever their alienation springs from – a sense of marginalisation, lack of formal chops, some deeper source – it often reflects in their art, which comes across to more privileged, more schooled “straights” as raw, untutored, or hard to process; an acquired taste.</p> \n<p>Ezra Furman is not like that. The 28-year-old Chicago-born singer, on his third solo album and the cusp of renown, is, bluntly, an observant rock’n’roll Jew who cross-dresses; he identifies as bisexual and has a history of depression. He struggles with all of it – audibly, joyously, angrily, movingly. His last album, 2013’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2013/dec/05/ezra-furman-day-dog-review\" title=\"\"><em>Day of the Dog</em></a>, garnered acclaim, at least on this side of the Atlantic, paving the way for this album’s big step up.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2014/sep/11/ezra-furman-outcasts-chuck-berry-judaism\">Ezra Furman on outcasts, Chuck Berry and Judaism</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Unlike most margin-dwelling soundtracks, however, the churn of <em>Perpetual Motion People</em> is easy on the ear. Furman’s approach is scattershot, but catholic: jangly punk rock (such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8qqSEhd7iA\" title=\"\">Hark! to the Music</a>), the Velvet Underground, saxophones, Jonathan Richman, old spirituals (One Day I Will Sin No More), country, the E Street Band. They aren’t particularly fashionable, but <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QeJODSjIbT8\" title=\"\">Violent Femmes</a> are Furman’s spiritual and material forebears, struggling as they did with society, hormones and God through the medium of ragged country-punk.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDOenFQazrA\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NDOenFQazrA?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Ezra Furman’s Restless Year.\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Crucially, though, Furman’s dislocation doesn’t come out as unlistenable angst. It comes out as tunes – roustabout, copper-bottomed, sticky things. From <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDOenFQazrA\" title=\"\">Restless Year</a>, which crystallises Furman’s inability to feel at home anywhere, to One Day I Will Sin No More, the closing track dealing with Furman’s faith, you can hum them all. That’s 13 songs, with 13 nagging hooks and 13 singalong choruses; no mean feat in any genre, let alone a few.</p> \n<p>Last album around, I mistook Furman’s quirky, derivative accessibility for lack of depth. The very title of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahqKl8bbsoE\" title=\"\">I Wanna Destroy Myself</a>, for one, packed in all the cliched rock’n’roll tropes from Iggy and the Stooges to Kurt Cobain. Now, songs such as Restless Year just sound increasingly great, rather than ersatz, and I listen to Furman cook an egg on Haunted Head and well up (“I get a slice of bread/I cut a hole in it/I crack a little an egg into it/Frying pan/And I try to get my mind turned off...”).</p> \n<p>It is easy to get fed up with whining indie balladeers playing at outsider-dom. But <em>Perpetual Motion People</em> confirms Furman as no mere white male navel-gazer, but flammable phosphorus: “If you feel like the tip of a match/Then strike!” goes Tip of a Match. The feel here is reckless, with Furman seeking shelter on Can I Sleep in Your Brain?, or comfort in the staid doo-wop of Pot Holes. As a result, Furman is going to have a new struggle on his hands: with recognition.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435949747627/653d7739-13c3-480b-89b0-abc0cead5b74-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Phil Sharp","altText":"Ezra Furman: 'no mere white male navel-gazer'. \r\n","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Phil Sharp"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-05T07:59:08Z","lastModified":"2015-07-05T07:59:08Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Kitty Empire","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733741803/KittyEmpire.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/kittyempire"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Indie","Music","Culture"],"tags":[{"id":"music/indie","webTitle":"Indie"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Kitty Empire","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/kittyempire"}}],"starRating":"4","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jul/05/ezra-furman-perpetual-motion-people-review-outsider-not-acquired-taste","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a96p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jul/05/ezra-furman-perpetual-motion-people-review-outsider-not-acquired-taste","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/05/ezra-furman-perpetual-motion-people-review-outsider-not-acquired-taste"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435949747627/653d7739-13c3-480b-89b0-abc0cead5b74-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ezra Furman: ‘no mere white male navel-gazer’.","credit":"Phil Sharp","altText":"Ezra Furman: 'no mere white male navel-gazer'. \r\n","cleanCaption":"Ezra Furman: ‘no mere white male navel-gazer’."}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Ezra Furman review"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435949747627/653d7739-13c3-480b-89b0-abc0cead5b74-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Phil Sharp","altText":"Ezra Furman: 'no mere white male navel-gazer'. \r\n","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Phil Sharp"}}]},{"title":"Electric spark / Tesla S: car review","rawTitle":"Tesla S: car review","item":{"type":"article","id":"technology/2015/jul/05/tesla-s-car-review-martin-love","title":"Tesla S: car review","trailText":"The electric Tesla S is a pure spark of inspiration.

I drove the <a href=\"http://www.teslamotors.com/en_GB/models\">Tesla S</a> last week and it offers such revolutionary solutions to so many of the oily problems that bog most manufacturers down that you wonder what on earth they’ve all been doing. While they’ve been dozing, <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/technology/elon-musk\">Elon Musk</a>, the polymath gigabillionaire who invented <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/uk/home\">PayPal</a>, has set about changing the cars we drive – and the way we drive them.</p> \n<p>From the outside, the Tesla S is fairly unremarkable. It looks like a posh Jag or maybe a nice Lexus. In a corporate car park a Tesla is just another anonymous fatcat motor. It’s under that boring skin that the fun begins. First up, ask your kids where they think the engine is. They’ll point at that long bonnet. Pop it open by squeezing the fob in your pocket (the key is shaped like a tiny Tesla). The kids will peer into the empty cavity and see only decent storage. Ha, they know your game. It’s round the back. You pop the lid on the boot… Nope, just more storage. “Holy shit!” They cry, “<em>There’s no engine</em>!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3c519751319233a35997e8d339e5a3914efcb44\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661945492/e6a0052f-d728-4da1-94a3-0afb3c759374-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The world at your finger tip: the 17in touchscreen interface dominates the inside of the car\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The world at your fingertip: the 17in touchscreen interface dominates the inside of the car</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In fact there is: it’s the size of a handbag and is hidden behind the back seat, but they don’t need to know that. A giant battery pack powers this handbag and it takes up the entire floor of the car. Some have said a Tesla is not so much a car as a battery on wheels. It’s this smart battery that blasts you to a top speed of 140mph and gives you a range of 240 miles.</p> \n<p>The car doesn’t have a fuel tank, exhaust pipes, petrol cap or any of the other gubbins associated with an internal combustion engine. Being purely electric it only has one gear. Hit the throttle and the car accelerates in a soaring, totally silent, endless swoosh – it essentially does 0-140mph in first. It also doesn’t have an ignition. There is no on or off. The car wakes up when you approach it (it detects that tiny Tesla in your pocket). You get in, select D, press the throttle and off you slip. When you stop, you just get out and walk away.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70e5fcaa64b9580bff33017955dd2c80c42b40ae\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435662082957/3625f66e-0deb-408f-8191-51c4a898188b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Plugged in: the fully charged Tesla S has a range of about 240 miles.

It doesn’t free wheel at all. But after a while you’ll find you hardly use the brakes. Under acceleration its ability to pick up speed is astonishing and it handles corners just as you would expect a premium performance car to do.</p> \n<p>Inside, the car is lavish, but it’s quite normal. The only giveaway to its futuristic credentials is the driver interface – a gigantic multimedia screen. You control everything using this. It’s also a TV, a computer and a music system.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9e36db2da78080a3ab1bafb38bc0443be7abf64\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435662182234/bbf8a239-3c36-46c4-bd12-1a9f89be2fd3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Open road: the all-electric car has superb handling.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Open road: the all-electric car has superb handling</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You can stay in touch with your Tesla using an app on your phone. Sitting at my desk, now, I can see the car is parked outside my home seven miles away. Its interior temperature is 21C. I could open the sunroof or flash the lights with a tap on my phone screen. Actually, I just honked the horn. That’ll make the dog bark – wife annoyed, tick! You can sync the car to your online diary, too, so if you have a 2.30pm meeting in Reading, the car will contact you and tell you when it’s time to leave.</p> \n<p>The only real issue is charging. When you buy a Tesla they install a supercharger in your garage. It then takes four hours to fully charge. Using a domestic plug, it only recharges at six miles per hour. There is an ever-expanding network of superchargers spreading across Europe and these are free for Tesla owners. If you want to drive to the south of France, the car will plot a route via the charge points you’ll need to visit. But what if the battery is flat, your kid has an accident and you have to suddenly drive to hospital? Tough, you can’t.

Early in the week, Radio 4 revealed the highlights of its new radio season (Lauren Laverne doing a series of <em>Late Night Woman’s Hour</em> shows with Jane Garvey; Glenda Jackson returning to acting in a Zola adaptation: great). The next day, <em>Woman’s Hour</em> published its <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/1wsc6xjTph1CvN5jWzLtfzT/womans-hour-2015-power-list-influencers\" title=\"\">influence list</a> (top three: Nicola Sturgeon, Anna Wintour, Angelina Jolie). And then, on Thursday, we were told the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/jul/02/bbc-cut-more-1000-jobs-cost-saving-push\" title=\"\">BBC would be shedding more than 1,000 jobs</a>. Everyone seems resigned to the government getting rid of the licence fee, so it’s chopping early.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, riding high as always on its hog of Shiny Stuff We Don’t Actually Need, Apple launched <a href=\"http://applemusic.tumblr.com/beats1\" title=\"\"><strong>Beats 1</strong></a> radio on Tuesday night, an internet station that you access via iTunes. Its star presenters are Zane Lowe, Julie Adenuga and Ebro Darden, all of whom are excellent. Still, under the circumstances, it’s a little odd to hear how much Beats 1 has ripped from the BBC. The production values are Radio 1 (Zane took a couple of producers with him); the guest presenters are musicians such as Josh Homme, a very 6 Music touch; and the playlist itself is 1/1Xtra/6. And there’s even a feature called Headphone Moment – a staple of Lauren Laverne’s 6 Music show.</p> \n<p>Adenuga is my favourite: she plays the music I like and she’s a lovely, upbeat listening presence. (I wonder if the BBC tried to tempt her away from Rinse FM before Apple did?) Her show is mostly music, but she also has interviews, which are much shorter than you might expect, probably because the interviewees are unlikely to be known by Americans. So on Wednesday night’s show (repeated on Thursday morning), Adenuga talked to singer <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/24/lianne-la-havas-review-from-purple-protegee-tomorrows-transatlantic-star\" title=\"\">Lianne La Havas</a>, Mancunian MC/DJ crew LVLZ and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2013/sep/01/jamal-edwards-on-my-radar\" title=\"\">Jamal Edwards</a>, main man of SBTV. People might just about have heard of La Havas and Edwards, but the daft and multifarious LEVELZ are still quite underground. Adenuga tried to get them to explain the difference between Manchester and London. “It’s a rainy place… There’s not as many suits… It’s proper flourishing…”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"59cb269eb3b557798662d1fa770e0b6592bd7318\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435917519515/5946cc2a-c1f1-433f-9b27-af0d290521a3-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Hardeep Singh Kohli\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hardeep Singh Kohli, presenter of Crisis in the Curry Kitchen.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Features</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On Apple, there’s a lot of emphasis on how the world is listening and I like the idea of Adenuga blasting grime across the planet, of the world getting down to Stormzy and JME. Plus, she’s up for a wider range of British music, spinning one of my new favourites from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/29/la-priest-samuel-dust\" title=\"\">LA Priest</a>, so hooray to that. But you know what? All those listeners across the world could be hearing that music already on the BBC for nothing if they listened live. Also, Apple is strange about schedules, DJs and tracklisting, making them all ridiculously hard to find. You have to go to a Tumblr account for the schedule, and it doesn’t list everyone. So Becca D, aka Becca Dudley, is busy doing her stuff for Beats LDN, but she doesn’t get an online picture or a namecheck. And a non-affiliated Twitter account, @Beats1plays, has started listing all the music that’s going out there, because Beats 1 itself doesn’t do it.</p> \n<p>At its worst, Beats 1 is mainstream, a slightly better Kiss FM. But at its best, Adenuga and co are the real deal. If they get more time to talk, as well as play, if they’re allowed to turn Beats 1 into an actual radio station, rather than a series of well-curated shows punctuated by Maccy D ads, then Apple will truly be taking on and taking&nbsp;over the best of the BBC. And the BBC won’t have the money to put up a fight.</p> \n<p>Over on Radio 4, the new series of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0608nxv\" title=\"\"><strong>Bunk Bed</strong></a><strong> </strong>is up and running. What a funny – ha ha and peculiar – show this is. Peter Curran and Patrick Marber lie in their beds and chat about stuff for 15 minutes. That’s it. It makes me laugh a lot. It’s their little hmms and mmms, the pauses between subjects, the deadpan delivery. And the topics. Last week we had whether celebrities have changed the way they wave for photographs, why Curran got a beating with a wooden spoon from his mammy… Though it seems casual, there’s clearly a lot of thought behind it, particularly from Curran. Last week he played Marber some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzmXQY0l5Xs\" title=\"\">Napalm Death</a>.

There are specialist academic and apprentice institutions – curry colleges – but it’s proving difficult to get people to sign up.

But after this London visit I was subsequently offered one drink/cake voucher, one for free glasses lenses to be used only at Westfield (I don’t wear glasses), and a voucher for a free glass of fizz with a pizza in the Oxford Street store (I don’t like pizza). I was also offered a &pound;5 voucher if I spend more than &pound;50, but which had to be activated in such a way that I lost the will to live. </strong></p> \n<p><strong>I have queried with customer services, customer relations and even managing director Andy Street how the data gleaned from my card worked out that these largely London-centred vouchers would be useful, but all the rather hazy replies lead me to think they don’t know either. </strong></p> \n<p><strong>I feel a badly run loyalty card system is worse than no card at all.

But this scheme is voluntary.</p> \n<p>Obviously, it has slightly backfired in your case. John Lewis said all its rewards are tailored on a variety of factors including shopping frequency, spend, preferences and purchases. “We look at where members most shop, as well as where they last shopped,” it said. “As our system recognised that J O’K occasionally visits our London shops we wanted to add these vouchers to her reward package as a further benefit. These offers were additional vouchers alongside a hot drink and cake voucher which could be used at any shop.</p> \n<p>“Through my John Lewis, customers receive a variety of rewards and a hot drink and cake is just one – other rewards are invitations to exclusive events, previews of new collections, incentives, and a monthly prize draw.”</p> \n<p>Back to your specific case, and John Lewis insisted it was never its intention to cause disappointment when sending rewards to customers. As well as a detailed explanation of how the process works, it has offered you an additional hot drink and cake voucher for two as a gesture of goodwill.</p> \n<p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Dan is smitten…<br /></p>","byline":"Dan Pearson","body":"<p>Five years ago, in the strenuous few months between making an offer on the farm and selling the house in Peckham, I bought a collection of <em>Lilium martagon</em>. It was a dare to myself because with the commitment came risk. I had too many bulbs to squeeze into the London garden and their potential home in Somerset was still in the lap of the gods.</p> \n<p>Thankfully, the gods came good and so did the lilies. I knew <em>Lilium martagon</em> well in its dusky mauve form, which I had first seen naturalised at Sissinghurst. As a teenager I was already obsessed and dreamed of having them myself one day, but my commitment to do so was cemented when I initially saw them growing in the wild. I was on my first plant-hunting trip to the Pyrenees and came upon them where nut wood thinned to meadow. They were growing in the exact same combination as at <a href=\"http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/sissinghurst-castle-garden/\">Sissinghurst</a>, reaching up through pale astrantia.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b413a73de1c87256e9feaa0bdee67391e44821f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673307453/68bd24e6-ef0d-49ff-8ac0-78cc3d53f034-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"'Port Wine', with apt colouring.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Port Wine’, with apt colouring.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I imagined then that <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/vita-sackville-west\">Vita Sackville-West</a> had seen them in just the same way, on one of her European trips, but recently heard it was her gardeners, Pam and Sibylle, who had added this layer to the garden. Happy in the cool, north-facing slopes of the Delos garden, they had established a niche in cultivation.</p> \n<p>The Turk’s cap lily gets its name from reflexed petals that scroll back from downward facing buds. In the “true” form they reveal a paler mauve throat, speckled with darker spots. Green stamens push from below with rust-orange anthers. The pollen of all lilies (and their close allies the <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/advice/profile?pid=115\">hemerocallis</a>) is poisonous to cats and it will also stain clothing, but it is sacrilege to de-anther them. Far better to plant them out of reach – but not so far out of reach that you can’t easily squish lily beetles and their grubs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"93afdf0e06bfdca574a7e28cc436ad65dcacb230\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673382565/16100243-9671-42cb-87c5-d97350776259-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Hanson lily.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Hanson lily.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Of the moving-in collection, I have let ‘Marmalade’ go. The petals do not reflex sufficiently and part of the joy of a Turk’s cap is that they do. I have become smitten by ‘Claude Shride’, with its dark mahogany-red flowers. We tried to use this wonderful plant at Chelsea this year, but had to substitute at the last minute with ‘Maroon King’, the rose-red ‘Slate’s Select’ and the saffron <em>Lilium hansonii</em>. I was also able to extend my collection from <a href=\"http://www.hwhyde.co.uk/\">HW Hyde and Son</a>, who were exhibiting ‘Port Wine’ with apt colouring, ‘Gaybird’ a soft red, ‘Purple Ozelot’, a dull mauve and the softly speckled ‘Mrs RO Backhouse’.</p> \n<p><em>Lilium martagon</em> is happy to naturalise in open grass, where it grows thin among trees. They will also self-seed alongside low perennials in dappled shade where the soil is open but moisture retentive. The seed is easily germinated, but be patient as it will take five years or so to flower. Some years from now I hope to have them naturalising here in shades of cream through orange to deepest red. It is a dream, of course, but one that I am happy to hold out for.</p> \n<h2>Get growing</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5587cd2b5feba18303fb3ee426fc9eab5e7a1aec\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435672989606/7a7575e9-b6c7-4b1a-ada5-1e528bcbab0e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bright red lily beetle on a leaf\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lily beetle on a leaf.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Order now and plant lilies in the autumn with a handful of sharp grit around the bulb to protect them from slugs and no more than an outstretched arm from a path so that it is easy to squash the scarlet lily beetle and its grubs </p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435672806861/Turks-cap-lily-Lilium-mar-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hats off: Lilium martagon ‘Claude Shride’.

We look at the relative costs and ethics on the types of nappies available","byline":"Lily Canter","body":"<p>The average baby gets through 4,000 disposable nappies by the time they’re potty-trained, costing families &pound;400 a year and creating the equivalent of half a tonne of carbon dioxide.</p> \n<p>Most toddlers are out of nappies – during the day, at least – by the time they’re two-and-a-half, by which point parents will have spent &pound;1,000-plus on disposable nappies and upwards of &pound;250 on the associated paraphernalia such as baby wipes, nappy bags and nappy bins.</p> \n<p>These figures, from an Environment Agency study and consumer group Which?, may be enough to prompt parents to consider opting for reusable nappies instead. The <a href=\"http://goreal.org.uk\">reusable nappy information service Go Real</a> claims parents can save at least &pound;150 by switching away from disposables, with parents who go for the cheapest renewable brands able to save a lot more. And then there are the environmental benefits: experts claim disposable nappies take up to 500 years to break down.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3bcb11e1e72de2f02e1edff74a2be28a520a5903\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435760354499/65ee559b-2d12-44b0-bb65-2fd889a51ebf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"babies in disposable nappies\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Disposable nappies are convenient but last up to 500 years in landfill.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ace Stock Limited/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Reusable nappies involve set-up costs, but while you can spend hundreds of pounds on kit, you don’t have to. Go Real reckons &pound;80 will cover a pack of 20 of the cheapest reusable nappies and three waterproof wraps. Along with the cost of washing, it says the first year’s cost can be as low as &pound;132.</p> \n<p>By contrast, recent research by MoneySavingExpert found that <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/shopping/cheap-nappies\">using branded disposable nappies costs an average of &pound;970 over 24 months</a>, while own-brand nappies can cost &pound;750.</p> \n<p>But the decision to use disposables is not just about cost, says Rachel Burrows of UK parenting website <a href=\"http://www.netmums.com/\">Netmums</a>. “Parents also factor in convenience, time and environmental ethics before deciding which works best for their family,” she says. “More parents are beginning to combine cloth and disposable, using disposables when their baby is out and cloth nappies at home where they are easier to clean.”</p> \n<p>Burrows says that while cloth nappies are a lot more expensive to buy, they can save significant amounts of money if they are reused for later children. But parents must factor in laundry costs, which can range from a few pounds a week at home to &pound;15 a week for a professional nappy laundering service.</p> \n<p>Electricity and water bills also need to be taken into account. The Energy Saving Trust estimates that a 30C wash costs an average of 15p a cycle for water and 4p for electricity. As you turn up the heat, the cost of electricity rises: a 90C wash will cost 15p. Tumble drying costs a further 21p for each cycle.</p> \n<p>However, many local councils offer incentives such as free trials, laundry services and cashback on reusable nappy purchases.</p> \n<p>Guardian Money spoke to two mothers and discovered there were considerable savings to be had, even when mixing reuseables with disposables.</p> \n<p><strong>Michelle: &pound;575.56 per child</strong></p> \n<p>Michelle Rankin, 36, is mother of three sons – Thane, six; Harris, four; and Lennox, three. They live in Bromley, Greater London.</p> \n<p>The decision to use reusable nappies was an obvious choice, Rankin says. “From the very beginning I decided I didn’t want to be filling up landfill with nappies. I got the whole pack and actually ended up using them for all three children.”</p> \n<p>The set-up cost was around &pound;500 for 38 reusable nappies and parts, but Rankin is convinced that overall they were far cheaper than disposables, even though she used more expensive <a href=\"https://www.waterwipes.com/\">WaterWipes</a> (&pound;25 per calendar quarter). She also managed to recoup &pound;80 when she resold the nappies online.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I got the whole pack and ended up using them for all three children</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Michelle Rankin</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Rankin used 26 <a href=\"https://www.earthlets.com/Brands/Mother-ease?gclid=CPeuodWrvMYCFcvItAodLQgC6A\">Motherease</a> pre-folded popper-fastening nappies with an outer wrap and inner liner, which she bought in bulk for &pound;15 each, including all three parts. She also bought 12 of the cheaper terry towelling nappies and rubber pants for around &pound;10 each, plus &pound;6 for a pack of five crocodile clips.</p> \n<p>The liners and nappies were washed together twice a week on average, on a 70C wash. The nappies were then line-dried, apart from the terry ones which would be given 10 minutes in the tumble dryer to avoid them becoming “cardboard-like”.</p> \n<p>Rankin says there were occasions when it was necessary to use disposable nappies.“The only time I used disposable nappies was at night, as reusables were not as nice on the skin all night. I also used disposables when we were travelling up to Scotland to see my mum.”</p> \n<p>With her oldest child being out of nappies at 18 months and the other two at around two years, Rankin’s largest outlay was not on energy but on wipes and washing products.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Total estimated cost for three children from birth to potty trained (total of 5.5 years): &pound;1,726.68, giving an average cost per child of &pound;575.56.</p> \n<p>Made up of: reusable nappies &pound;436 (including &pound;80 resale cost); disposable nappies &pound;200.75; wipes &pound;550; washing products &pound;360.08 (based on two washes a week); electricity &pound;85.80 (washing and tumble drying); water &pound;94.05.</p> \n<p><strong>Sarah: &pound;698.59 per child</strong></p> \n<p>Sarah*, 27, is mother of 15-month-old Theodore, from Kettering, Northamptonshire. A self-confessed “flitter” between reusable and disposable nappies, Sarah did not start using reusables until her son was six months old, and reverts to disposables in the winter or while on holiday. She uses <a href=\"https://www.aldi.co.uk/en/product-range/baby-toddler/award-winning-mamia-nappies-wipes/\">Aldi’s Mamia nappies</a>, which average 8p a nappy.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78b6c3ec32015c4c134a6c75aa4a5746757e5529\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435760144377/8d194575-0e01-44a1-bcfc-8bee5e8c2341-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"baby in reusable nappy\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reusable nappies involve a big outlay at first, but can ensure large savings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Cook/blueshiftstudios//Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The pretty designs and comfortable fit of reusable nappies are the continued draw for Sarah now that she has ditched the disposables.</p> \n<p>“My mum used cloth nappies with me and my two siblings. We had the terry ones with the pins. I thought I would give it a go, with the idea of saving money.”</p> \n<p>Sarah signed up to a free cloth nappy trial with Kettering borough council, which meant she had a range of different brands to try before purchasing her own. She also received a &pound;25 rebate from the council for buying reusable nappies.</p> \n<p>Sarah started with <a href=\"http://www.gnappies.com/\">gNappies</a> (nappy covers that you use with biodegradable disposable inserts) during the day and <a href=\"http://www.littlelambnappies.com/\">Littlelamb</a> cloth nappies at night, but soon found they did not suit her. They cost her &pound;50. She briefly tried rewashable wipes but found them “more trouble than they are worth”, and now uses Pampers disposable wipes (&pound;40 a year).</p> \n<p>The gNappies include cloth pants, waterproof pouch and insert, all of which are machine-washable. Sarah spent around &pound;140 on the gNappies pants, &pound;28 on pouches and &pound;30 on inserts. She also has four washable nappy bags for the wet and soiled parts, costing &pound;16 altogether.</p> \n<p>The pants and pouches are washed with normal loads, while Sarah washes the inserts about three times a week at 60C and once a month at 90C. These are then line-dried. She hopes to use reusable nappies when she has a second child, but thinks she will not start until he or she is around six months old, due to the quantity of nappies newborn babies go through, and the convenience of disposables.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Total estimated cost for one child from birth to potty trained (assuming potty trained at 30 months): &pound;698.59.</p> \n<p>Made up of: reusable nappies &pound;223 (including council rebate); disposable nappies &pound;167; wipes &pound;100; washing products &pound;145.99 (based on three washes a week); electricity &pound;27.70; water &pound;34.90.
