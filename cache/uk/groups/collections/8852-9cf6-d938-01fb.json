But they may have been trying to pull the wool over our eyes ...</p>","byline":"Tim Dowling","body":"<p>Film-maker Dan Vernon spent seven months filming and getting to know members of the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, a branch of the white supremacist organisation, headquartered in Missouri, which claims to reject violence and hatred. According to <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/inside-the-ku-klux-klan\"><strong>Inside the Ku Klux Klan</strong> </a>(Channel 4), they also claim to be the fastest growing KKK chapter in the US, thanks to a resurgent interest in white rights brought about, perversely, by the shootings of black people. I’m not taking their word for that – they look pretty small-time to me. One woman, Linda, still makes all the robes by hand. And there can’t be many people who, like Jeff, would drive 400 miles just to attend a cross-burning.</p> \n<p>“We’re not bad like everybody thinks we are,” said Jeff. This notion of being terribly misunderstood permeated the membership’s thinking. “Most of us are in it for the fraternal brotherhood aspect of it,” said Frank Ancona, delivery driver and Imperial Wizard of the Knights for the past six years.</p> \n<p>Former lumberjack and ex-hard-partier John reckons that the Klan actually keeps him out of trouble. His wife, Heather, highlighted the benefits to their relationship. “It honestly has helped my marriage,” she said.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>There is of course something indelibly comic about the Klan, and this film was not shy about playing it up</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It’s unclear whether all this dissembling is a by-product of being a 21st-century racist, or whether it’s just a condition of membership in the Traditionalist American Knights. To hear them tell it, the KKK is just a club for white folks who like dressing up and hanging out in the woods. Do they bother lying to themselves like this when the cameras are off?</p> \n<p>They’re certainly wary of bad press. When Rick, the Grand Kludd (sort of like a chaplain, but racist), was out raising his Confederate and KKK flags, he attracted the attention of a passing young racist who was predictably off-message. “White power, how you guys doin?” he said, going on to pose for a picture while giving a Nazi salute. Rick was visibly uncomfortable. “That’s Nazi, I don’t like that,” he said, before demonstrating his much less Nazi left-handed version and sending the kid off with a cheery “Have a nice white day.”</p> \n<p>There is of course something indelibly comic about the Klan, and this film was not shy about playing it up – filming Ancona shovelling snow in his purple robes and pointy hat. The health-and-safety briefing just before the cross-burning (“Don’t turn your back on the cross, ever”) was also amusing, but the viewer was left in no doubt that these people are dangerous: they’re armed to the teeth, motivated by twisted logic and chillingly indifferent to evils perpetrated by fellow racists. While Vernon was filming his documentary, three members of the KKK – all corrections officers – were arrested in Florida for plotting to kill a black man. “Every organisation has bad people,” said one Knight in response.</p> \n<p>That event – along with a cyber-attack by <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/anonymous\">Anonymous</a> that hacked and published Klan members’ Facebook profiles – seems to have cut short Imperial Wizard Frank’s PR offensive. Chances are he would have undermined himself anyway. The film finished with him playing electric guitar and singing a patriotic song of his own devising: “Time to take our country back my friend/No more bowing to the faggots in DC/Goddamn them all/I always will be free.” Then he smiled as if he’d just finished a verse of Kumbaya.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b062npph\"><strong>Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen – Cracking China</strong></a><strong> </strong>(BBC2) followed the former Changing Rooms star as he tried to extend his homeware range, House of Laurence, abroad. The title was a bit misleading – fully half the programme was about Mexico – but you were free to turn off halfway through if you felt hard done by. I wasn’t.</p> \n<p>Llewelyn-Bowen’s company has suffered some unspecified reverses of late, and he sees overseas expansion as his “last chance”. If things didn’t work out, he said, he’d be forced to “do Strictly, or eat kangaroo testicles in the jungle.” Llewelyn-Bowen was mostly his usual public self: brash, confident, imperious, gauche. When he says a thing, it doesn’t seem terribly important that he believes it first. “This is exactly the sort of look that Victoria Beckham, Princess Kate, everybody now in the UK is very much into,” he told the Chinese sales force on training day.</p> \n<p>Whether you find him engaging or irksome as a presenter, LLB is terribly compelling as a subject. His face hides nothing: boredom, confusion, sadness, despair. He’s a tragic hero awaiting a tragedy. Unfortunately things seem to be going rather well for him in China.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436809925217/A-member-of-the-Tradition-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A member of the Traditionalist American Knights chapter of the Ku Klux Klan Photograph: Alexander Ayer / Channel 4 Telev","credit":"Alexander Ayer / Channel 4 Telev/Alexander Ayer / Channel 4 Telev","altText":"A member of the Traditionalist American Knights chapter of the Ku Klux Klan","cleanCaption":"A member of the Traditionalist American Knights chapter of the Ku Klux Klan Photograph: Alexander Ayer / Channel 4 Telev"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T06:00:09Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T06:00:09Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":18,"contributors":[{"name":"Tim Dowling","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733750190/TimDowling.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/timdowling"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Television & radio","Culture","Television","Race issues","World news"],"tags":[{"id":"tv-and-radio/tv-and-radio","webTitle":"Television & radio"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"culture/television","webTitle":"Television"},{"id":"world/race","webTitle":"Race issues"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"}],"section":{"id":"tv-and-radio"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tim Dowling","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/timdowling"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"tv-and-radio"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","navigationButtonColour":"#333333","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","quoteColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/14/ku-klux-klan-white-supremacy-tv-review","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aj92","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/14/ku-klux-klan-white-supremacy-tv-review","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/jul/14/ku-klux-klan-white-supremacy-tv-review"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436809925217/A-member-of-the-Tradition-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A member of the Traditionalist American Knights chapter of the Ku Klux Klan.

It was a no-brainer – not just because it was the coolest song, but because we knew we could make it our own. I remember saying to Richard: “Four Weddings and a Funeral? Are you sure about that title?”</p> \n<p>We recorded it in just one day in 1993. We sent a copy of it to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2013/feb/05/reg-presley\">Reg Presley</a>, the Troggs’ frontman. Thankfully, he loved it – imagine if he’d thought we’d assassinated it.</p> \n<p>Its success was phenomenal: No 1 for almost five months. The song played out Top of the Pops so many times, it basically became the theme tune. As the weeks turned to months, though, we could see moods changing. I remember going to a cinema in Glasgow when we’d been No 1 for three months. The trailer for Four Weddings started running and Love Is All Around came on. I heard the guy behind go: “God, not that song again!” I turned round and said: “Hey, imagine how I feel!”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"1b507dd2f277b18cbf47739aaa7cd31461cb7626\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436802603292/fa1fab87-9f7f-47cf-93af-3493e08df5c6-311x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Marti Pellow of Wet Wet Wet at Wembley Stadium, London, in 1995.\" width=\"311\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Full guns blazing’ … Marti Pellow of Wet Wet Wet at Wembley Stadium, London, in 1995.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Rasic/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the last week before we withdrew it from production, it was still selling 120,000 copies a week. We were thinking: “Who is even buying it now?” Withdrawing it from sale wasn’t some cunning plan to make it sell more – we’re not that smart. It was just time to put the song to bed.</p> \n<p>My life was full guns blazing then. I’d think nothing of jumping on a plane and doing a couple of countries in a day. Looking back, I wish I’d taken the time to enjoy it more. But I don’t see the success of Love Is All Around as being a catalyst for the horrible chapter in my life afterwards. The alcohol and drugs came later. I’ve been sober for 15 years now.</p> \n<p>There are freaky records everyone seems to have: Dire Straits, Sade – and Love Is All Around. It’s incredible how far it spread. A Spanish friend once told me that they learned it in school during English lessons.</p> \n<h2><strong>Graeme Clark, bassist</strong></h2> \n<p>We had this fancy keyboard but could never fit anything we played on it into our songs. When we recorded Love Is All Around, though, it just worked. So that’s the very first note you hear.</p> \n<p>As soon as the song was released, I knew something big was happening. Emma Freud, who was married to Richard Curtis, was a Radio 1 DJ at the time and played it nonstop. Obviously it was an amazing time, but if any record gets played nonstop, people are going to get sick of it. I read about people taking it out of jukeboxes. And then Jarvis Cocker went on Top of the Pops and opened his jacket to <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/news/art-brut/23784\">reveal a sign</a> saying: “I hate <a href=\"http://wetwetwet.co.uk/\">Wet Wet Wet</a>.” I took that stuff personally then. But now I’m glad it all happened – put it this way, it bought my house. And hey, it could have been worse. It could have been The Birdie Song. Even now, when I hear it, I think it’s a good bit of work.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Maybe pulling it was an arrogant thing to do. Even Reg Presley of the Troggs had a pop at us</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>We were already a successful band, but this kicked us to a different level. We would do things like fly curries from Glasgow out to Denmark (they don’t travel well). We came from a poor background in Clydebank near Glasgow, and we found ourselves in a mad party world. We were ordinary people an extraordinary thing happened to.</p> \n<p>We eventually realised that if it stayed at No 1 any longer, it was going to take over our lives. So we stopped new copies of the record being made. Looking back, maybe it was an arrogant thing to do. Reg Presley even had a pop at us. But that was the bloody mindedness of four Scots.</p> \n<p>When it first went to No 1, we were recording on the Italian island of Capri, not an easy place to get to. The record company wanted us to keep going on Top of the Pops, so we’d sell more records. In the end, we said we wouldn’t unless they got us a private plane.

This summer, “cheeky” comedian Paul Eastwood is the headline act, and comedy stuntman Ben Langley will dangle above the small, packed auditorium in a straitjacket.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Daily shows mid-June to late September, from &pound;10, </em><a href=\"http://www.cromerpier.co.uk/whats-on/\"><em>cromerpier.co.uk</em></a></p> \n<h2><strong>Dingles Fairground Heritage Centre, Lifton, Devon</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02172cc442ceaa9e799ecfb6f9dfb5901c0c5d0a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436789760617/69d4e421-9b90-4615-b055-da5be3189be0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dingles Steam Village, Fairground Heritage Center,\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allison Davidson/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Although Dingles is smack bang in the middle of Devon, it is a depository of seaside attractions. These rides once travelled the country as part of larger shows, but ended up here, before being restored and returned to service. Michael Smith of Dingles was historic rides consultant for <a href=\"http://www.dreamland.co.uk\">Margate’s Dreamland</a>, and the place has a wealth of information and vintage rides – the dodgems, which date from 1932, being one of the most popular. There is also a vintage arcade from the 1960s and a Brett’s Ghost Train (1947), which still has four of its original fleet of cars. The Rodeo Switchback was built in 1880 and, although not operational, is the last Spinning Top Switchback in existence; in fact, it is probably the oldest surviving fairground ride in the country. You can’t ride on that one, though. <br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Open Feb half-term week then late March-early Nov, from &pound;10.71 adults, &pound;9.18 kids for 10 rides, </em><em><a href=\"http://fairground-heritage.org.uk/\">fairground-heritage.org.uk</a></em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/may/28/10-of-the-most-bizarre-homemade-attractions\">10 of the most bizarre homemade playgrounds and attractions</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach, Suffolk</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9a6b4cf04d4aadfb806d4184913e6dcc0ed0f3ef\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436789998491/87391e18-cd73-4b45-80aa-57909a6dbe5d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Great Yarmouth Pleasure Beach</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nik Taylor/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The 30 horses on the carousel at the entrance of Great Yarmouth’s Pleasure Beach have been trotting around with their manes flying since 1915.

The Pleasure Beach also boasts the wooden Scenic Railway rollercoaster: built in France in 1928 and opened in 1932, it’s the second fastest and highest wooden rollercoaster in the UK, and is similar to the one at Dreamland. Three carriages, each containing 30 people, are pulled to the top before being released – a seated operator at the rear of each carriage applies judicious use of the brakes, as gravity propels the pleasure seekers along the track.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Open end of March-early Nov (opening times vary), free entry, unlimited access to 25 rides from &pound;17.50 for adults and children 7+, &pound;13.50 for 4-6 year-olds, </em><a href=\"http://www.pleasure-beach.co.uk/\"><em>pleasure-beach.co.uk</em></a></p> \n<h2><strong>Blackgang Chine, Isle of Wight</strong><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a10c2f70b4ab13b69e194d87ac13a957ed538d6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436790279764/7cb3ee58-3d4e-4963-8171-6cb34a4e0a32-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"Blackgang Chine, Isle of Wight\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The UK’s oldest theme park, owned by the Dabell family since its foundation in 1843, is tucked away in a ravine on the south coast of the Isle of Wight.

For most people under 30, prospects are bleak. </p> \n<p>The biggest challenge in today’s society is to smile tightly and explain yet again to your mum that yes, your friend from school married a banker and bought a three-bedroom house in Surrey, but no, you can’t afford to move out of your mouldy flatshare just yet. Youth unemployment is at its worst for 20 years, with 16- to 24-year-olds three times as likely to be unemployed as any other section of the population, and even if you have a job, more likely than not it’s a dead-end one.

Nicholas Hoult was sneering it up in Skins way back in 2007. But now it’s ubiquitous; screenwriters have realised that audiences don’t need to love a lead character to watch a show. Girls has, of course, taught us that. No one watching it finds Lena Dunham’s Hannah Horvath anything other than teeth-grittingly unbearable (and don’t even get us started on Marnie) – yet the show is filming its fourth series right now. Maybe its enduring popularity is because, as Hannah’s life comes crashing down around her, again, you can’t help but feel a little thrill of schadenfreude. Rather than getting annoyed, you’re feeling comforted. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab455d75aefe3e6681767eac86ad064af52e78b2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436382648534/a6c0bd29-d58a-45e1-a8fa-33475f95a6a9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Jack Whitehall as JP and Joe Thomas as Kingsley in Fresh Meat.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bantman return: Jack Whitehall as JP and Joe Thomas as Kingsley in Fresh Meat.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you’re Hannah’s age, you’re happy she’s ruining her life much worse that you’re messing yours up. And if you’re older, it’s reassuring to see those millennials, with their Snapchats and their overconfidence, their easy assurance that, one day, they’ll take your job and retire you, will eventually get their comeuppance. Alternatively, these characters are so useless you root for them. Broad City adds extra empathy into the mix: Abby and Ilana may be rubbish employees, girlfriends and flatmates, but at least they care about each other, unlike the girls of Girls, all self-centred and only out for themselves.</p> \n<p>Currently this trend shows no sign of slowing – it’s even making the leap to film. It’s no coincidence that John Niven’s Kill Your Friends is finally getting its big-screen adaptation, out in November, with Nicholas Hoult (him again) playing the ultimate hateful antihero, the psychotic Steven Stelfox. He makes the rest of us look like Gandhi holding a kitten. At least in this age of self-loathing, there are plenty of fictional people to hate more than ourselves.</p>","section":"TV & Radio","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436461615888/fce21efb-9c3f-457f-a534-2acbb4661d2c-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ari Scott/Comedy Central","altText":"broad city","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ari Scott/Comedy Central"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436382886208/06a023cd-75a7-4e79-a384-3ad50ef9fecc-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Living large: the stars of Broad City.

We look at what new research tells us about the big choices in life</p> \n<h2>Cats v dogs</h2> \n<p>Are you a cat person or a dog person? The UK is renowned as a <a href=\"http://www.pfma.org.uk/pet-population-2014/\">nation of pet-lovers</a> and – after fish – cats and dogs are by far the most popular; 24% of households own a dog, and 18% own a cat.</p> \n<p>So which creature is best to share your house with? Some of it obviously comes down to how high-maintenance you want your pet to be; do you really want to take them out for a walk each morning and constantly pick up their poo? Then again, cat allergies are around twice as common as dog allergies.</p> \n<p>“The evergreen statement is that ‘Dogs like their owner, cats like the owner’s home’ – by which they truly mean ‘cats do not like people’,” says P&eacute;ter Pongr&aacute;cz of the <a href=\"http://familydogproject.elte.hu/\">Family Dog Project</a> in Budapest, Hungary. But it’s not necessarily as simple as that.</p> \n<p>Dogs were domesticated before humans invented agriculture and livestock breeding. Their existence depended on their ability to stay close to, and be accepted, by humans. Although dogs are territorial, their concept of territoriality is highly flexible: wherever their owner goes will be their territory.</p> \n<p>Cats, on the other hand, were domesticated when humans began to build permanent settlements in the Middle East; mostly as a home-guard against pests such as rodents. Their existence depends on the physical home, and so this is what they regard – and defend – as their own territory.</p> \n<p>Both cat and dog owners attribute highly sophisticated cognitive and social skills to their pets, but it’s very difficult to say which animal is truly superior. Dog behaviour has attracted more research – possibly because cats need to be tested in their own homes. “The real lesson is that dogs and cats provide a similar experience to their owners as a thinking, feeling, empathic companion,” says Pongr&aacute;cz.</p> \n<p>They may also boost your health. Children who live with a dog during their first year of life seem to have <a href=\"http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2012/07/03/peds.2011-2825.abstract?sid=73a8fcd1-ad41-4099-8e99-afa57ce00e1f\">fewer respiratory tract and ear infections</a>, while several studies have suggested that ownership of either pet reduces stress levels, and may lower blood pressure.</p> \n<p>Among older adults, owning a cat may even reduce your chances of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3317329/\">dying from cardiovascular disease</a>. In this context, the scratched furniture and smelly carpets seem a small price to pay.</p> \n<h2>Children v child-free</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-3174a6ae-77ba-433b-9065-1be051adc146\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436518973378/2ee0ff0b-d340-4b95-b2d9-b7896d2a5bef-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Elizabeth Gilbert\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Eat, Pray, Love author Elizabeth Gilbert, decided she didn’t want children.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rick Madonik/Getty</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One in five women have not produced children by the age of 45, a proportion that only looks set to increase in the future. Admittedly, parenthood isn’t always a choice; accidental pregnancy and infertility can scupper even the best-laid plans.</p> \n<p>But whether you want them or not, there’s no doubt that children have a profound effect on your life, providing a sense of purpose, enduring love and companionship on one hand, while being a massive drain on your financial resources, free-time and the environment, on the other. So which group is happier overall, parents or non-parents?</p> \n<p>When it comes to romantic relationships, the answer seems clear: “It really does seem to hold that child-free couples are happier with their relationships and happier with their partner than those who are parents,” says Jacqui Gabb of the Open University’s <a href=\"http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/enduringlove/\">Enduring Love Project</a> (http://www.open.ac.uk/researchprojects/enduringlove/), which examines the factors that make long-term relationships work. “And same-sex couples who are child-free are the happiest group.” And it’s not simply that child-free couples have more time on their hands – they might have a very intense relationship with their God, or have a hobby that takes up a lot of their time, for instance. A key difference seems to be that they are still more likely to try to make time for one another; to say “I love you” and to talk openly to one another, Gabb has found. In this respect, parents might take some lessons from them, be it through going on regular “date nights”, taking the dog for a walk together, or simply going out for a quiet coffee on a regular basis.</p> \n<p>But there are also upsides to parenting. Although mothers may be less happy with their romantic relationships, they are the happiest group overall, Gabb found. And <a href=\"http://www.hioa.no/asset/3554/1/3554_1.pdf\">a large Norwegian study published</a> in the journal <em>Social Indicators Research</em> suggests that childless women report significantly lower life satisfaction and self-esteem than mothers – though this may alter as the expectations society places on women changes. So too, might the impact of having children on men’s lives; for now at least, the average difference in emotional wellbeing between fathers and non-fathers is less marked.</p> \n<h2>Married v single</h2> \n<p>Bridget Jones called them Smug Marrieds – people in long-term relationships who pity the single. But, irritating as they may be, it seems married couples do have at least one thing to feel superior about: their health. Numerous studies have found a correlation between being married and a lower risk of diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular and respiratory problems. The effect is more pronounced for men, but women who are married or live with their partner also seem to have better health.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"e6dff900afe1d8e051f5e313e3f905ea514c5caa\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436518341346/ceb41467-3e67-44ea-b7f6-0c8d582b4168-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Newlyweds George Clooney and Amal Alamuddin\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After a long stint as a bachelor George Clooney wed Amal Alamuddin, in Venice, Sep 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa USA/REX/Sipa USA/REX</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are various theories about this might be, says George Ploubidis of University College London, who has tracked the long-term health of people born in 1958 and correlated it with their relationship status. “On average, people who are in long-term relationships tend to have a healthier lifestyle than the single,” he says. “They may have a higher joint income, and relationships can also boost social networking and provide a buffer against the stresses of everyday life and major events.”</p> \n<p>But many single people may be just as healthy or healthier than those who are married. If you look after yourself, have a relatively good income and plenty of friends, you may be as healthy as those Smug Marrieds. For one thing, unmarried people appear to spend more time exercising, which could bring <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3737.2004.00029.x/abstract\">a host of benefits</a>.</p> \n<p>Neither should you stay in a bad relationship to avoid singledom; a study of 9,011 UK civil servants <a href=\"http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=413183\">linked stressful relationships to a heightened risk of heart disease</a>, while other research suggests <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11822923\">divorce temporarily raises the risk of death from all causes</a>.</p> \n<p>In the long-term, however, Ploubidis’s study suggests it’s still probably better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all: “We found that people who experienced divorce or separation – as long as somewhere down the line they start a new relationship – their health at mid-life was similar to those in stable relationships.”</p> \n<h2>Social media v face-to-face contact</h2> \n<p>Are you connected? According to recent statistics, 59% of the UK population now have <a href=\"http://socialmedialondon.co.uk/digital-social-mobile-statistics-2015/\">active social media accounts</a>, with Facebook by far the most popular (43% of the population use it). Social media undoubtedly have benefits, be it staying in touch with friends, hearing about news or events, or connecting with interesting – or useful – strangers. On the other hand, it may be a bit of a pact with the devil; because if you are not careful you could compromise your privacy and hand over your personal data to goodness knows whom. Privacy concerns aside, there may be other downsides to Facebook use. Recent studies have suggested that it may <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2012/mar/17/facebook-dark-side-study-aggressive-narcissism\">encourage narcissism</a>, and it is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/apr/20/facebook-loneliness-peoples-panel\">associated with loneliness</a> – although this is probably because lonely people are more likely to use Facebook.</p> \n<p>It’s also possible that constantly reading about your friends’ lives could leave you feeling less satisfied with your own.</p> \n<p>Ethan Kross at the University of Michigan has been studying the effect of Facebook use on subjective <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0069841\">wellbeing in college students</a>. He says that there are two very different ways of using the technology; you can actively communicate with people and post information of your own, or you can be a passive user – simply checking your newsfeed and looking at other people’s photos.</p> \n<p>“Our research shows that when you engage in this kind of voyeuristic usage of the technology, it consistently leads to declines in how good people feel from one moment to the next,” says Kross. “Possibly this is because you’re constantly comparing yourself to other people, and when people post information, it’s usually of good things.” Being an active user didn’t necessarily make people feel better about themselves, “it just doesn’t harm you,” Kross says.</p> \n<p>So tighten up your privacy settings; become an active user, rather than a lurker, and you’ll maximise your chances of social media working for you</p> \n<h2>Urban v rural</h2> \n<p>Eighty per cent of the UK population live in towns and cities, yet the urban landscape accounts for just 6.8% of the UK’s land area, so city-dwellers are, relatively speaking, packed together like sardines. Cities generally mean more noise, crime, aggression, and poorer air quality; but there are also more facilities, not just cinemas, galleries and nightclubs; but hospitals, medical specialists, and emergency services are more readily accessible. So how does city living stack up against the rural idyll in terms of health and happiness?</p> \n<p>It depends. If you <a href=\"http://www.healthmegamall.com/Articles/BabeskinArticle279.pdf\">compare elderly people</a> living in urban Nottingham or rural Cambridgeshire, village-dwellers report eating a healthier diet, whereas urbanites spend more time walking. Then there are stress levels: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/cities/2014/feb/25/city-stress-mental-health-rural-kind\">recent research</a> suggests that the brains of city-dwellers may be more primed to react to stressful stimuli, while urban living has also been found to raise the risk of anxiety and mood disorders by 21% and 39% respectively.</p> \n<p>If you look at death rates, the biggest differences between town and country are for respiratory disease and lung cancer, with more city-dwellers succumbing. But at least some of this is related to higher levels of social deprivation and smoking in cities. Accidental death, on the other hand, is more common in the countryside, possibly because there are more fatal road traffic accidents.</p> \n<p>Then there’s happiness. According to 2011-2014 data from the Office for National Statistics, if you ask people how happy they were yesterday, those living in the City of London, Corby and Wolverhampton will likely give the lowest scores, while residents of Eilean Siar in the Western Isles or Armagh in Northern Ireland will give the highest. City of London residents also said they were the most anxious, while those living in rural Fermanagh in Northern Ireland reported the lowest anxiety levels. However, the differences between areas are pretty small and are likely dwarfed by factors such as health, relationship status or employment status. But “in general, those who live in urban areas have lower life-satisfaction, a lower sense that the things they do are worth while, and higher anxiety levels than those who live in rural areas, regardless of their age,” says Lucy Tinkler, head of the personal wellbeing team at the ONS.</p> \n<h2>Omnivore v vegan</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-8c479c3e-1c9c-4b75-9d3f-75a47b8dc130\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436518735608/b3647b00-5699-424e-a0e1-974c91a90266-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Carl Lewis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Being vegan didn’t prevent Carl Lewis from winning ten Olympic medals.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: G.RANCINAN/CORBIS SYGMA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Depending on what you read, tucking into a juicy steak is either a death sentence or a delicious way to boost your iron levels. Veganism, meanwhile, is de rigueur for some, with celebrities such as Beyonc&eacute; turning their backs on meat for at least limited periods, if not entirely. So should we follow?</p> \n<p>From an environmental perspective, avid meat consumption is bad news. As much as 32% of greenhouse gas emissions come from rearing animals for food, particularly cattle, while it takes 15,500 litres of water (equivalent to a small swimming pool) to produce a single kilogram of beef. But eliminating livestock, or substituting cattle with chickens or pigs, isn’t a perfect solution: there’s plenty of pasture land that can’t be used to grow crops, but can be grazed for ever. And animals can be fed the bits of crops – like stalks and leaves – that we can’t eat, reducing waste. Even Friends of the Earth believes meat consumption can be sustainable, but we need to eat less and cut out mass-produced options.</p> \n<p>It’s a similar picture where our health is concerned. Numerous studies have linked the consumption of red meat with bowel cancer and heart disease, though the precise degree of risk is up for debate. The European-wide <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/11/63\">EPIC trial</a>, for instance, found no link between the consumption of fresh red meat and cancer, but concluded that for every 50 grams of processed meat (roughly equivalent to a sausage) people consume a day, the risk of early death from all causes increases by 18%. “Eating meat is good for the intake of certain micro-nutrients, but consumption should not be too high; that’s the only reasonable advice we can give for now,” says Sabine Rohrmann, an epidemiologist at the University of Zurich, and lead researcher of the EPIC trial. “And processed meat should definitely not be on the menu every day.” But would it be healthier to go vegetarian? The EPIC results suggest not. “What we see from studies like EPIC is an indication that people who eat small amounts of meat are as healthy, or maybe healthier, than vegetarians,” says Rohrmann. Possibly this is because vegetarianism doesn’t always automatically equate to a healthy diet.</p> \n<p>Also, there’s no evidence that eating poultry or fish, which are packed with protein and nutrients, increases cancer risk.</p> \n<p>“It is perfectly fine to be a vegetarian, but you should take care about what you’re eating to ensure you don’t become deficient in nutrients such as iron, zinc and B vitamins,” says Rohrmann.</p> \n<h2>Save v spend</h2> \n<p>The debate over whether to pursue a policy of austerity, or spend our way out of debt, rages on at a national level, but what about our personal finances? Save those pennies for a rainy day, or splash out on the latest gadget that promises to boost your productivity or simply gives you pleasure?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"02f2bef3d7abaa1dd23cc2a5561757db77f04079\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436519830565/fe5aea3a-b617-4bd4-b5fe-1510a3aa7bb4-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Would Kim and Kanye be just as happy on $75,000?\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Would Kim and Kanye be just as happy on $75,000?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Theo Wargo/WireImage for Gabrielle's Angel</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>People often say that money can’t buy you happiness, but Elizabeth Dunn, professor of psychology at the University of British Columbia and co-author of <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/happy-money.html\">Happy Money</a>, says: “Income does matter to happiness; it’s better to make more money than not a lot. But the relationship is smaller than most people assume.”</p> \n<p>Indeed, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2010/sep/06/earnings-pay-happiness-research\">a recent study</a> found that once people reach an annual salary of $75,000 (about &pound;48,000) any additional income has no bearing on how much they laugh or smile on any given day.</p> \n<p>What’s arguably equally important though, is how you spend your money. When Dunn and her colleagues randomly gave college students $5 or $20, and either instructed them to spend it on themselves or another person, <a href=\"http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/23/1/41.full\">those who spent it on someone else reported a happier mood</a> for the rest of the day, regardless of how much money they received.</p> \n<p>On the basis of this, and other research, Dunn has come up with five rules for getting the biggest happiness bang for your buck. Besides spending your money on other people, you’re likely to get more pleasure from buying experiences such as holidays or trips to the theatre, than from material objects. You should also try to make spending a treat; having our favourite things a little less often seems to enhance our ability to enjoy them. Similarly, delaying gratification by saving for things seems to produce more pleasure than simply buying them on credit, when they can appear to come for free. Finally, buy time: “Spending money on a cleaner may free you up to enjoy your Saturday afternoon with your family rather than tidying the house,” says Dunn.</p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Observer/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436451460387/Field-with-Sun-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"If you can only get one pet, should it be a cat or a dog?

Of the films featured at the annual convention for all things blockbuster and pop culture-related, Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice had the most buzz going into Hall H, Comic-Con’s main stage. The panels accomplished their collective goal of sending fans into a near-deafening state of hysteria both in San Diego and online, but one film came out on top by sticking to the tried and tested mantra of the slow reveal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jul/11/star-wars-force-awakens-with-standing-ovation-for-harrison-ford-at-comic-con\">Star Wars force awakens with standing ovation for Harrison Ford at Comic-Con</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The second day of Comic-Con 2015 brought the first major panel of the event for JJ Abrams’s first stab at the Star Wars franchise. True to rumours, Abrams brought fans a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the movie, before getting underway with an hour-long discussion that featured most of the movie’s major players, including returning franchise stars Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and, somewhat surprisingly, a very game and sincere Harrison Ford, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/jul/11/star-wars-force-awakens-with-standing-ovation-for-harrison-ford-at-comic-con\">who drew a standing ovation</a> (a rarity at Comic-Con) upon his late entrance to Hall H.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTNJ51ghzdY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/CTNJ51ghzdY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The Star Wars Comic-Con reel was made immediately available upon the conclusion of the panel and has so far amassed more than 5m views on YouTube. The tangible aspect of the movie is the main focus of the tease. It goes to great lengths over its 3:42min running time to showcase the use of real sets and practical effects on The Force Awakens, over the onslaught of CGI that rendered the prequel trilogy so lifeless. The featurette’s angle is a strong one and connects with fans of the original trilogy in an incredibly poignant way. It also does a sly job of teasing Fisher’s new look as Leia and Simon Pegg’s mysterious involvement as a rumoured alien in the movie, without actually showing the actors in action.</p> \n<p>The panel that followed was also a grand slam that benefited greatly from Ford’s participation. The actor, who once <a href=\"http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.244758-Han-Should-Have-Died-in-Return-of-the-Jedi-Says-Harrison-Ford\">lobbied</a> to have his character, Han Solo, killed off in The Return of the Jedi, appeared emotional when speaking about what returning to the franchise meant to him. “I was proud and grateful to once again be involved,” he said. Best of all, he gamely accompanied the crew to a surprise concert of John Williams’ music from Star Wars, a few hours later, for 6,000 lucky fans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8fMx670jOnw\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8fMx670jOnw?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>The behind-the-scenes reveal marks the latest coup in a resoundingly successful marketing strategy for The Force Awakens. Much like Paramount Pictures’ promotional approach for Abrams’s 2011 blockbuster, Super 8, the promos for Abrams’s new film are notable for what they tease, not what they give away. Despite the movie’s fast-approaching release date of 18 December, Abrams confirmed at the panel that the next trailer for his epic won’t arrive until the fall - an extended reveal that’s sure to send hype for the blockbuster further into overdrive.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/filmblog/2015/jul/13/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice-trailer-comic-con-lex-luthor\">Five things we learned from the new Batman v Superman trailer</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Warner Bros has been taking an opposite approach to tout the impending release of their comic book behemoth, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, the sequel to Zack Snyder’s Man of Steel, which brings the two popular superheroes to the screen for the first time together. The film isn’t set to open until 25 March in the US, yet already the studio has debuted a two-minute mini-teaser – matching the length of most trailers – and, following its Comic-Con debut, an extended trailer that clocks in at close to five minutes. It features plenty of action and appearances from major players unseen until now, including Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot) and main villain Lex Luthor (Jesse Eisenberg).</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457479383__\n</div> \n<p>The Comic-Con trailer is impressively mounted and resoundingly loud, but what it doesn’t appear to be is confident in its own product. By showcasing so much of the action close to a year before the full feature opens in cinemas, the promo does a disservice to fans by simply giving too much away.</p> \n<p>The approach recalls the one taken by Sony months ahead of the release of The Amazing Spider-Man 2. The studio was criticized for revealing too much in their teases and trailers for the sequel to Marc Webb’s reboot of the popular franchise. The footage led a fan to <a href=\"http://www.slashfilm.com/watch-25minute-cut-the-amazing-spiderman-courtesy-sonys-marketing-materials/\">splice together a 25-minute cut of the movie</a>, ahead of its release, that was cut entirely from promotional material for the blockbuster. </p> \n<p>Given how Warner Bros has taken to the marketing for Batman v Superman, it’s only a matter of time before this film gets a similar treatment from a savvy fan. </p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436792413673/f11ecaf1-0d52-47c6-8373-f0c5b82b906e-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Richard Shotwell/Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP","altText":"Carrie Fisher, from left, Mark Hamill, and Harrison Ford attend Lucasfilm's \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens\" panel on day 2 of Comic-Con International on Friday, July 10, 2015, in San Diego, Calif.
