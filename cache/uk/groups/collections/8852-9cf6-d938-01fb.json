In this alternate timeline, the genius of 1984’s splendidly cheesy The Terminator and its sleek, superior follow-up Terminator 2: Judgment Day, are the only history that matters.</p> \n<p>It’s the kind of thing the fans want to hear. But the reality is that Terminator Genisys is part remake, part reboot, mostly failure. Sold simultaneously on the promise of returning to the franchise’s roots and innovating for a new generation, instead, Thor: The Dark World director Alan Taylor’s sequel apes the first two films’ iconicism, but falls short of achieving any in its own right.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62E4FJTwSuc\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/62E4FJTwSuc?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Watch the Terminator Genisys trailer\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is sent back in time by John Connor (Jason Clarke) to protect his mother, Sarah Connor (Game of Thrones star Emilia Clarke), from the Terminator. Reese arrives in 1984 as per the original film, but – somehow (something about a “nexus”) – the timeline’s altered and in this reality it’s Sarah looking out for Kyle. They’re aided by a version of the Terminator (<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1340138/reference\">re-christened the Guardian</a> and played by Schwarzenegger) that’s been watching out for Sarah since an attack on her family by the machines left her orphaned as a child. She calls him “Pops”, while he – still, in any timeline you like, a machine – finds her affection baffling. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/feb/26/arnold-schwarzenegger-terminator-sequel\">Hasta la vista, gramps!

There’s the yellow dump truck, a lookalike of its cigar-chomping driver and naked CGI Arnold, crouched in the shallow blasted out by his time-travelling orb. The punks are still there, still wondering what’s wrong with this picture. Kyle’s feathercut has gone, but he still pulls on his stolen high tops languorously enough to give the Nike branding a good showing.

The lore is disconnected and rewired, making for a confusing, but sporadically entertaining ride for anyone who remembers the originals. At times Taylor offers a Comic Relief sketch version of The Terminator: more ridiculous than revolutionary. </p> \n<p>Genisys – because of its 12A certification – lacks the first two chapters’ wallop. Cameron’s films were unusual for mainstream cinema in that they sutured violence to character to give it meaning. The Terminator was murderous without thought, but with cause. The gore – the body horror of the Terminator repairing an eye socket or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mStmiGS43jQ\">flaying an arm to prove a point</a> – was grounded in the story. The slaughter of humanity felt real. There’s no fear here. No real sense of dread. The techno-paranoid get an Apple-ish operating system (the Genisys of the title) to worry about, but a tablet can’t inspire terror. The CGI doesn’t look to have evolved much from Judgement Day. The film feels soft and phoney. In the original Terminator Kyle Reese described how the humans could tell when the robots were trying to pass themselves off as alive: “They had rubber skin. We spotted them easy.” Watching Genisys, you can relate.</p> \n<p>Salvation was boring, but Genisys makes you sad. Risk-averse Hollywood has made a crash-test dummy of a once great franchise, simply throwing everything at it to see what it stands. It’s heartbreaking to watch Arnie execute the same old programmes: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyTHz9N5KNE\">the terrible robo-smile</a>; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHRqgxA8wZs\">the slang</a>; the wear and tear of his living tissue revealing the cyborg underneath. “Old, but not obsolete,” the Terminator/Guardian tells us when his age is brought into question. In truth, it feels like both.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-f35a6d0c-f30f-47a2-836a-d69930fd0c47\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435656337224/512a7546-4910-4ff7-a91e-6d3616442c9c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Schwarzenegger in Terminator: Genisys.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Old version ...

Judgment Day redefined the action genre, CGI and the star system, creating a thirst for sequels that still leads studio decision-making today. It was a radical film, one that escaped the B-movie trappings of its predecessor by locking into a genuinely terrifying vision of mankind supplanted. Cameron wasn’t scared to move on either.

But few creatures can match the hermaphrodite flatworm, which scientists have discovered can reproduce by injecting sperm into its own head.</p> \n<p>The tiny aquatic worm, <em>Macrostomum hystix</em>, is able to self-fertilise because it produces both eggs and sperm. Although it prefers to reproduce with other flatworms, when no mating opportunities are present it resorts to using its needle-like penis to inject sperm into its own head. </p> \n<p>The sperm then swim down the creature’s transparent body to fertilise eggs in the tail region, leading to viable offspring.</p> \n<p>Dr Steven Ramm, an evolutionary biologist who led the work at Bielefeld University in Germany, said: “To us it sounds very gruesome, but to them it may be their best option. The alternative is not reproducing at all, so it’s making the best of a bad situation.”</p> \n<p>The scientists believe the worms evolved their ability for “hypodermic insemination”, where sperm is injected directly into the body, because it allows individuals to enforce mating and overcomes any adaptation to the recipient’s reproductive tract, such as a plug left by another individual. “By evolving this way, creatures are able to take control over sperm transfer,” said Ramm.</p> \n<p>“After developing the hypodermic penis, the worms developed a more simplified sperm, which allows it to be more mobile, and burrow through the body,” he added.<br /></p> \n<p>In the study, published in the <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/lookup/doi/10.1098/rspb.2015.0660\">Proceedings of the Royal Society B</a>, 100 flatworms were split into two batches. The first were kept as isolated individuals, while in the second, worms were kept in groups of three. After four weeks, sperm living in the 1.5 milimetre-long worms was counted using a microscope.</p> \n<p>The worms living in groups had more sperm in their tails, while those that were isolated had more sperm in their head or middle regions, suggesting they had swung their sharpened penis around to inject themselves in the head.<br />The flatworm is not the only animal capable of reproducing alone.

The situation seems to be that for nine years, for some reason we can’t explain, we stopped paying the premiums of &pound;54.35 per month. Aviva did not draw our attention to the missed payments. Instead, it paid the premiums out of what would have been the amount payable on maturation of the policy. </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Then it created a loan, with whopping interest, to pay the missing premiums. It did not inform us what it was doing, let alone ask if this is what we wanted. </strong></p> \n<p><strong>Having to find the extra &pound;6,000 for the missed premiums is difficult enough, although we accept that we owe the money, but an extra &pound;7,000 interest for a loan we never asked for seems to me entirely unreasonable and, given we have signed nothing to authorise this, probably illegal.</strong> <em>GR, Northumberland</em></p> \n<p>The Financial Ombudsman Service tells me that it receives a steady trickle of complaints about missed policy payments and covering loans that have not been flagged up. It says that, when it investigates such cases, it expects to see evidence that the finance company informed the policyholder about the loan and its terms plus a detailed breakdown of how the interest was calculated.</p> \n<p>The question has to be asked: how come you didn’t notice that the payments had stopped leaving your account each month for nine years?</p> \n<p>Aviva says it wrote to you twice about the missed premiums which actually stopped in 2003 and spoke twice to your wife on the phone and it has provided you with copies of the letters and call records.</p> \n<p>However, after I asked it to investigate your case it finds that a non-forfeiture clause in the policy allows it to continue for 12 months if a customer missed payments, with an 8.5% interest rate applied to the missing payments. Under the terms and conditions it should never have been allowed to continue for more than the 12 months, as the 8.5% loan was never intended as a long-term facility.</p> \n<p>Instead, with no more payments forthcoming from you, the policy should have been paid up in 2004 and you would have received &pound;10,788.54. Aviva has retrospectively adjusted the interest rates on those loaned premiums using a method approved by the Financial Reporting Council in relation to non-forfeiture clauses.</p> \n<p>It is also honouring an endowment “promise” of &pound;7,200, which would not have been payable had the policy been made paid up in 2004.

Now a new Channel 4 drama aims to put Millennials under the spotlight, capturing this generation’s rootless insecurity in the same way 1990s hit This Life depicted the lives and loves, fears and failures of those who came of age at the dawn of New Labour.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/2015/jun/30/sacha-dhawan-not-safe-for-work\">Sacha Dhawan: 'My generation don't care who plays a part'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Not Safe for Work, written by award-winning playwright DC Moore and staring Zawe Ashton, is both a scathingly funny look at twentysomething life in the 21st century and a love letter to a generation left treading water by a perfect storm of job shortages and rising rent. </p> \n<p>“We’re something of a jilted generation and I wanted to tackle that,” said Moore, himself 35. It took a trip to the Northampton suburb where he grew up for the idea to crystalise. “I have a lot of friends who work in the civil service and found themselves really hit hard by the government cuts. I thought it would be interesting to tell a personal story that was also tied to the political because our lives are defined by those bigger political moments.”</p> \n<p>Not Safe for Work, while filled with sharp one-liners and amusing set pieces, is a much bleaker story than This Life. Miles, Anna and friends could afford to daydream about football and people they fancied because, as trainee lawyers on secure career tracks, life was good. Even conflicted Egg seemed to easily find a new career when he fancied one. </p> \n<p>Similarly, Peep Show’s Jeremy Usborne and Mark Corrigan, befuddled spokesmen for a slightly later generation, might have drifted from job to job, or had largely futile dreams of climbing the rungs of middle management’s rung, but their world is a largely benign place where marriage is a possibility and some employment achievable. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aec825b1e3b633c267ce7805adf19ed602dcab81\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435652264612/aa5bf416-a591-4992-9db8-1bf0b2a23336-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Danny (Sacha Dhawan) in Not Safe For Work.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Danny (Sacha Dhawan) in Not Safe For Work.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Sweeney/Channel 4</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Not Safe for Work, by contrast, features people who are struggling to hold it together. From Ashton’s efficient civil servant, Katherine, who uses her frosty manner to hide how broken she is inside, to the permanently smiling Jenny (Peaky Blinders’ Sophie Rundle), whose cheerfulness is almost a form of mania. </p> \n<p>“I really do feel as though everyone born after 1979 got a much, much rougher deal,” said Moore. “Not Safe for Work is really about someone who feels that their life is over before it had a chance to begin. If you look at the statistics the average first-time-buyer is now over 36. That’s crazy. </p> \n<p>“We’re constantly told that you should get a partner, have a kid, buy a house, and that defines how you live your life but what if you can’t do any of that? People who work in the private sector are completely loaded and on the fast track. They have their kids quicker. They buy houses earlier. Most people I know can’t do that.”</p> \n<p>Moore was also interested in looking at what happens when a generation finds itself unable to grow up. He wanted to address the realities of a generation that lives in a time of “quite extraordinary excess”.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2015/jun/16/trailer-watch-zawe-ashton-in-channel-4s-not-safe-for-work\">Trailer watch: Zawe Ashton in Channel 4's Not Safe for Work</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> “It’s almost as though we know we’re fucked in the long-term so we should be grateful for where we find pleasure. It feels like a very weird party that’s OK for the minute but won’t last. </p> \n<p>“It’s fine when you’re partying like that at 23 and still sorted at 25 but around 30 a few cracks can be seen and by 32 or 33 things are really starting to fracture and what used to seem fun now seems less so.”</p> \n<p>This elegy to struggling lives could be near-impossible to watch, but Moore undercuts the bleakness with wit and dark humour ensuring audiences are likely to laugh more than sigh. </p> \n<p>“I feel as though a whole generation is being done over and now the Tories are already talking about making the cuts more aggressive so it isn’t going to go away,” he said. “But at the same time there’s humour to be found in the bleakest moments.

At the Met in New York two years later, it was a different story; the production was picketed by hundreds of protestors and its first night was interrupted by boos and catcalls.

Die Meistersinger von N&uuml;rnberg – directed by Katharina Wagner, Bayreuth, 2007<br /></h2> \n<p>For her debut at the festival dedicated to the work of her great-grandfather Richard Wagner, Katharina directed a Meistersinger which had the audience making their displeasure clear. She updated the action, making the amateur singers of the title artists and manically typing poets, and subverted its hymn to the glories of German art with a sequence in which greats from Goethe to Wagner do a chorus-line routine. <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/31/arts/31iht-loomis.1.6912211.html\">“You left thinking you hadn’t really seen the opera,” concluded the New York Times</a>.</p> \n<h2>3.

After all that, however, the production received good reviews,with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2002/mar/23/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures\">the Guardian’s critic concluding</a>: “Bieito wants to heighten responses, to bring out what is buried, and that seems to me the primary responsibility of any opera director.”</p> \n<h2>4. Mazeppa – directed by David Alden, ENO, London 1984</h2> \n<p>Featuring bodies hung on meathooks, buckets of blood and an extremely graphic chainsaw massacre, Alden brought splatter-film aesthetics to Tchaikovsky’s opera and made his reputation as the opera world’s enfant terrible. “When the orgy of slashing closed the first act, I damned nearly threw up all over the chap sitting in front of me,” <a href=\"http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/5th-january-1985/26/opera\">said the Spectator’s critic</a>. “And the fact that he happened to be the ENO’s director of productions suggests that there may be justice in this world after all.”</p> \n<h2>5.

Sure enough, they booed heartily at Neuenfels’s interpretation, which depicted most of the opera’s characters as rats in a laboratory, with only the four main roles as fully human. While the audience may not have liked it, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/arts/music/05lohengrin.html\">the New York Times described the production as “provocative and insightful”</a>.</p> \n<h2>6. Eugene Onegin – directed by Dmitri Tcherniakov, Bolshoi, Moscow, 2006 and Royal Opera, London, 2010</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb7bef000dcb54101006253e04f9a85c7761941d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435690024452/680b6752-0f02-4aba-ba93-002058b838fc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bolshoi Opera's production of Eugene Onegin featuring Ekaterina Shcherbachenko as Tatiana and Andrew Goodwin as Lensky.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bolshoi Opera’s production of Eugene Onegin featuring Ekaterina Shcherbachenko as Tatiana and Andrew Goodwin as Lensky.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Damir Yusupov/PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Updating the opera to the 1960s and replacing the duel between Lensky and Onegin with a scene in which the former accidentally shoots himself, Tcherniakov provided a heightened take on Tchaikovsky in which, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2010/aug/13/eugene-onegin-bolshoi-review\">said our critic, “everything is pushed to neurotic extremes”</a> – though some found the opera barely recognisable.</p> \n<h2>7. Der Ring des Nibelungen – directed by Richard Jones, Royal Opera, London, 1994-96</h2> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/features/desecrating-wagner-roger-scruton\">Roger Scruton described Jones’s interpretation of opera’s most imposing work as a “desecration”</a>. The director put the Rhinemadens in Latex nude suits, depicted Freia, the goddess of youth, as a doll-clutching victim of arrested development and turned Wotan into the white-coated boss of a lunatic asylum. The Rhinegold itself was a bucket of women’s shoes: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/classical-music--joness-ring-far-from-gold-1443341.html\">“Foot-fetishism plays a major role in this production,” mused the Independent</a>.</p> \n<h2>8.

One scene saw naked actors lowered into gas chambers; another depicted Venus as an SS officer who forces Tannh&auml;user to commit murder. After the shock left some audience members in need of medical attention, <a href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/wagner-opera-cancelled-due-to-holocaust-staging-of-tannhaeuser-a-898937.html\">further performances were cancelled</a>. </p> \n<h2>9.

The Covent Garden audience, however, was distinctly unamused by an abstract and highly symbolic production in which, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2003/nov/10/classicalmusicandopera1\">the Guardian said</a>, “each character moves about the stage with studied deliberation, as if swimming through treacle.”</p> \n<h2>10.

One aria by Nicole-Smith’s son consisted of a list of drugs he was on, but the bad taste was intentional and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/culture/2011/feb/21/anna-nicole-smith-opera-royal\">the opera was well-received</a>. </p> \n<h2>11.

The 2004 production cemented his reputation as the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2004/aug/07/classicalmusicandopera\">“Quentin Tarantino of opera”</a>.</p> \n<h2>12.

Or the same day?</p>","byline":"Stephen Armstrong","body":"<p>Online shopping sits firmly in that sweet spot of extreme laziness and irritable impatience; it’s the only purchasing you can do lying down with doughnuts, but waiting for delivery is exasperating. So Amazon’s<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/jun/30/amazon-one-hour-deliveries-central-london\" title=\"\"> launch of Prime Now</a> – an initially London-based delivery service promising tens of thousands of items on the doorstep within 60 minutes – looked like a no fault winner. What could possibly go wrong?</p> \n<p>Typing Prime Now into Amazon’s online search field resulted in lists that included a selfie stick, a makeup brush, some arthritis bracelets, The Ultimate Candida Cleansing Treatment for Men and Women, a china jam pot with spoon, lots of books about the Labour party and the Paul Lamond Pizza Party Game. It was like browsing <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/politics/cherieblair\" title=\"\">Cherie Blair</a>’s bric-a-brac stall at the Bayswater sea scout fete.</p> \n<p>With a camping trip looming, I&nbsp;searched for toilet roll and an air bed – “toilet roll” delivered a sm&ouml;rg&aring;sbord of options from the Thumbs Up! $100 Bill novelty buttock wipes through 72 Rolls of Renova 3 Ply Lotion Skin Care Scented Toilet Tissue to, for some reason, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2013/oct/09/open-all-hours-reviving-classic-sitcom\" title=\"\">Open All Hours</a> DVD box set. I then had to click a box offering same-day delivery and found my options collapsing faster than the Greek banking industry. The best I could muster was a six-pack of Andrex. I opted for that, along with a Milestone Camping Single Flocked Air Bed in blue. After downloading the necessary app, the opening postcode checker said my EC1 address qualified only for two-hour delivery. Given that a visit to the Blacks at Holborn Circus might take considerably less time but required walking outside and enjoying the sun, I opted to live a Prime Now life. It was at this point that the app seemed to hit a HAL-style circular meltdown, offering me the delivery page where only an evening slot of 4pm-6pm was free.</p> \n<p>Each time I clicked, it flashed up: “Amazon Prime Now appears to be having trouble. Your items are still in your basket. Please try again.” After a frustrating 20 minutes, it suddenly warned me that the price of my items had changed and no longer hit the minimum &pound;20 spend. I added a&nbsp;notebook. Still my items stayed stuck in my basket. I believe this is known as a glitch.</p> \n<p>After close to half an hour I gave up and went back to the website, where I resigned to paying &pound;7.48 for same-day delivery, fractionally more than Amazon’s promise that “Prime Now customers can choose delivery within one hour of ordering for &pound;6.99, or free delivery within two-hour, slots between 8am and midnight.”</p> \n<p>Two hours later, the website mournfully told me, “No tracking information. We’re preparing your order. Carrier information will be updated soon”, and by 6pm my purchases still hadn’t arrived. Perhaps Prime Now isn’t quite the name they are looking for.</p>","section":"Money","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435685236897/30f96457-71d4-4226-873e-5bedf585c89f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Amazon package","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-30T18:01:33Z","lastModified":"2015-06-30T23:01:04Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":17,"contributors":[{"name":"Stephen Armstrong","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stephenarmstrong"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Online shopping","Amazon.com","Consumer affairs","Money","Internet","E-commerce","Technology"],"tags":[{"id":"money/online-shopping","webTitle":"Online shopping"},{"id":"technology/amazon","webTitle":"Amazon.com"},{"id":"money/consumer-affairs","webTitle":"Consumer affairs"},{"id":"money/money","webTitle":"Money"},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet"},{"id":"technology/efinance","webTitle":"E-commerce"},{"id":"technology/technology","webTitle":"Technology"}],"section":{"id":"money"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Stephen Armstrong","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stephenarmstrong"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"money"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/money/shortcuts/2015/jun/30/amazons-prime-now-one-hour-delivery-put-to-the-test","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a9fk","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/money/shortcuts/2015/jun/30/amazons-prime-now-one-hour-delivery-put-to-the-test","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/money/shortcuts/2015/jun/30/amazons-prime-now-one-hour-delivery-put-to-the-test"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435685236897/30f96457-71d4-4226-873e-5bedf585c89f-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Amazon’s Prime Now offers 60-minute delivery.
