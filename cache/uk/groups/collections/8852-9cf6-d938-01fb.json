Not a male Human Being or a female Human Being, but simply a Human Being,” he <a href=\"http://notch.tumblr.com/post/28188312756/gender-in-minecraft\">wrote in 2012 on his personal blog</a>.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>“The blocky shape gives it a bit of a traditional masculine look, but adding a separate female mesh would just make it worse by having one specific model for female Human Beings and male ones. That would force players to make a decisions about gender in a game where gender doesn’t even exist.”</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Steve’s unchallenged role as the default skin has not prevented Minecraft from amassing a huge audience that crosses the gender divide, particularly among children, where girls are as fervent Minecraft players as boys.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/apr/27/youtube-stampy-minecraft-education-wonder-quest\">YouTube backs digital star Stampy's new Minecraft show Wonder Quest</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>While players have been able to buy and download skins of other characters – Mojang’s Simpsons pack is launching for PlayStation players this week, too – making Alex a free default option is a significant move.</p> \n<p>It is also likely to spur more debate about whether the range of options could be widened further to, for example, provide options for different races.</p> \n<p>Mojang is holding its <a href=\"http://minecon.mojang.com/\">Minecon</a> conference in London at the start of July, which may see more announcements about how Minecraft will develop following the company’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2014/sep/15/microsoft-buys-minecraft-creator-mojang-for-25bn\">$2.5bn acquisition by Microsoft</a>.</p> \n<p>If nothing else, launching Alex on console editions of the game will give more attendees an alternative option to Steve if they’re planning to turn up in cosplay for the event.</p>","section":"Tech","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430222277672/e178ffcc-ff19-482f-b8f3-e56cdfc2728f-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"Minecraft's Alex skin will be made available to all starting players.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-04-28T13:52:28Z","lastModified":"2015-04-28T13:54:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":3,"contributors":[{"name":"Stuart Dredge","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/stuart-dredge"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Minecraft","Technology","Games","Game culture","Women","Culture","Gender","World news"],"topics":[{"displayName":"Stuart Dredge","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/stuart-dredge"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"technology"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/technology/2015/apr/28/minecraft-mojang-female-alex-character","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48v24","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/technology/2015/apr/28/minecraft-mojang-female-alex-character","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/28/minecraft-mojang-female-alex-character"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430222277672/e178ffcc-ff19-482f-b8f3-e56cdfc2728f-1020x612.png?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Minecraft’s Alex skin will be made available to all starting players.","credit":"PR","altText":"Minecraft's Alex skin will be made available to all starting players.","cleanCaption":"Minecraft’s Alex skin will be made available to all starting players."}},"importance":7,"kicker":{"title":"Minecraft"},"showQuotedHeadline":false},{"title":"Saturn's sponge-like moon captured in glorious detail","rawTitle":"Saturn's sponge-like moon captured in glorious detail","item":{"type":"article","id":"science/2015/apr/28/saturn-moon-hyperion-nasa-cassini-space-probe","title":"Saturn's sponge-like moon captured in glorious detail","trailText":"Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft snaps detailed image of crater-filled moon, which looks like a dodgy crumpet but is largely composed of water ice and rock","standFirst":"<p>Nasa’s Cassini spacecraft snaps detailed image of crater-filled moon, which looks like a dodgy crumpet but is largely composed of water ice and rock</p>","byline":"Press Association","body":"<p>It looks remarkably like a bath sponge floating in space, or perhaps a misshapen crumpet.

Peel and finely slice two cloves of garlic, add to the pan and cook for a minute or two until they turn pale gold. Pour in a litre of stock, vegetable or chicken, and bring to the boil. Tip in 400g of small brown or green lentils (I used le puy), let the stock return to the boil, then lower the heat and leave to simmer, partially covered with a lid, for about 35-40 minutes until the lentils are tender but just short of soft. Correct the seasoning with salt and black pepper. Blitz 50g of rocket leaves and 75g of pecorino together in a food processor until you have coarse, green and white crumbs. Spoon the lentils and sausages on to deep plates, then scatter the rocket and pecorino over the top, letting the cheese soften slightly with the heat of the lentils. Enough for 2.</p> \n<h2>The trick</h2> \n<p>I suggest checking the lentils every five minutes throughout their cooking time. Lentils vary in size, variety and, it has to be said, age, and take vastly different times to approach tenderness. I prefer to salt them towards the end of the cooking time, as occasionally an early salting seems to toughen them, as it can other dried pulses.</p> \n<h2>The twist</h2> \n<p>This recipe can be adapted to include thin strips of belly pork instead of sausages. Cut the pork into pencil- thick strips, cook briefly to crisp the fat, then continue as above.</p> \n<p>Follow the Observer Magazine on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/obsmagazine\">@ObsMagazine</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/22/1429722418236/Two-sausages-on-a-bed-of--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Two's company: lentils, sausages, rocket and pecorino.

He was on the campaign trail addressing a town hall meeting in Bristol, Virginia, when in the midst of his customary rhetorical flow, he lost momentum and ground to an inarticulate halt.</p> \n<p>“Everybody knows that it makes no sense … that you send a kid to the emergency room for a treatable illness like asthma, they end up taking up a hospital bed, it costs … when … if you … they just gave … you gave up a hospital bed, it costs … when … if you … they just gave… you gave ‘em treatment early and they got … some treatment … and … er … a breathalyser … or an inhalator … not a breathalyser … [audience laughter] … I haven’t had much sleep in the last 48 hours or so.”</p> \n<p>The reason for his unexpected collapse wasn’t biological; it was technical – his teleprompter had let him down. </p> \n<p>The incident had his critics foaming at the mouth. In their view, it proved beyond doubt that Obama was a sham because without a script and teleprompter to support his eloquence, he was as wooden as Pinocchio. </p> \n<p>Their reaction is not surprising, but is it justified? Spontaneity is regarded as one of the hallmarks of a great public speaker; but if you scratch beneath the surface you often find that, in the words of Oscar Wilde, “spontaneity is a meticulously prepared art”. </p> \n<p>One of the most effective rhetorical devices for creating the illusion of spontaneity in a prepared speech is called <em>metanoia</em> (also known as <em>correctio</em> and <em>epanorthosis</em>) – from the Greek meaning to change one’s mind. Two months after Obama’s autocue mishap, his vice-presidential running mate Joe Biden raised a laugh when he used metanoia in his <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/27/joe-biden-democratic-conv_n_121938.html\">speech to the Democratic convention</a>: </p> \n<p>“You know, folks, that’s the America that George Bush has left us.

But once a thing is said, even if it is taken back immediately, it can’t be unsaid: the impression it makes on an audience remains, undiminished. By correcting himself in mid-flow, Biden created the impression that he was thinking on his feet – quite an achievement for a politician whose own teleprompter gaffs have been well documented.</p> \n<p>In his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/books/2013/aug/16/leavis-snow-two-cultures-bust\">infamous Richmond lecture in Cambridge in 1962</a>, the distinguished literary critic FR Leavis launched an intemperate and vicious personal attack on fellow Cambridge academic and scientist CP Snow:</p> \n<p>“Snow is, of course, a – no, I can’t say that; he isn’t; Snow thinks of himself as a novelist … ”</p> \n<p>By drawing attention to the missing word, “novelist”, Leavis’s metanoia intensified his attack on Snow. And by inviting his audience to fill in the gap, he made them feel to some extent complicit in his unfolding diatribe. No one was left in any doubt that, as far as Leavis was concerned, Snow’s literary output was beneath contempt:</p> \n<p>“As a novelist he doesn’t exist; he doesn’t begin to exist. He can’t be said to know what a novel is.”</p> \n<p>The controversy sparked by the viciousness of Leavis’s attack reverberates to this day. </p> \n<p>In his <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/david-cameron/8046342/David-Camerons-Conservative-conference-speech-in-full.html\">2010 Tory conference speech</a>, David Cameron used metanoia to heap misery on to an already bowed and bloodied Labour opposition:</p> \n<p>“Let’s start by being honest with ourselves. The mess this country is in – it’s not all because of Labour. Of course, they must take some of the blame. All right – they need to take a lot of the blame. Let me just get this off my chest … ”</p> \n<p>A disruption in a formal speech is unexpected; it keeps an audience on its toes because it mirrors the spontaneity of everyday conversation, enabling the speaker to come out with something, pause, and then revise it to make it stronger, milder or clearer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"229e0b418fe001d57fab42ea5c39b0c53d0261ed\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430167534877/0ecd84ab-fe75-49a4-bc6e-ae3b67277768-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Abraham Lincoln: wrote the Gettysburg address at least five times before delivering it.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abraham Lincoln: wrote the Gettysburg address at least five times before delivering it.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: DEA Picture Library/De Agostini/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Finding fault with a speaker because of their dependence on notes, script and teleprompter betrays an ignorance of the mechanics of great oratory. <a href=\"http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/gettysburg.htm\">The Gettysburg address</a> is a mere 272 words long and takes less than three minutes to deliver, and yet there are five known copies of it in Lincoln’s own hand, one of which is the copy he read from on 19 November 1863.</p> \n<p>Winston Churchill dried up while giving a speech to the House of Commons in 1904. The experience shook him up so badly that from that day forward, he never gave a speech without using detailed notes. </p> \n<p>Speaking on the record demands careful consideration; every word matters, so it’s not a good time to busk.

It’s probably a reflection on me, not them,” he said of the E4 show about socialites. <br /></p> \n<p>Meanwhile he refused to hit back after Andrew Marr called Paxman’s technique “disdainful” and “contemptuous”. Marr called the rival broadcaster “a genuinely tortured, angry individual” after Paxman interviewed David Cameron and Ed Miliband in March.</p> \n<p>“You are not the first person to try to get me to be rude about him (Marr), and I’m not going to, I’m afraid,” Paxman said. He joked that it was for others to judge if he really was a tortured and angry individual. </p> \n<p>Paxman said of the general election: “I think it really matters ... I’ve no sympathy whatsoever with people who say ‘I don’t vote’.” <br /></p> \n<p>Of comedian Brand, who has encouraged people not to vote, he added: “I’m just astonished anyone would take that position seriously. It’s the position of an idiot.” </p> \n<p>Paxman added: “On the whole, I’m in favour of the state getting out of people’s lives, but I would not have a problem with voting being made compulsory. But if you did that, you’d have to have a box for ‘none of the above’.” </p> \n<p>He branded the choice at this election as being “between one man who was at primary school with Boris Johnson and one man who was at secondary school with him – both of whom did PPE at Oxford.”</p>","section":"Media","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/28/1430202056076/c02ebd5f-bbeb-4013-a6b8-5caf980dedd4-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Murdo Macleod/Murdo Macleod","altText":"Jeremy Paxman","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Murdo Macleod/Murdo Macleod"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-04-27T23:01:04Z","lastModified":"2015-04-28T06:21:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"John Plunkett","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/2/1399058779148/John-Plunkett-R.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/johnplunkett"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Jeremy Paxman","Television & radio","Television industry","Newsnight","General election 2015","Channel 4","BBC","Culture","Media","Politics","Television","UK news"],"topics":[{"displayName":"John Plunkett","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/johnplunkett"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"media"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/media/2015/apr/28/jeremy-paxman-itv-take-me-out-never-watches-newsnight","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/47qb7","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/media/2015/apr/28/jeremy-paxman-itv-take-me-out-never-watches-newsnight","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/apr/28/jeremy-paxman-itv-take-me-out-never-watches-newsnight"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/4/27/1430152619907/5cd4ab87-c858-477c-b680-1d9cdd477f0e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"David Mitchell and veteran BBC interrogator Jeremy Paxman, who will be hosting Channel 4’s Alternative Election Night on 7 May.
