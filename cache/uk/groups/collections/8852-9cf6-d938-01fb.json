It’s clearly struck a chord with George Miller as he reboots his low-budget 1979 road-warrior hit with more money, more trucks, and <em>much</em> more noise. Watching <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> is the cinematic equivalent of putting your head in the bass-bin at a death-metal concert where everything is turned up to eleventy-stupid. Hell, we even get sonic assault vehicles armed with drummers, speaker stacks and a mutant axe-man wielding an Ace Frehley-style guitar-slash-flamethrower. Add to this Finnish Eurovision winners Lordi’s wardrobe and a shooting/editing style designed to make you feel like you’ve been run over while being shouted at, and this insane post-apocalyptic pile-up runs little risk of understatement. Make no mistake, this is not a film of light and shade – it is an orgy of loud and <em>louder</em>, leaving us alternately exhilarated, exasperated and exhausted.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/nicholas-hoult-mad-max-fury-road-interview\">Mad Max’s Nicholas Hoult on hanging off lorries and channeling Andrex puppies</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Tom Hardy is Max Rockatansky, chased and imprisoned by the vampiric War Boys of Immortan Joe (one-time Toecutter Hugh Keays-Byrne), bolted into a post-Bane face mask and used as a human blood bag. This is a world in which water, oil and ammunition are currency, with a sideline in “mother’s milk” pumped from steam-punk contraptions that cross Terry Gilliam with Tinto Brass. Teaming up with renegade War Rig trucker Imperator Furiosa (Charlize Theron, sporting an <em>Alien<sup>3</sup></em>-era Ripley crop), Max and co strike out in search of “the Green Place” – a mystical land of mothers, a lush riposte to <em>Waterworld</em>’s elusive “DryLand”. Their cargo is a highly combustible cocktail of petrol and pregnancy, Joe’s enslaved wives (dressed in diaphanous floaties and <em>One Million Years BC</em> haute couture) making a bid for freedom from his breeding farm. En route, they encounter an array of variously hairy stilt-walking, motorbiking, chainsawing crazies, suggesting that a militarised wing of the French circus troupe Archaos has escaped into the desert and gone feral.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-456199977__\n</div> \n<p>While the first <em>Mad Max</em> was essentially a stripped-down Roger Corman revenge movie (high on concept, low on budget), this head-banging $150m fourth instalment – part (non)sequel, part reinvention – inclines more toward the retina-scorching, eardrum-bashing territory of Michael Bay, the casting of pouty <em>Transformers: Dark of the Moon </em>star Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as The Splendid Angharad setting talismanic alarm bells ringing. Yet while Bay’s CG-driven oeuvre has always lacked weight and substance, there’s a crunchy physicality about Miller’s balletic visual aesthetic – a belief that actions really do speak louder than words. Envisaged at one point as an <em>Akira</em>-style anime, this graphic-novel-inflected chase movie (co-written with British graphic-novelist/designer Brendan McCarthy and veteran Grease Rat/dramaturge Nico Lathouris) eschews dialogue in favour of explosive demonstration, the versatile <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3fsS2yNGkg\">“Edge Arm” camera system</a> – a swooping vehicle-mounted crane – providing a visual sword that cuts a defining swath through the narrative. Eye-catching Namib desert locales provide end-of-world backdrops, while layer-cake vehicle designs (cars bolted on to cars bolted on to trucks) turn everything into a mobile pile-up from the outset, with cheeky nods to Peter Weir’s influential <em>The Cars that Ate Paris</em>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/14/charlize-theron-mad-max-imperator-furiosa-feminist-icon\">Charlize Theron on Mad Max: ‘We live in a very toxic world’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Amid the car-nage, Tom Hardy is a fleshy cog in an oily machine, his intense physicality perfectly in keeping with Miller’s meat-grinder milieu. While Mel Gibson always had a touch of madness in his eyes (more so in retrospect), Hardy lets his bulky body do the talking, his muscular movements recalling the taut choreography of his title role in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2009/mar/15/drama\">Nicolas Winding Refn’s <em>Bronson</em></a>. By contrast, Theron’s one-armed bandit seems to be channelling the spirit of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2006/dec/31/melgibson.actionandadventure\">Gibson’s deranged <em>Apocalypto</em></a>, an oil-smear across her forehead signalling both petrol-head and tribal-warrior, her mechanical hand adding just a touch of <em>The Terminator</em>. Meanwhile Nicholas Hoult is all but unrecognisable as Nux, the tumour-ridden foot soldier who wants to chrome-plate his teeth and suicide-bomb his way into Valhalla, a misguided martyr in a very contemporary unholy war.</p> \n<p>If all this sounds like a reason to floor it to the nearest multiplex, then caution: there are obstacles in the road ahead. Putting the pedal to the metal for 90 minutes is one thing, but at two hours it’s more of a slog, battle-fatigue teetering on the edge of burn-out and even boredom. More problematically, for all its avowed feminist credentials Miller’s film can’t quite reconcile its horrors-of-patriarchy narrative with its exotic fashion-shoot depiction of “The Wives”, leaving its gender politics weirdly conflicted. But if you can work round such snarl-ups there’s plenty of mileage in this monster, which, significantly, was press-screened (and indeed shot) in 2D, with zero need for stereoscopic “enhancement”.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/13/1431531522793/mad-max-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nicholas Hoult as Nux in Mad Max: Fury Road: 'there’s a crunchy physicality about George Miller’s balletic visual aesthetic'.

Spoiler alert: Pat returned to work in episode 28.</p> \n<p>Anyway, it is also a lesson now learned by upstart operators who supposedly fancied cherry-picking Royal Mail’s more lucrative markets by delivering mail to our doors. Last week, Royal Mail’s only real rival in this market, the ridiculously named <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk-news/2015/may/11/whistl-post-delivery-service-suspended-possible-job-losses\" title=\"\">Whistl, effectively abandoned plans to deliver </a>to doorsteps after it couldn’t find anybody to fund its service.</p> \n<p>The announcement was terrible news for 2,000 or so Whistl employees now facing the axe but, conversely, rather welcome for Royal Mail workers worried about their jobs, and for the firm’s owners, with the shares shooting up by 3.9%.</p> \n<p>It was also nicely timed for the postal service’s annual meeting this week, although it all comes too late for Pat: he was dropped from Royal Mail marketing campaigns in 2000, as he no longer fitted its “corporate image”.</p> \n<h2>Extra-curricular activities<br /></h2> \n<p>If you are the type who employs a City broker, and have sometimes wondered exactly how hard they’re grafting on your behalf for those chunky fees, here’s a fun game to play.</p> \n<p>Give them a call to see if they’re in the office this week. Repeat the exercise on 5 June, any time between 16 and 20 June, then again for a couple of weeks from the end of June. The chances are you might keep missing your broker, who will be extremely busy having meetings with other clients, none of whom could make it into the City.</p> \n<p>In case you’re curious, those meetings will probably be taking place this week at the Chelsea Flower Show, the Lord’s Test match and (possibly) Wentworth, where the PGA golf is teeing off. Your broker will then be dragged over to Epsom for the Investec Oaks on 5 June, followed by Royal Ascot (16-20 June) and Wimbledon (29 June-12 July) – which should have ensured that everybody is in peak bubbly-quaffing form to return to St John’s Wood for more crucial negotiations, which will need to take place during the Ashes Test in the middle of July.</p> \n<p>Life is grand, isn’t it?</p> \n<h2>Frozen in</h2> \n<p>In the peerless 1983 comedy film <em>Trading Places</em>, Eddie Murphy’s character, loudmouthed down-and-out Billy Ray Valentine, is banged up in a police cell after being accused of attempted robbery. An officer suddenly arrives and tells him: “Move it: you made bail,” to which a startled Valentine replies: “I did?”</p> \n<p>This seems like the polar opposite to the situation of Navinder Singh Sarao, the British trader fighting extradition to the US after being arrested last month for allegedly spoofing financial markets and supposedly contributing to the 2010 “flash crash”. Unlike Valentine, he seems to be incredibly rich and discreet, having allegedly made &pound;27m but still being the sort who waits for a supermarket to mark down its sandwiches before buying lunch.</p> \n<p>So you can imagine that when Singh was told he hadn’t made bail, he might have responded: “I didn’t?” – seeing as he thought he had &pound;5m in a trading account for that purpose. But it transpired that those monies, along with all the rest of Sarao’s funds, have been frozen by the US authorities, making it an offence to touch them. Lawyers explained this to the magistrate, to no avail, meaning Sarao’s been in custody for almost four weeks. He goes to the high court this week to get the conditions altered.</p>","section":"UK","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2015/5/15/1431698737675/Royal-Mail-van-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The departure of Whistl leaves Royal Mail jobs safer and its share price higher.

The girl, Marie-Laure, had become blind by the age of six. Her father is a locksmith who works at the Museum of Natural History. As his daughter’s sight finally fails, her father builds her a model of Paris, and in this way she is able to navigate around the city.

Their first cookbook, <em>The Art of Eating Well</em>, features roasted bone marrow, osso buco and a hunking great steak, fried in ghee or duck fat and served with a mustard leek sauce. In fact, you have to read many of their recipes very closely to realise they have any connection with eating virtuously. Hemsley &amp; Hemsley do fried chicken, just with almonds in place of breadcrumbs and oven-baked; their shepherd’s pie is topped with cauliflower mash.</p> \n<p>At the heart of many of their dishes is “<a href=\"http://www.hemsleyandhemsley.com/recipe/bone-broth/\">bone broth</a>” – stock, really, but cooked slower and longer than many of us have the patience for. It’s an old-fashioned idea, but the Hemsleys are bringing it back into fashion. “Bone broth is one of the oldest foods: it’s a food for the sick and the weak, it’s a food for the old and the young, anyone who’s got digestive issues,” says Jasmine. Their secret is a long, slow cook: a chicken carcass gets at least six hours; beef bones bubble away for up to a full day. “It has to gel,” adds Melissa, “like a wobbly thigh.”</p> \n<p>Since 2012, the sisters have blogged <a href=\"http://www.vogue.co.uk/person/hemsley-plus-hemsley\">for the Vogue website</a>; <em>The Art of Eating Well,</em> published last summer, has scarcely left the top 10 lists. “We’re really meat and two veg,” explains Jasmine, a former model, with a smile – it’s just the veg is likely to be rainbow coleslaw or carrots <a href=\"http://www.hemsleyandhemsley.com/product/hemsley-hemsley-spiralizer/\">twirled through a spiraliser</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>What’s their ethos: </strong>“People are now like: ‘Why can’t I have it all? Why can’t food be delicious and good for me,’” says Melissa. “And the proof is in the pudding – literally. If the food didn’t taste good, people would stop making it, stop buying it and they’d move on. But because there’s fat in it, this is the food they want to eat. It’s the food I want to eat, anyway.”</p> \n<p><strong>How they got started: </strong>Their mother is Filipino and has inspired a number of their recipes; their father was a lieutenant colonel in the British army. The sisters remember at least eight houses and seven schools across England and in Germany. But the biggest influence was when Jasmine started modelling after school. “Counting calories wasn’t really my era,” she recalls. “It was more like skipping meals. So I started bringing my own food to shoots because you don’t know what you’re going to get. People would always make fun: ‘Are you eating butter? That’s not allowed, is it?”<br /></p> \n<p>Word, however, of her exotic packed lunches spread, and in 2010 Jasmine began to prepare meals for private clients, mainly in fashion and entertainment. She soon had so much work that she brought in Melissa, who was then working in marketing for a chain of gastropubs. They share all duties now, although Jasmine likes to bake while Melissa takes the lead on curries.</p> \n<h2>Hemsley and Hemsley’s sesame chicken salad with cucumber noodles</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"522a181117fb994ae27e40a638e3e995d6f000f7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431444647211/5495806a-a495-42c6-9809-c9c7cc998372-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hemsley &amp; Hemsley’s Sesame Chicken Salad with Cucumber Noodles\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hemsley &amp; Hemsley’s Sesame Chicken Salad with Cucumber Noodles</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is a refreshing summer salad with cucumber noodles and Asian flavours. And it is the perfect way to use up leftover chicken. If you have no leftover chicken, serve instead with a little fish or sliced seared beef. We love raw chopped pak choi, but you can substitute with Chinese-style cabbage or finely shredded English cabbage. Eat this within a few hours as the cucumber will start to get watery, or make everything else up in advance and prepare the cucumber noodles just before serving.<br /></p> \n<p>If you’re taking this for lunch, pack the chicken first, then arrange all the veg on top so they don’t get squashed, and take your dressing in a separate jar.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br />For the salad<br /><strong>black or white sesame seeds </strong>2tbsp<br /><strong>cucumbers </strong>2<br /><strong>romaine or cos lettuce</strong> 1 small head, shredded into ribbons<br /><strong>pak choi </strong>1 small head or <strong>Chinese cabbage </strong>150g, shredded into ribbons<br /><strong>spring onions</strong> 3, thinly sliced<br /><strong>fresh coriander</strong> a handful, roughly chopped<br /><strong>cooked chicken</strong> 250g, shredded<br /><strong>red chilli </strong>1, finely chopped, to garnish (optional)</p> \n<p>For the sesame dressing<br /><strong>sesame oil (not toasted) or extra virgin olive oil </strong>5 tbsp<br /><strong>toasted sesame oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>lime</strong> juice of 1 or <strong>lemon juice</strong> 3 tbsp<br /><strong>raw runny honey</strong> 2 tsp<br /><strong>tamari or sea salt</strong> 1 tsp</p> \n<p>Gently toast the sesame seeds in a dry pan until fragrant. Use a spiraliser or julienne peeler to make the cucumber noodles. Or use a regular vegetable peeler to slice the cucumbers lengthways into wide pappardelle-style ribbons. You might want to cut the long, spiralised strands in half to make them easier to eat.<br /></p> \n<p>Prepare the dressing by whisking together all the ingredients in a bowl or shaking them together in a jam jar. Add the lettuce, pak choi, spring onion and coriander to a bowl. Pour over the dressing and mix everything together.</p> \n<p>Plate up with some shredded chicken, and top with toasted sesame seeds and the red chilli, if using. Serve immediately.</p> \n<p>No leftover chicken? Just roast 2 large chicken thighs at fan 200C/gas mark 6 for 25-30 minutes until cooked, then shred quickly with two forks to cool the meat quickly.<br /></p> \n<p><em>Extracted from The Art of Eating Well by Melissa Hemsley &amp; Jasmine Hemsley (Ebury Press, &pound;25). <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/art-of-eating-well.html\">Click here t</a></em><em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/art-of-eating-well.html\">o order a copy for &pound;20 from the Guardian Bookshop</a></em><br /></p> \n<h2><strong>Ella Woodward</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"daadfa18a30de67db92eb58daa028320c68e5cb5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431444820686/7182f913-e0b1-4737-b8fc-9aec02551411-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Ella Woodward.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ella Woodward.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Phil Fisk for Observer Food Monthly</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong><a href=\"http://deliciouslyella.com/\">Deliciously Ella</a></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Who: </strong><em>Deliciously Ella</em> is, simply, the food-publishing phenomenon of 2015. Four years ago, 23-year-old Ella Woodward was a university student who couldn’t cook. Really, scarcely boil an egg: “I hated fruit, I hated vegetables, I’d never eaten brown rice and I lived off pick ’n’ mix,” she says. Now her recipe collection, <em>Deliciously Ella,</em> which came out in January, is the fastest-selling debut cookbook ever, spending six weeks at No 1 in the charts. Her blog receives 6 million hits a month and she has 400,000 followers on Instagram. Not bad for someone who has never cooked in a restaurant and has no TV presence.<br /></p> \n<p>Woodward’s food is unfussy, mostly quick to prepare and generous. She avoids labels such as vegan – she doesn’t touch meat, dairy, gluten or sugar herself, but unlike some others featured here, she is happy to include pasta or rice (very occasionally) in her recipes. “It’s just about trying to put the vegetable in the middle of the dish,” she explains. But perhaps the main reason for <em>Deliciously Ella’s</em> success is Woodward’s own story: she suffered from<a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/postural-tachycardia-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx]\"> postural tachycardia syndrome, </a>which can cause debilitating nausea, dizziness and blurred vision. She was laid up in bed for almost a year and says her change in diet – along with exercise – has been a <a href=\" http://www.patient.co.uk/health/postural-tachycardia-syndrome-pots-leaflet\">key part of her recovery</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>What’s her ethos?: </strong>“There’s a preconception this food is weird and different,” says Woodward. “I wanted to do it in a way that was as simple as possible, with an ingredients list and method that was as short as possible, and make it taste good and not be terrifying.”</p> \n<p><strong>How she got started: </strong>Rock bottom for Woodward came when she took a trip to Morocco with her boyfriend before her illness had been diagnosed. The trip lasted less than 24 hours before she had to return home on a drip with food poisoning.</p> \n<p>At the time, Woodward was an art student at St Andrews University and recently signed to the Models 1 agency. She imagined a future living with her parents – Labour MP Shaun Woodward and Camilla Sainsbury, the supermarket heiress – never going out. “If you said to me at the time, ‘This is going to be a great thing for you,’ I’d have punched you in the face,” says Woodward. “But it’s been the best accident ever.”</p> \n<p>By far the most popular recipe on Woodward’s blog and in her book are brownies made from sweet potatoes and dates. “They were a mistake,” Woodward admits. “I had loads of steamed sweet potato in the fridge and I just blended it with stuff I always have: dates, cacao, maple syrup and stuff.”</p> \n<p>The brownies are the perfect expression of Woodward’s approach. “I still don’t eat bland salads and iceberg lettuce,” she says. “I want to make things we want to eat, just healthier.”</p> \n<h2>Ella Woodward’s sweet potato brownies</h2> \n<p>These brownies have consistently been the most popular recipe on my blog. And there’s a good reason for all this love – the brownies are divine. I know it sounds strange to put vegetables into sweet dishes, but sweet potatoes taste more like dessert anyway and they create the gooiest consistency.<br /></p> \n<p>If you don’t have any raw cacao powder, then you can use conventional cocoa powder, but you’ll need to at least double the quantity.</p> \n<p>Makes 10-12 brownies<br /><strong>sweet potatoes</strong> 2 medium-large (600g)<br /><strong>Medjool dates</strong> 14, pitted<br /><strong>ground almonds</strong> 80g<br /><strong>buckwheat or brown rice flour </strong>100g<br /><strong>raw cacao powder</strong> 4 tbsp<br /><strong>maple syrup</strong> 3 tbsp<br /><strong>salt</strong> a pinch</p> \n<p>Preheat the oven to 180C/gas mark 4. Peel the sweet potatoes. Cut them into chunks and place into a steamer for about 20 minutes, until they become really soft.</p> \n<p>Once they are perfectly soft and beginning to fall apart, remove them and add them to a food processor with the pitted dates. Blend until a smooth, creamy mix forms.</p> \n<p>Put the remaining ingredients into a bowl, before mixing in the sweet potato and date combination. Stir well.</p> \n<p>Place the mix into a lined baking dish and cook for about 20-30 minutes, until you can pierce the brownie cake with a fork and bring it out dry.</p> \n<p>Remove the tray and allow it to cool for about 10 minutes. This is really important, as the brownies need this time to stick together.</p> \n<p><em>&copy; Ella Woodward.

In the introduction to her 2014 book, <em>A Modern Way to Eat</em>, she explained that “flavour, above anything else, informs my cooking”: that’s why if she thinks a recipe needs butter or sugar or white flour – three of the great evils of the new health movement – that’s exactly what she will (sparingly) use.</p> \n<p>Jones’s first kitchen job came as part of the original intake at Jamie Oliver’s Fifteen project, and after that she worked for another seven years following Oliver around school canteens and America’s most obese towns. Jones clearly learned a lot about creating dazzling yet deceptively simple food, and she has also embraced Oliver’s don’t-be-too-hard-on-yourself mentality. <em>A Modern Way to Eat</em> is, Jones concedes, a grand title – one that is at odds with its modest author. But the book, already on its fifth print run, could be quietly revolutionary. It is vegetarian but so indulgent, unfussy and satisfying that even carnivores will soon forget that fact.</p> \n<p><strong>What’s her ethos: </strong>“I really believe we need to eat in a balanced way,” says Jones. “We don’t need to vilify any foods, we don’t need to boost any foods to these ridiculous, almost god-like positions where they are going to cure everything that we do. For me, eating should be about a joyful, shared experience.”</p> \n<p><strong>How she got started: </strong>Seven years ago, Jones decided to try vegetarianism – just for six weeks, to see how she felt. She was working with Oliver at the time and initially she decided not to tell her colleagues. “There was this feeling that you weren’t worth your stripes unless you were ready to cook a pig snout,” Jones explains, “so it actually felt I was uttering a swear word when I said: ‘I’m vegetarian.’”</p> \n<p>The experiment turned out to be a surprising one: not only did Jones feel healthier and have more energy, she found her food was becoming more creative and exciting, not less. “It opened a whole new world,” she says. “Cooking seemed to have lots more dimensions, because I was thinking about layering flavour and texture with pops of citrus, chilli and heat. I was satisfying my palate in a completely different way.”</p> \n<p>One of the dishes that epitomise this new approach is called “<a href=\"http://annajones.co.uk/recipe/really-hungry-burger\">the Really Hungry Burger”</a> – a reimagining of the maligned veggie burger. The patty is made from a blend of portobello mushrooms, dates, white beans, tahini and soy, topped with avocado and pickled cucumber. And Jones is happy to look the other way if you want to serve it with her sweet potato fries. “There was always a definite worthiness attached to vegetarianism,” she says. “Hopefully this allows people to accept it in a way that isn’t saying, ‘I remember my mum’s vegetarian mate who used to wear the weird purple trousers.’”</p> \n<h2>Anna Jones’s warm salad of roasted kale, coconut and tomatoes</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"efa3704673950dc6dd1950955279448cb2808b85\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431445381656/618deb04-b3ac-4c65-9421-0cb400884198-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Warm salad of roasted kale, coconut and tomatoes.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Warm salad of roasted kale, coconut and tomatoes.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Roasting this wonderful brassica gives a deep savoury flavour and an amazing crunchy texture, not too far away from the Chinese restaurant crispy seaweed of my childhood.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>cherry tomatoes</strong> 400g<br /><strong>sea salt<br /></strong><strong>freshly ground black pepper<br /></strong><strong>olive oil </strong>a drizzle<br /><strong>unwaxed limes </strong>2<br /><strong>green or purple kale </strong>1 head (about 200g), stalks removed, leaves roughly torn into bite-size pieces<br /><strong>unsweetened shaved or desiccated coconut</strong> a handful<br /><strong>soy sauce or tamari </strong>1 tbsp</p> \n<p>For the dressing<br /><strong>fresh ginger</strong> a thumb-sized piece, peeled and finely chopped<br /><strong>white miso paste </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>tahini </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>honey or agave syrup </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>coconut or olive oil </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>red chilli </strong>1, finely chopped</p> \n<p>Preheat your oven to 220C/gas mark 7.

Tempting but probably too simplistic. “Denmark is the land of dairy and pork and potatoes – none of which I eat,” explains Britton, 32, who was born in Toronto. She also points out that she started her blog <a href=\"http://www.mynewroots.org/site/\">My New Roots</a> in 2007, a couple of years before she came to Europe, following a Dane, Mikkel, whom she’d met in New York City.</p> \n<p>Britton is a graduate of the Institute of Holistic Nutrition in Toronto (she can practise as a nutritionist in Canada, but her qualification is not recognised by the medical community). She cooks mostly with ghee, never olive oil; her recipes are vibrant, heavy on “superfoods” and ruthlessly seasonal. Her recent cookbook, also called <em>My New Roots</em>, is in fact divided into five seasons: after working on a farm – and in common with the Chinese – she splits summer into “early” and “late”.</p> \n<p><strong>What’s her ethos: </strong>“As much as I feel passionately about plant-based whole foods, I’m relaxed about it as well,” says Britton. “Food should be divine and sensual and sexy and awesome.”</p> \n<p><strong>How she got started: </strong>Britton was a chef in a vegetarian restaurant in Copenhagen when, in 2010, Mikkel had a hang-gliding accident. “He’s fine now, but it was three months of me feeding him, bathing him and everything else. We had a lot of time to talk: what do we really want out of our lives together?”</p> \n<p>Britton decided to leave her job and concentrate on My New Roots. Steadily, her readership grew and then one day a recipe launched the site into the “blog stratosphere”… <a href=\"http://www.mynewroots.org/site/2013/02/the-life-changing-loaf-of-bread/\">The Life-Changing Loaf of Bread</a> is a dense, chewy loaf of nuts, seeds and gluten-free rolled oats bound together by psyllium seed husks. Since it originally appeared in February 2013, the post has received 1,500 comments.</p> \n<p>“When you become healthier, you really should give up white bread,” says Britton. It’s not that bread is “bad”, she insists, but too often it can form the basis of all three meals. “But this bread convinced people there was this wonderful alternative.”</p> \n<h2>Sarah Britton’s sprouted wild rice with pistachios and spring vegetables</h2> \n<p>Sprouting wild rice is a simple and delicious way to enjoy this amazing food completely raw. The process of sprouting wild rice is called “blooming” because the seeds actually unfold, very much like little petals, revealing the pale, tender insides. It’s a really fun thing to watch, however slowly, and it’s groovy to eat something you’ve seen transform over a few days.</p> \n<p>This salad combines fresh springtime tastes and textures, all sauced up with a delicious dressing featuring bright lemon and spicy mustard. The herbs add the final layer of flavour, making this a salad that truly tastes alive! Because the rice is sprouted, it is very sweet, requiring salt in the salad – make sure to season it well to suit your own taste.</p> \n<p>Serves 4<br /><strong>wild rice</strong> 200g (makes 300g sprouted rice)<br /><strong>cold-pressed olive oil</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>strong mustard</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>organic lemon</strong> 1, zested<br /><strong>freshly squeezed lemon juice</strong> 2 tbsp<br /><strong>pure maple syrup</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>fine sea salt<br /></strong><strong>shelled green peas</strong> 300g<br /><strong>cooked chickpeas</strong> 165g<br /><strong>spring carrots</strong> 4, julienned<br /><strong>fresh chives</strong> 7g, chopped<br /><strong>fresh dill</strong> 7g, chopped<br /><strong>raw pistachios</strong> 40g , roughly chopped</p> \n<p>Rinse the rice well, put it in a glass jar or bowl, and cover with fresh, pure water. Let it soak on the countertop overnight. In the morning, drain and rinse the rice; then cover it again with fresh water and put the jar in the fridge. Drain and rinse the rice at least twice per day for 2 to 3 days, until it has “bloomed” when it should be tender enough to eat. Drain and rinse and put it in a large bowl.</p> \n<p>Whisk the olive oil, mustard, lemon zest and juice, and maple syrup together in a small bowl, adding a few pinches of sea salt. Pour half of the dressing over the rice and fold to coat. Stir the raw peas, chickpeas, carrots, and herbs into the rice.</p> \n<p>In a dry frying pan over a medium heat, toast the pistachios until golden and fragrant, about 5 minutes (be careful not to burn them). Add the toasted nuts to the salad. Pour the remaining dressing over and fold to combine. Serve.</p> \n<p><em>Extracted from My New Roots by Sarah Britton (Macmillan, &pound;20). <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/274811/\">Click here to buy a copy for &pound;16 from Guardian Bookshop</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431444575058/ff8d6a59-b153-46bb-9dba-9463a499aefe-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Phil Fisk for Observer Food Monthly","altText":"Melissa and Jasmine Hemsley","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Phil Fisk for Observer Food Monthly"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431444648852/5495806a-a495-42c6-9809-c9c7cc998372-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hemsley &amp; Hemsley’s Sesame Chicken Salad with Cucumber Noodles Photograph: PR","credit":"PR","altText":"Hemsley & Hemsley’s Sesame Chicken Salad with Cucumber Noodles","cleanCaption":"Hemsley &amp; Hemsley’s Sesame Chicken Salad with Cucumber Noodles","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"},{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431444822047/7182f913-e0b1-4737-b8fc-9aec02551411-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Ella Woodward.

Binoche plays Maria Enders, a middle-aged actress revisiting the iconic play in which she once embodied Sigrid, a young woman who seduces and then destroys her boss, Helena. Now, she is being asked to play the older role, with Lindsay Lohan-esque rising star – and celebrity clickbait – Jo-Ann Ellis (Chlo&euml; Grace Moretz) stepping into Sigrid’s shoes. Holed up in recently deceased playwright Wilhelm Melchior’s Alpine home, Maria and her young assistant, Valentine (Kristen Stewart, terrific), undertake line readings of the play, Maloja Snake. The distinction between what is read and what is real fades ever further as the play reflects and refracts their own interpersonal lives.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/film/2015/may/10/juliette-binoche-sils-marie--interview-ruthless-depardieu-wanted-to-kill-me\">Juliette Binoche: 'Depardieu wanted to kill me.

Although the discussions of the acting process suffer from a surfeit of theatricality, there’s nothing artificial about the sparks that fly between Binoche and Stewart. The breathtaking scenery (amid which Nietzsche wrote that “everything returns”) lends an otherworldly air, but the push-and-pull between Maria and Valentine is intimate and domestic, mirror-image themes emphasised without overstatement.</p> \n<p>Assayas is less sure how to handle Jo-Ann – the clips of her latest sci-fi blockbuster look more like archaic outtakes from <em>Battlestar Galactica</em>, and her viral internet presence is depicted with what is clearly an outsider’s eye. Yet Moretz has the measure of the role and fills in the blanks with subtlety and wit, leaving Stewart and Binoche to work their career-best magic.</p>","section":"Film","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431607036202/clouds-of-sils-maria-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Juliette Binoche as Maria in Clouds of Sils Maria, a role created for her.

I felt like I had to see what all the fuss was about and pick up the book from my school library. </p>\n<p>On Amy and Nick's fifth anniversary, Amy goes missing. With a seemingly staged crime scene in their living room and mopped up blood in the kitchen, all fingers point towards Nick. He swears their relationship was fine, but the media is turning on him and his portrayal of the anguished husband is unconvincing.</p>\n<p>I was thoroughly impressed with this book from start to finish. I've read a few books with some pretty tense, twisting plotlines, but none as well written and exciting as this! There were too many revelations and sudden plot twists to count, though the main one was introduced earlier than I would have expected. </p>\n<p>I love how Gillian Flynn plays with your perceptions of Nick and Amy, even at the end I wasn't quite sure how I felt about each of them. Nick is an especially interesting character, during his narrative you are never quite sure whether you can trust him. </p>\n<p>Gone Girl explores their marriage psychologically, examining how they reacted to each other's &quot;real&quot; selves. The ending was not as explosive as I had expected and I'm still not sure whether it provided closure. It's been a while since I physically could not put down a book as the temptation to read on was too great. I highly recommend this book to anyone with a passion for thrillers or murder mysteries.
