Rain and spray sting my cheeks and branches snag and scratch me. I’ve drifted from the imaginary line in the middle of the river and am gathering enough foliage to camouflage a tank.</p> \n<p>The Alps may be more associated with winter action breaks, but it’s August and I’m in the mountain village of Chaillol in the southern French Alps for a week’s adventure with my wife Tracey and sons Jacob, 7, and Joe, 10. Kayaking on the frothing Severaisse river certainly has the adrenaline pumping.</p> \n<p>“You love the trees, don’t you Richard?” says Sylvain, our instructor, with a broad grin, as I study yet more Alpine flora. Joe, sharing a kayak with another instructor, whoops all the way, while my kayak flips over momentarily and I emerge soaked but exhilarated.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42ecdbe0644a9fd8693bb9e66557edfbd5af0b46\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434722546340/04ac9698-62b5-4099-85cc-1a02cd73290f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kayaking is one of the holiday’s activity options – others nclude tubing and mountain hiking\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kayaking is one of the holiday’s activity options – others nclude tubing and mountain hiking</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kayaking is just one option on the itinerary, organised by Undiscovered Alps, that has included activities from tubing to mountain hiking. An hour’s drive from our chalet in Chaillol is the man-made Lac de Serre-Pon&ccedil;on, Western Europe’s largest lake and a playground for French families. We spend an afternoon being dragged around by a speedboat on biscuit-shaped inflatables – and Jacob declares it the best day of his life.</p> \n<p>Before hitting the winding road through mist back to Chaillol at 1,600m, we stop at cheese-lovers’ paradise, the Laiterie du Col Bayard. I tuck into its speciality <em>assiette du Champsaur</em> – a delicious and filling selection of local hams and cheeses, salads and pastry, while the boys munch their way through crepes.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1355b611f75121484b3efe4f31ca946be5a15730\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434722843887/05c3c85a-5e0e-4baf-b9a1-1faa835becf5-382x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Richard Lakin’s sons loved their summer activity break.\" width=\"382\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Lakin’s sons loved their summer activity break.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Lakin</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Next morning the sun has scorched the mist away and the valley and mountains unfold before us as we head to Jungle Laye, an adventure park an hour away in the small ski resort of Laye. Joe takes to the high ropes with ease, scrambling up cargo nets, whistling down zipwires and swinging from platform to platform in the towering pines.</p> \n<p>Our final activity is a climb to Refuge du Tourond, at an altitude of 1,712m on the edge of the Ecrins national park. It can only be reached on foot. From the hamlet of les Fermons, we make our way up a steep path past boulders the size of sheds and trees uprooted by melting snow. The walk takes two hours with stops to guzzle water, admire bursts of speckled butterflies and waggle our tired toes in the streams. We get a dorm to ourselves before joining English and French families to dine on herby soup and plates heaped with gammon, pasta, spinach and cheese.</p> \n<p>Sweaters are pulled on as the sun retreats behind the peaks and we gaze out of our window at mountains now black as felt and topped with shimmering starlight. The chatter of crickets is incessant and loud as an orchestra, like nature’s television set left on standby – the perfect end to a week of adrenaline, cheese and fun-filled family adventure.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Activities and accommodation were provided by Undiscovered Alps (0845 009 8501, </em><a href=\"http://www.undiscoveredalps.com/\"><em>undiscoveredalps.com</em></a><em>), which has a week in Chaillol with all activities for about €432 adult, €361 child.

The headache was bad enough, but the nausea and lethargy made you feel as if you had been poisoned. Yet, when you had done the same thing two months before, it hadn’t felt this bad, even though you had drunk the same amount of wine and avoided the usual culprits (the spirits, such as brandy and whisky, with their particularly toxic chemicals). What was worse, your friend, who drank even more than you, felt fine. The usual excuse is to blame the after-effects on bad luck, or your genes, but could there be other culprits?</p> \n<p>Hangovers occur due to the side-effects of the chemical produced when alcohol is broken down. Alcohol itself is fairly harmless – but enzymes convert it to acetaldehyde, which does&nbsp;the damage. The longer the acetaldehyde hangs around, the worse you and your liver feel. Other enzymes help to clear the acetaldehyde away, but the rates at which both happen are extremely variable in different people.</p> \n<p>Many east Asian people carry a&nbsp;mutation in a gene that increases the&nbsp;speed at which acetaldehyde is formed. This means that, compared with Caucasians, they suffer more side-effects from boozing, such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_flush_reaction\" title=\"\">flushing</a> and nausea. There are also more subtle gene variants that alter how much acetaldehyde an individual can produce and how fast they can eliminate it.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25098862\" title=\"\">A study of more than 4,000 twins in Australia</a> has shown that susceptibility to hangovers has a major genetic component. Other twins studies have shown that liking or disliking the taste of alcohol, the amount of drinking, and alcohol addiction are strongly heritable traits. So clearly the <a href=\"http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa18.htm\" title=\"\">genes that control these enzymes are important</a> – but they are not the whole story.</p> \n<p>Last year, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0096864\" title=\"\">a US study explored for the first time what binge drinking did to our microbes</a>. Twenty-five healthy volunteers who were not regular drinkers were given a wine glass of vodka. There was a wide variety in response: those with the worst symptoms and changes in blood tests had the highest levels of toxins coming from the cell walls of their gut microbes. These toxins (called LPS) had somehow leaked out of their intestines, as a result of the inflammation the alcohol had produced. Within their guts the alcohol produced a brief, but large increase in the microbe species that were pro-inflammatory, stimulating the immune system as if it were under attack and contributing to the general sick-feeling so typical of hangovers.</p> \n<p>Population studies, such as the American gut project, show that low to moderate alcohol intake can actually increase your microbial diversity, which is usually beneficial for your health. One of my own researchers (I’m&nbsp;a professor of genetic epidemiology at King’s College London) diligently experimented on her own microbes by&nbsp;drinking three pints of beer each evening for five days. Her 5,000 or so gut microbes overall did not change, but a few species increased markedly –&nbsp;one relatively unknown one called <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23606477\" title=\"\">Erysipelotrichia</a> increased five-fold. When she looked at its possible function from its genes, she found it could produce alcohol dehydrogenase – the enzyme that breaks down alcohol to acetaldehyde. So, as she was drinking her beer and feeling increasingly tired and lethargic, her alcohol-loving microbe species were busy reproducing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/australia-food-blog/2015/apr/03/how-to-cope-with-if-not-cure-your-public-holiday-hangover-with-food\">How to cope with, if not cure, your public holiday hangover with food</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>So, drinking too much alcohol actually causes toxins to be released from our microbes, as well as growing more microbe-loving alcohol species. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22405477\" title=\"\">Studies have also shown</a> that when mice are fed these toxins, they seek out more alcohol than normal mice, suggesting that the microbes, via their toxins, could actually be encouraging us to seek out even more alcohol and – worryingly – even lead to addiction.</p> \n<p>If our microbes are part of the problem – what happens if we eliminate them? Experiments making mice binge-drink like humans produced signs of liver damage – again because of the toxins, leaky gut and inflammation. <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2180/14/240\" title=\"\">When the researchers repeated the experiment</a> in mice lacking microbes, they found no evidence of liver damage. Going back to their normal binge-drinking mice, the scientists tried feeding them a high-fibre diet (enriched with pectin found in apples) as well as alcohol shots, and compared this to a low-fibre diet. The high-fibre-fed mice amazingly had virtually no obvious side-effects from the alcohol on their livers. <a href=\"http://www.journalofdairyscience.org/article/S0022-0302(14)00097-6/abstract\" title=\"\">Similar preventive effects were seen</a> on mice given probiotics containing beneficial microbes such as&nbsp;lactobacillus, found in cheese and yoghurt. Even <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25239591\" title=\"\">saturated fat counteracted the harmful effects</a> of the alcohol on microbes.</p> \n<p>Although the jury is still out on whether drinking small amounts regularly is beneficial, overdoing alcohol is obviously bad for you. It causes major disruption to your gut microbes directly – and heavy drinkers also tend to have poor diets. Liver damage is now on the increase, particularly in children and young women. As diverse a diet as possible is the best insurance to maximise your range of microbial species and therefore your immune defences.</p> \n<p>Now when you wake up feeling unwell after a night out, you can blame your microbes as well as your pushy friends. But the microbes could also be part of the solution. If you are still keen on binge-drinking occasionally, at least start the evening with a slab of smelly cheese or a glass of high-fat natural yoghurt and let your microbes reduce some of the pain and suffering. Perhaps salt-and-microbe crisps could be the drinking partners of the future?</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> You can get your gut microbes tested and help research by signing up to the crowd funding project <a href=\"http://www.Britishgut.org/\" title=\"\">Britishgut.org</a></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434721422417/An-artists-impression-of--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An artist's impression of human intestinal microbes.

In the US one in three households has a capsule machine, which explains the ubiquity of K-Cups, these are the pods made by US market leader Keurig, which sold 9.8bn K-Cups in 2014. UK coffee drinkers have awoken to the charms of single-serve pods, too. Here, Nespresso is the market leader and sales grew by 50% last year.</p> \n<p>But the ubiquity of a single-use item that mixes organic waste (coffee), plastics and metals causes major eco-anxiety. Half a million viewers have watched <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRGiGbX9lIo\"><em>Kill the K-Cup</em></a>, a spoof disaster movie where spent capsules terrorise the planet. According to the haters, if last year’s spent coffee pods were taken out of landfills and lined up side by side, they’d wrap around the globe 10.5 times. Even the inventor of the pod, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/04/why-the-man-behind-keurigs-coffee-pods-wishes-hed-never-invented-them\">John Sylvan</a>, has denounced them. They’ve been called the cigarette butts of the coffee industry. Ouch.</p> \n<p>Keurig says it will make all K-Cups recyclable – but only by 2020. <a href=\"http://www.terracycle.co.uk/en-UK/\">Terracycle</a> (based in the US), which specialises in recycling the unrecyclable, is undeterred and has developed a system that strips the capsule into component parts, recycling the aluminium foil on top, composting the coffee grounds and recycling the filter. Meanwhile a Canadian coffee company has developed a pod that is 92% biodegradable. You will have spotted the flaw here; until it’s 100% biodegradable it’s about as useful as a chocolate teapot.</p> \n<p>The traditional advice would be to ditch the disposable and use a drip-brew system to make your coffee. However, if you can’t do without pods – and let’s face it, you’ve already bought two capsule machines – your hopes lie in taking the heat out of using them. It might sound obvious, but commit to recycling the pods – even when you’re travelling. Don’t expect your local authority collection to take them, though: current infrastructure favours single-stream materials (ie simple ones).</p> \n<p>Nespresso is at pains to point out that, as they’re made of aluminium, its pods are infinitely recyclable. To do so, book a collection via its Ecolaboration initative, print off a label and send it off, or drop spent pods into one of the “boutiques” where it sells pods in the first place.</p> \n<p>It would help if the coffee giants told us how many pods they recycle and set some goals, but they don’t. I’d urge them to spill the beans.</p> \n<h2>Green crush</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e91b7e38ddd136012d0a2e0e065611945242b7b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434559586978/2939b249-7048-4c5c-b0fb-00c4f30f937e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Revolutionary footwear: the Blackspot version 2.0\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Revolutionary footwear: the Blackspot version 2.0</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A return for the Blackspot UnSwoosher shoe, first featured here a decade ago. <br /> The original version was developed by Canadian ‘culture jammers’ Adbusters to prove it was possible to build a brand free of worker exploitation and celebrity endorsement. </p> \n<p>It featured a red dot on the toe cap to help take aim and ‘kick Phil Knight [Nike’s then CEO] up the ass’.

Not having to do it near naked. Few of us enjoy public undress and, despite the seasonal blather about diets and waxing and skin prep, it’s confidence not hard work that makes for memorable beach style. Sadly that doesn’t come from a bottle or a shop. Though nice beachwear does help.</p> \n<p>There are lots of useful online guides to choosing swimwear to suit your figure, but annoyingly nothing beats trying on. If you don’t go on piles of holidays then please don’t spend loads of money on something that will sit in a drawer for 50 weeks of the year. Primark and H&amp;M swimwear comes recommended. If you have bigger boobs then try Marks &amp; Spencer, or if you’ve got much bigger boobs, try Bravissimo. I really like BHS for cheap separates. It has every style from swim shorts to bandeau tops and most are currently under a tenner. I had a trusty black BHS bikini for so many years that in the end it rotted from the chlorine. I still miss it.</p> \n<p>That’s enough of the super sexy advice. I’m sure you’d rather hear about 2015 swimwear trends. There were quite a few one-pieces on the spring catwalks, including Chanel, Bottega Veneta and Peter Som. Acne Studios did a lovely cut-out style in a <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096542/\"><em>Baywatch</em></a> red. That’s a big colour this season, though personally I can’t wear a swimsuit in this colour without feeling a bit Special K. There’s also a strong sportswear feel in swimwear. Designers such as Zoe Karssen, Beth Richards and Cynthia Rowley have great wetsuits, mesh tops and cropped rash vests in imaginative prints and colours.</p> \n<p>Don’t worry though, there are lots of pretty little costumes in ethnic prints, crochet and soft hues, too. Try Prism London, which has just won funding from the British Fashion Council to expand the lovely range of beachwear and accessories created by founder Anna Laub. Prism specialises in elegant, minimal design in delicate colours. Roksanda Ilincic’s 2015 swimwear in liquorice allsorts shades is great, too.</p> \n<p>If you want to lust after the best in high-end beachwear, look at <a href=\"https://www.beachflamingo.com/\">Beach Flamingo</a>. This site carries beautiful products, though a lot of it costs more than my holidays.</p> \n<p>Of course, once you’ve found the perfect swimwear what you really want to do is cover it up. Kaftans and kimonos and shorts do this job well. The best high-street coverups come from Zara and Mango. I like the colours and patterns, and the prices are fair for something that’s going to get assaulted with chlorine, salt water, suntan lotion and ice cream for a fortnight (do buy machine washable). If you can be bothered, buy board shorts – they’re designed to get soaked and dry quickly, so they’re more comfortable on the sand than normal shorts.</p> \n<p>There you go, you’re ready as you’ll ever be. Have a brilliant time.</p> \n<p><em>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"https://instagram.com/aliceefisher/\">@aliceefisher

title=\"\"><strong>Sainsbury’s</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Although the region is best known for its whites made from sauvignon blanc and the stylistic chameleon chenin blanc, a number of red grapes are grown in the vineyards along the Loire valley. Recently I’ve enjoyed a plump beaujolais-like 2013 gamay from Robert S&eacute;rol in the southern C&ocirc;te Roannaise; a silky, light 2011 pinot noir from Vincent Pinard in Sancerre in the region’s centre, and a succulent 2011 take on the local grolleau from Clau de Nell in Anjou to the west. But the Loire’s red star is undoubtedly cabernet franc, with Domaine du Colombier’s Chinon a crisp, crunchy-fruited budget-friendly introduction.</p> \n<p><strong>Ch&acirc;teau de Hureau Tuffe Saumur-Champigny 2012 (&pound;14.35, </strong><a href=\"http://www.slurp.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Slurp</strong></a><strong>) </strong>What I like about Loire cabernet franc is its inherent lightness and freshness, both of which make it a versatile food-match. I’m thinking of salmon, as well as grilled meat. But with their distinctive mix of red fruit, graphite, floral fragrance, acidity and chalky tannic bite, and their generally low alcohol, the wines take well to being chilled and served with cold meats and cheese, too. Those closest to my personal ideal of cab franc are both from the Saumur-Champigny appellation: the raspberry-scented Domaine Filliatreau Classique 2013 and the perfectly modulated cherries of Ch&acirc;teau du Hureau’s 2012.</p> \n<p><strong>Charles Joguet Cuvee Terroir, Chinon France 2012 (&pound;13.80, </strong><a href=\"http://www.tanners-wines.co.uk/\" title=\"\"><strong>Tanners Wines</strong></a><strong>)</strong> Working at the northern limit of red-wine production, the Loire’s cabernet franc growers have in the past struggled to get sufficiently ripe grapes, leading to an aggressive tang of green pepper and lack of substance. But while the wines are never going to be big blockbusters, I found little evidence of those herbaceous qualities in those I tasted. And even in difficult vintages, such as 2012 and 2013, the better growers, such as Charles Joguet, are capable of making complex, elegant wines such as Clos de la Dioterie 2012 as well as vibrant, limpid reds like Cuv&eacute;e Terroir.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540948987/FRANCE-LOIRE-VALLEY-CHATE-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Reflected glory: Chateau Chambord, one of the many grand buildings dotted along the Loire.

While it is unlikely that any actual billionaires are in attendance (few of the moneyed elite would deign to take direction in such a public forum on matters as important as wine) avid gourmets and oenophiles patiently waited with budding anticipation.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68172eff3c739fa493d9a727955865e3d4560cdc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434812297547/b17357a8-06a6-4cf2-abc9-194e75704e4d-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"wine aspen\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Oldman with the expensive stuff.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Oldman</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>As the crowd filtered in, there was a buzz in the room. Each guest took a seat behind a series of six unmarked wines, two white and four red. </p> \n<p>After a few minutes, Oldman burst upon the stage, dressed in a rakish purple smoking jacket, with a wooden pipe hanging from his mouth. “If you went out and bought bottles of the wines that are in these glasses it would cost you at least $2,000,” he said. “I would venture to guess that these may be the most expensive wines ever poured at a consumer tasting.” With that, the crowd sat up a little taller and stared at the bounty, and beauty, in the glasses before them. </p> \n<p>Oldman began leading the assembled through a tasting of exceptional wines, beginning with the 2005 Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs.<strong> </strong>“This wine is made from the best grapes in only the very best vintages,” he explained<strong tabindex=\"-1\">.</strong>“One hundred percent chardonnay in a Blanc de Blancs, no pinot noir, just pure Chard.” The crowd sipped their bubbles and nodded in approval. “When is the best time to drink champagne?” he asked the audience. “Always!” the audience shouted in response.</p> \n<p>Next up was the 2005 Cos d’Estournel, a young bordeaux. “This is a Super Second,” he says as he briefly explains the Classification of 1855 pecking order. “What do you taste?” “Bong water!” screamed a man in the crowd. Oldman chuckled. “Only in Colorado,” he said in reference to the state’s recently relaxed cannabis regulations.</p> \n<p>The tasting continued through epic wines from Italy, Australia and California’s Napa Valley. As the vibe loosened further, thanks to the 7,900ft elevation, the early hour and the high-octane red wines, Oldman unsheathed a saber. “What’s the best time for champagne?” he bellowed again. “Always!” his audience replied, and a massive three-litre bottle of NV Champagne Barons de Rothschild Brut appeared onstage. </p> \n<p>Begin with bubbles and close with bubbles. That’s how the billionaires do it.</p> \n<p><strong>The wines (as stated by the presenter)</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1aa5b18671590ca580e82853c8dd5d24dda1102e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434812173319/028355b4-d3c6-4517-a398-a5ee699d4919-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"wine aspen\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The wines.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Oldman</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>2005 Taittinger Comtes de Champagne Blanc de Blancs, $180/bottle: </strong>A defining Blanc de Blancs from a house that was founded in 1743<strong> </strong></p> \n<p><strong>2005 Ch&acirc;teau Cos d’Estournel, $360: </strong>Any self-respecting billionaire requires bordeaux in the cellar.
