With the support of Hackney council, its pop-up office (a plastic pod on stilts at the bottom of the tree) has been installed in Hoxton’s leafy square. Blending into the natural scenery, the office is now open for bookings and is available to community groups free of charge at weekends. Users directly contribute to supporting parks in Hackney, as all income from the project is reinvested into more installations or into cultivating existing green spaces.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"73c10c5b889ed61147c32d683c5750128afc18de\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945354287/0013f8e4-32df-47f7-a244-43dd3c59ed2e-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Thinking inside the box ... workers try out the pop-up office.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thinking inside the box ... workers try out the newly-unveiled pop-up office in Hoxton Square, London</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Hobhouse/PA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The office was designed by the Australian architect <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Jeremijenko\">Natalie Jeremijenko</a>, in collaboration with the artists <a href=\"http://www.shustermoseley.com/\">Shuster + Mosley</a> and architects <a href=\"http://tateharmer.com/\">Tate Harmer</a>. Rory Harmer, of Tate Harmer, said the aim was to “create a new office concept, changing the way we work in the city”. It is one of a crop of alternative office-space projects in London, like <a href=\"http://www.boxpark.co.uk/\">BoxPark</a> in Shoreditch and <a href=\"https://www.wearepopup.com/pr/c89a272/\">ContainerVille</a> on the banks of the Regent’s Canal.</p> \n<p>Standing 4m tall, the main structure of the TREExOFFICE is made of compressed paper, while the outer walls are a combination of transparent plastic and translucent polycarbonate. The challenge was to create a space that is “robust, but blurs the boundary between the office and nature,” said Harmer. The greenery of the square filters through the panels, filling the office with a soothing light.</p> \n<p>For now, TREExOFFICE is still a prototype, but Groundwork London hopes that, if it proves popular, the project can be rolled out in more sites in and around Hackney.</p> \n<p>So, next time you see somebody slip into a garden square, laptop under arm, it might not just be for a lunchbreak. Project Park Hack wants us to reconsider our green spaces, and to do more with them. If all goes to plan, we might find translucent pods popping up in parks all around the country. <br /></p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945258120/98d27cc5-92b2-40f0-b72e-963724b259de-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jack Hobhouse/Jack Hobhouse","altText":"TREExOFFICE, Groundwork London's installation in the heart of Hackney","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jack Hobhouse/Jack Hobhouse"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945355246/0013f8e4-32df-47f7-a244-43dd3c59ed2e-1360x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1360,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"Thinking inside the box ... workers try out the newly-unveiled pop-up office in Hoxton Square, London Photograph: Jack Hobhouse/PA","credit":"Jack Hobhouse/PA","altText":"Thinking inside the box ... workers try out the pop-up office.","cleanCaption":"Thinking inside the box ... workers try out the newly-unveiled pop-up office in Hoxton Square, London","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jack Hobhouse/PA"}],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-11T07:31:10Z","lastModified":"2015-06-11T07:48:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":7,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Art and design","Culture","Architecture","Design"],"tags":[{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","webTitle":"Art and design"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"artanddesign/architecture","webTitle":"Architecture"},{"id":"artanddesign/design","webTitle":"Design"}],"section":{"id":"artanddesign"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"artanddesign"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/2015/jun/11/a-green-workspace-in-the-city-but-will-the-treehouse-office-catch-on","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kff","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/artanddesign/2015/jun/11/a-green-workspace-in-the-city-but-will-the-treehouse-office-catch-on","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jun/11/a-green-workspace-in-the-city-but-will-the-treehouse-office-catch-on"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945258120/98d27cc5-92b2-40f0-b72e-963724b259de-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Groundwork London’s installation in the heart of Hackney.

I think it’s good and I think it’s a bird that we can be proud of and hoist up on our shoulders now.”</p> \n<p>The robin is known for being openly aggressive towards birds it competes with for territory and food, and can kill them on occasion. Lindo attributed the bird’s popularity to a small island mentality.</p> \n<p>“Despite being a seemingly friendly bird, the robin is hugely territorial and very defensive of its territory and I presume that reflects us as an island nation that we will stand our ground,” he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Britain's National Bird Vote - results\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://charts.datawrapper.de/uMg5W/index.html\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"460\" height=\"300\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>Lindo said he hoped the government would now act to bestow official honours on the robin. Britain does not currently have a national bird, in contrast to Sweden’s blackbird, the US bald eagle, France’s rooster, Japan’s green pheasant and India’s peacock.</p> \n<p>Grahame Madge, RSPB spokesman, said it was the robin’s ubiquity that nudged it ahead. “Our birdlife is rich and varied, but perhaps it is no surprise that it is the robin which has stolen our hearts. It is the bird which summer and winter wherever you are in Britain is only a flutter away from our footsteps: a worthy winner.”</p> \n<p>The recently-appointed environment minister, Rory Stewart, said: “The robin is synonymous with the British countryside and I’m delighted that so many people voted in the poll to name it their favourite bird.”</p> \n<p>Lindo said the hen harrier, which came ninth out of the shortlist, was a notable inclusion. The bird has almost disappeared from England - just <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/2015/jan/13/-sp-mystery-of-the-missing-hen-harriers\">four pairs managed to nest successfully</a> last year. It has been targeted by grouse moor gamekeepers as a predator of grouse and a competitor of shooters.</p> \n<p>Lindo said the hen harrier was only vaguely known among the wider public despite a “massive movement” to try and protect it among conservationists. “Many people would have gotten to know about its plight” through the vote, he said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29c27e0460f9e9670379e59605e48686a583dc1c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433957226598/83df80c4-ab8e-4134-901b-8b2ca45c9a49-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Wild Barn hunting over Cotswolds grasslands\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wild barn owl hunting over Cotswolds grasslands</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jerome Murray/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Mark Avery, a conservationist and former RSPB director, said: “Three cheers for the robin – a lively bird and always the strong favourite to win this popular vote.

Less than half had seen the all of top 10 birds.

Are they trying to circumvent the baggage fees of budget airlines, or perhaps they’re traumatised by past experiences of baggage lost in transit, or maybe they’re just incapable of packing lightly?</p> \n<p>Whatever the reason, the airline industry this week announced they would be re-examining their requirements for carry-on luggage, with the dimensions for many airlines shrinking.</p> \n<p>The airlines’ trade body, the International Air Transport Association (IATA), <a href=\"http://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2015-06-09-02.aspx\">unveiled a new best-size guideline</a> for carry-on bags at 55cm (21.5in) tall by 35cm (13.5in) wide and 20cm (7.5in) deep. That’s 21% smaller than the size currently permitted by <a href=\"http://www.aa.com/i18n/travelInformation/baggage/carry-on-baggage.jsp\">American Airlines</a>, <a href=\"http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/traveling-with-us/baggage/during-your-trip/carry-on.html\">Delta Air Lines</a> and <a href=\"http://www.united.com/CMS/en-US/travel/Pages/BaggageCarry-On.aspx\">United Airlines</a> and smaller than the 56cm x 36cm x 23cm maximum size Qantas and Virgin allow on international flights.</p> \n<p>Eight major international airlines have already decided to adopt the new rules: Air China, Avianca, Azul, Cathay Pacific, China Southern, Emirates, Lufthansa and Qatar. There are more to follow, IATA promises.</p> \n<p>The guideline is designed to allow every passenger in a plane of 120 seats to put their luggage in the overhead compartments. Currently, <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4ad5be98dc724cdbbdd84fd16313df9e/airlines-want-smaller-carry-bags-free-overhead-bins\">20 passengers</a> per flight have to check their bags because overhead compartments are full.</p> \n<p>Australian low-cost carriers Jetstar and Tigerair enforce strict 7kg limits on carry-on.

Here are my top tips:</p> \n<h2><strong>1) Pack light</strong></h2> \n<p>It’s the simplest, yet most difficult commandment. Packing light is good in theory, but it is only human to plan for every contingency. </p> \n<p>Let’s say you’re packing for a holiday in Noosa. It’ll be sunny. You’ll only need a couple of pairs of short and some T-shirts, swimwear, undies, something neat for dinner and some toiletries. But what if it rains? Or if you wake up and actually feel like wearing the blue dress, not the red dress, but have left the blue dress at home? And what about the three volumes of Knausgaard that you’d been planning to read on the beach?</p> \n<p>The person who packs lightly is decisive. They don’t give a toss if the people of Noosa see them in the same outfit four days running. Or if they have nothing to read. All they need is a change of underwear and maybe an extra pair of shoes. But how to get to that cool, confident place where you are a light packer?</p> \n<p>British writer AA Gill reckons you have to be posh and rich to have the right mindset to pack light. </p> \n<p>As he put it in one of his travel columns: “One of the greatest mysteries of a traveller’s life is why is it that the amount of luggage carried is in inverse proportion to the net worth of the traveller. The richest people travel with the least … Tourist [economy class] is made of families and students shoving vast suitcases, like slaves building a Samsonite pyramid.”</p> \n<p>Why? “The poor travel with everything, because that’s all they own. The rich man gets what he needs at the other end.”</p> \n<p>So stop being poor and frightened, OK?</p> \n<h2><strong>2) Wear your carry-on</strong></h2> \n<p>They can’t stop you from wearing four jumpers, a skirt over jeans, seven scarfs and five T-shirts. You might have trouble walking, may not fit in your seat and the sweatiness from all the layers will make you a prime candidate for the “explosives test” – but hey you have a teeny-tiny backpack that fits neatly under your seat. You are International Air Transport Association approved.</p> \n<p>Another alternative is to wear a big jacket with multiple pockets and carry everything you need on you (ie scrunch up your clothes into balls and put them in your pocket).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b561bbb303f51d837c37a8ebd726892a797dbbf\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6b561bbb303f51d837c37a8ebd726892a797dbbf/0_0_632_619/500.jpg\" alt=\"Brigid Delaney wearing several scarves from her carry-on luggage before boarding a Tigerair flight at an airport in Melbourne, Australia, in 2014.

Notice the deliberate anonymity of costume: in a skirt, a leotard and stockings, I could pass on either side of the culture. Notice the mohair throw for trunk-line flights (ie no blankets) and for the motel room in which the air conditioning could not be turned off. Notice the bourbon for the same motel room,” wrote Didion.</p> \n<p>There are Tumblrs devoted to her list, and recently an American Elle reporter <a href=\"http://www.elle.com/fashion/personal-style/reviews/a27236/joan-didions-iconic-packing-list/\">packed like Didion</a> for a trip to LA. The result? “All in all, following Joan Didion’s packing list [below] was difficult – to say the least. The lack of options, while refreshing (and in line with my yearning for a uniform in high school), made me feel decidedly naked the entire weekend.” (Didion did not include any underwear on her list).</p> \n<p><strong>TO PACK AND WEAR:<br /></strong>2 skirts<br />2 jerseys or leotards<br />1 pullover sweater<br />2 pair shoes<br />Stockings<br />Bra<br />Nightgown, robe slippers<br />Cigarettes<br />Bourbon</p> \n<p><strong>BAG WITH: </strong><br />Shampoo<br />Toothbrush and paste<br />Basis soap<br />Razor<br />Deodorant<br />Aspirin<br />Prescriptions<br />Tampax<br />Face cream<br />Powder<br />Baby oil</p> \n<p><strong>TO CARRY:<br /></strong>Mohair throw<br />Typewriter<br />2 legal pads and pens<br />Files<br />House key</p> \n<p>Didion’s carry-on – apart from the typewriter – is light enough to fulfil the new requirements as laid down by the International Air Transport Association. </p> \n<p>Even better, these days you can substitute typewriter, two legal pads and pens and files for a light laptop. Not a writer? Even better. Replace her kit with a Kindle and your carry-on will be even lighter. You can use the extra room to pack underpants.</p> \n<p>If you’re a guy, ditch the leotards for T-shirts, pack two pairs of trousers, one shirt and a pair of shorts.</p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/6/1415275945134/6e54822a-4ea3-4571-9feb-63cdd74060ac-620x372.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Peter Dazeley/Getty Images","altText":"Man packing suitcase for vacation","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Peter Dazeley/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/6b561bbb303f51d837c37a8ebd726892a797dbbf/0_0_632_619/632.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":619,"width":632,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Brigid Delaney wearing several scarves from her carry-on luggage before boarding a Tigerair flight at an airport in Melbourne, Australia, in 2014.

Their latest study also found that nearly twice as many boys as girls said they do not enjoy reading at all, by 13% to 7%. </p> \n<p>“Too many boys still seem disinterested in reading, and far, far too many children simply never become readers at all. So we writers and illustrators and storytellers, and parents and teachers, and publishers and booksellers, must continue to play our part,” said the celebrated writer for young adults <a href=\"http://www.michaelmorpurgo.com/\">Michael Morpurgo</a>.</p> \n<p>So what do teachers think we need to do to ensure more boys enjoy literature? Here are some of the best ideas from our community:<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<h2>Find writers boys can relate to<br /></h2> \n<p>“I tore through books when I was a young child, but when I turned 12 or so there was a real fallow period. I felt too old for the books I had been reading and didn’t yet understand more mature texts. Things have developed a lot in the last 10 years with the rise of the young-adult fiction market, but I still think that pre-adolescent gap is where a lot of boys get lost to reading. For me, the catalyst to loving literature again was when I was introduced to a writer who I felt I had connections to – <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=iain+banks&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\">Iain Banks</a>. We were both from Fife, and the characters in his books spoke like me and thought like me. I think that was an important realisation, that writers aren’t all from far-off places, and books don’t all revolve around fantastical characters. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> \n<p>“So maybe that could be one way to re-engage boys with reading: finding local writers online, with ideas they will relate to, worries they will share, voices they can recognise and characters that they understand. Writers are always happy to come into schools to do visits and workshops.”</p> \n<p><em>Alan Gillespie teaches English at <a href=\"http://www.fernhillschool.co.uk/\">Fernhill school</a> in Glasgow.</em></p> \n<h2>Get dad reading<br /></h2> \n<p>“The best role models seem to be dads, sports coaches and athletes, men the boys aspire to be. If they experience these men reading and sharing their love of books (any kind of books) then reading is not seen as a female occupation. </p> \n<p>“Boys in general thrive on competition, action and bursts of intense activity, so the way they are expected to read needs to reflect this. Actors also make good role models – bringing one in to share his thoughts on a play or a screenplay would be cool too. </p> \n<p>“Dads and lads sessions work where physical activity is balanced with shared experiences of books and reading can also work. They involve campfire cooking and opportunites to chill out, away from technology, with a good book.”</p> \n<p><em>Cally Smart</em> <em>is an English and classics teacher. <a href=\"https://countrygate.wordpress.com/\">She blogs here</a>.</em></p> \n<h2>Be creative<br /></h2> \n<p>“A lot of the boys I teach are well below the reading level they should be for their age. I work at a primary behavioural emotional and social difficutlies (BESD) school in Hampshire.</p> \n<p>“One way to get boys engaged is by being a bit creative. In September 2014 I invited a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.petsastherapy.org/\">Pets As Therapy</a> dog into the classroom to hear the eight boys in my class read on a weekly basis. The children really enjoy reading to Perdy the labrador, who offers a non-judgmental ear, and all the boys have gone up at least two sub-levels in their reading. During the week, the children discuss which books they think Perdy will enjoy hearing. There is a real buzz around reading now. The only drawback is a slightly hairy classroom at the end of the session.”</p> \n<p><em>Anna Konig is a teacher at Wolverdene special school in Andover</em>.<br /></p> \n<h2>Inspire boys at home<br /></h2> \n<p>“Most of us dutifully do the school reading with our children when they are at primary school, hearts sinking at yet another deathless tale, but we must ask ourselves how often do our children see us reading when they are teenagers? Do we have shelves of books lining our walls? Do we take time to visit the library? If we want our children to value reading then we have to give books currency in the home.</p> \n<p>“It is often hard to find texts that both parents and teenagers can enjoy together. Reading a series of themed ‘classics’ such as all the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=james+bond&amp;order=relevance&amp;dir=desc\">James Bond</a> novels, coupled with a weekly pizza and film night is a great way to create a scheduled time in the week without distractions when everyone in the family reads.” </p> \n<p><em>David Anson is head of English at <a href=\"http://www.bedales.org.uk/\">Bedales school</a>.</em></p> \n<h2>Think about it like sport</h2> \n<p>“Explaining to boys that improving their reading is like sports training or playing an instrument can do the trick: they acknowledge the effort that needs to go into these kinds of activities; knowing the brain is like a muscle that can be trained can often help.</p> \n<p>“The advice I give to parents for reading at home is to find factual subjects boys might be into: sport, cars, music, computers, science; then buy a broadsheet newspaper on the day they read their specialist pull-outs. The interest in content will drive the reading which is often lengthy, with sophisticated levels of vocabulary and sentence structure.”</p> \n<p><em>Rachael Stevens is an English teacher and assistant headteacher at Christopher Whitehead Language college and sixth form.</em></p> \n<h2>Build trust<br /></h2> \n<p>“With reluctant boys it’s vital to establish a relationship with them if they are to trust you. It takes time but if you can get to know what makes them tick then there are ways to change their reading habits. A simple questionnaire at the beginning of the year can provide lots of information on hobbies and interests. Throughout the year, choose one of your reluctant readers every week and find a book or magazine or newspaper article about one of his interests. Read things that tap into their interests and, most importantly, be patient. Keep at it. You’ll hook them in the end.”</p> \n<p><em>Kenny Pieper is an English teacher in a large secondary school just outside Glasgow. </em></p> \n<h2>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

Not only were Dingbats a precursor to emoji, they were also good for riling Bryan Ferry </p>","byline":"Sam Wolfson","body":"<p>Last week, the typeface designer and calligrapher Hermann Zapf died at home in Germany, aged 96. If there was such a thing as rock star typographer, then Zapf would be it. His fonts are everywhere, from the <a href=\"http://www.esteelauder.co.uk/\">Est&eacute;e Lauder logo</a> to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/arts/design/hermann-zapf-96-dies-designer-whose-letters-are-found-everywhere.html\">war memorials</a>. He’s the man behind <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zapfino\">Zapfino</a>, the calligraphy font that changes as you type so the letters join up nicely (a lifeline for my barmitzvah thank-you cards).</p> \n<p>Yet Zapf’s most famous work contains no letters, but a series of stars, arrows, pointing fingers and fountain pen nibs. Zapf Dingbats was one of the first symbol-based fonts to be made available on laser printers, allowing everyone to use wacky bullet points in residents association minutes for ever more. Zapf Dingbats was an unusual symbol font: it had no thumbs up or thumbs down, but four different types of scissors and moe than 20 stars. It had no frowny face, but had a smiley face and a smiley face in inverse colours (perhaps a precursor to the current debate around the ethnicity of emoticons). Yet it marked the beginning of the use of symbols in word processing, changing for ever the way we speed-message our friends telling them we’re going to be late.</p> \n<p>I asked Thomas Phinney, a font and typography expert and vice president of <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/\">FontLab</a>, about Dingbats. He noted that Zapf’s influence is such that while he was writing to me he was served a bottle of water with a label written in Zapfino.</p> \n<p>“Symbol fonts such as Zapf Dingbats were especially handy in the early days of personal computing when integrating symbols and graphics into documents was harder,” he explains. “Because Zapf Dingbats was built into the first PostScript printers by Adobe, it became a standard. Among designers it achieved a legendary status when David Carson made <a href=\"http://mothersagun.tumblr.com/post/32756432374/david-carson-ray-gun-spread-1994-david-carson\">an entire article about Bryan Ferry unreadable</a> by setting it in Dingbats for Ray Gun magazine.”</p> \n<p>Apart from making dull music interviews fun, Zapf Dingbats would go on to heavily influence the Windows’ Wingdings which in turn created the building blocks for emoji, the globally used set of symbols popular the world over because of their easy integration in messaging and social media. Indeed some emojis – such as the peace sign and the smiley face – have come to take the same keyboard shortcuts as Zapf’s original versions.</p> \n<p>So here’s to Zapf, yes for his timeless contribution to typography and design, but also for his cool flower symbols you could use on birthday invitations.</p>","section":"Art & Design","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433950096497/cd2dc02e-47b6-4a0d-91c4-02cbebe6610a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Heinz-Juergen Gottert/DPA Germany","altText":"Hermann Zapf.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Heinz-Juergen Gottert/DPA Germany"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-10T17:57:36Z","lastModified":"2015-06-10T23:00:50Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":17,"contributors":[{"name":"Sam Wolfson","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/samwolfson"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Typography","Design","Art and design"],"tags":[{"id":"artanddesign/typography","webTitle":"Typography"},{"id":"artanddesign/design","webTitle":"Design"},{"id":"artanddesign/artanddesign","webTitle":"Art and design"}],"section":{"id":"artanddesign"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Sam Wolfson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/samwolfson"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"artanddesign"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/jun/10/why-we-love-hermann-zapf","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kky","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/jun/10/why-we-love-hermann-zapf","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/shortcuts/2015/jun/10/why-we-love-hermann-zapf"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433950096497/cd2dc02e-47b6-4a0d-91c4-02cbebe6610a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Hermann Zapf.
