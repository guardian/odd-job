Possibly in a bid to boost sales and ease back on the morbidity of it all, K&uuml;bler-Ross later gussied up her study to encompass any form of personal loss, such as the death of a loved one, the loss of a job, a relationship, a pet or indeed a promising 21-year-old striker who has scored 30 goals in his first full season in the Premier League.</p> \n<p><strong>Denial:</strong> “No, of course <strong>Harry Kane</strong> isn’t going to <strong>Manchester United</strong>. Ha-ha, the very notion! Ha!”</p> \n<p><strong>Anger:</strong> “Why us? Why would God let this happen?! WHY?!?!?!”</p> \n<p><strong>Bargaining:</strong> “Emmanuel Adebayor’s available; they could take him instead?”</p> \n<p><strong>Depression:</strong> “This sucks, another mid-table finish for us.”</p> \n<p><strong>Acceptance:</strong> “Ah, it’ll be fine. He’s probably just a one-season wonder anyway.”</p> \n<p>According to the Mail, Kane is top of Louis van Gaal’s summer shopping list and could become the latest high-profile Tottenham star to plod the well-trodden path between White Hart Lane and Old Trafford, following in the footsteps of Teddy Sheringham, Michael Carrick and Dimitar Berbatov. A whopping &pound;45m is the fee being mentioned in conjunction with a classic “swoop” for a player who inked a new five-and-a-half year deal in February.</p> \n<p>In old news we’ve all heard before, United will ramp up their efforts to lure <strong>Gareth Bale</strong> from a Real Madrid purgatory he has stoically shown no obvious desire to abandon, while they are also interested Wolfsburg’s <strong>Kevin de Bruyne</strong>. Van Gaal is also understood to be interested in picking up <strong>Danny Ings</strong> from Burnley for &pound;5m, at which point Brendan Rodgers may sniffily point out that Liverpool didn’t want him anyway. To accommodate all these high-profile arrivals at Old Trafford, Robin van Persie and &Aacute;ngel Di Mar&iacute;a will be frogmarched out the door marked “Do One”.</p> \n<p>Marseille’s Ghanaian striker <strong>Andr&eacute; Ayew</strong> has been a fixture in the Kings Cross crawlspace the Rumour Mill calls home for some months now, having announced his intention to leave the Ligue 1 side for pastures new and preferably Premier League this summer. The 25-year-old is this morning linked with <strong>Arsenal</strong>, <strong>Liverpool</strong> and – of course – <strong>Manchester United</strong>, who seem determined to stockpile prolific goal-getters in the manner of a club that has got wind of some kind of imminent striker apocalypse-o-gedden.</p> \n<p><strong>Arsenal</strong> also have their beady eye on <strong>Petr Cech</strong> but will attempt to prise <strong>Kasper Schmeichel</strong> from Leicester City should their efforts to sign the Chelsea goalkeeper be thwarted by a certain Portuguese wind-up merchant who may well scupper a prospective &pound;10m deal for no other reason than devilment masquerading as a reluctance to sell such a good player to a rival.</p> \n<p>Having all but secured their Premier League survival after an at times hairy season in the top flight, <strong>Leicester</strong> are reported to be interested in bidding &pound;8m for Mainz striker <strong>Shinji Okazaki</strong>, a Japan international who can also cut a dash in midfield and has previously attracted interest from Liverpool, Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur.</p> \n<p><strong>Chelsea’s</strong> attempts to sign Atl&eacute;tico Madrid pair <strong>Antoine Griezmann</strong> and <strong>Koke</strong> may well hit a snag now that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/14/atletico-madrid-chelsea-antoine-griezmann-koke\" title=\"\">our own Dominic Fifield has uncovered the Spanish side’s fiendish plan to raise the buyout clauses of both players to nearer &pound;100m in the new contracts they’ll be offered this summer</a>.</p> \n<p>And in management news, attempting to figure out what will happen at <strong>Leeds</strong> next is something of a fool’s errand but here goes: the contract of the manager, <strong>Neil Redfearn</strong>, expires in June but, despite the heroics he has performed in keeping this most dysfunctional of Championship clubs on an even keel, he has not yet been offered a new one.

Will Coldwell previews this year’s parties and talks to the UK promoter who helped kickstart the scene</p>","byline":"Will Coldwell","body":"<p>When Nick Colgan, Brummie music promoter and founder of the Garden Festival, moved to Croatia with his wife Charlotte to open a bar in Zadar, back in 2004, there was, as he puts it, “no one here”.</p> \n<p>The couple had fallen in love with the country’s rugged beauty after a family holiday a year earlier. “Tourism was just starting to pick up after the war,” he says. “Travelling here was difficult, too. The idea for a festival came about because we were just trying to find ways to get people over.”</p> \n<p>They found a venue in the tiny coastal resort of Petrčane, a few miles north of Zadar, and, with the help of family and friends in the music industry, threw the first Garden Festival for around 300 people.</p> \n<p>That was in 2006. A decade on and music festivals – for visitors at least – have become part of the cultural fabric of Croatia. Over the past five years, the number of festivals in the country has doubled: now there are 20 major events held across its islands and coastal resorts. And during the boom in 2011, when six new festivals launched, arrivals to Zadar, the main city and airport hub for the festival scene, increased by 51,000.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c15627b4957f7b8bf8a1484b4b8e27da8c2186f2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431618504806/9d381cda-1d3d-4884-8012-482b49cdad5e-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Fatboy Slim is set to perform at Croatia Rocks this summer\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fatboy Slim is set to perform at Croatia Rocks this summer.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Boczarski/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>While most events have a reputation for catering for specific musical niches – usually the dance and electronic scenes – 2015 will see the addition of its most mainstream festival yet, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/croatiarocksfestival\">Croatia Rocks</a>, on nearby Pag island. It’s an offshoot of the Ibiza Rocks event, and its lineup will include Fatboy Slim and <a href=\"http://www.thevaccines.com/\">The Vaccines</a>.</p> \n<p>This year is a milestone for the Garden team. They will be celebrating the 10th and final edition of the festival. Then their focus will be on managing their bar, also called the <a href=\"http://www.watchthegardengrow.eu/\">Garden</a>, in Zadar and a Garden venue down the coast in Tisno, which provides a site and a production team for many other festivals: it recently expanded to include 80 apartments and a campsite. This year, the team plans to open what will be the first craft brewery on the Dalmatian coast.</p> \n<p>Tisno’s mayor, Ivan Klarin, has seen a marked change in the town since Garden set up shop there. “Ten years ago it was rare to see that many young people enjoying Tisno and staying more than one or two days,” he says. “Many businesses have opened since the festivals established themselves. Locals are now more open to new ideas.” </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dced4353bf3fa1911b599e4e084970b983eb66a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431617850305/145378f4-9351-4052-9451-fe67935f0f64-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Splashdown in Pula … the Outlook Festival\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Splashdown in Pula … the Outlook Festival</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Medhurst</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This effect has been echoed elsewhere in Croatia. In Pula, the 19th-century Fort Punta Christo, is the striking venue for festivals including September bass party <a href=\"http://www.outlookfestival.com/lineup/\">Outlook</a> and underground electronic event <a href=\"http://www.dimensionsfestival.com/\">Dimensions</a> (at the end of August).</p> \n<p>The organiser of both, Noah Ball, says: “When we first turned up at the fort, there was really just the odd free party going on there – acid and grappa and 200 people. It now operates as a bar throughout the summer season, a handful of bars and restaurants have opened next door, and we’re closely tied with the mayor and tourist board. In Croatia, the holiday season is usually July and August. We’ve extended the season by a fortnight.”</p> \n<p>But the festivals have not always been universally welcomed. The transformation of Petrčane from a sleepy village to a party hub wasn’t to the taste of all the villagers – Colgan spent six months trying to get the priest back on side after the village was shaken to the core by Outlook festival’s debut dubstep event in 2008. Four years later, Colgan was forced to move the festival site to Tisno.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c104d62428374922a70dc5e74986e107abb1d10\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431618908918/f4bd9a71-8b6a-41db-802a-6999a1d24760-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Clear the decks … Theo Parish at the Dimensions Festival, Croatia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clear the decks … Theo Parish at the Dimensions Festival, Croatia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Medhurst</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>“Petrčane was the original site of a lot of the festivals and growth was tremendous while it had them there,” says Ball. “Hundreds of apartments were being put up at the time when the festival was told to move. If you go back there now, there are still hundreds of unfinished apartments.”</p> \n<p>Croatia remains a relatively low-key destination, as far as UK holidaymakers are concerned; it took some time to recover following the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s and just 400,000 Brits travel there each year, compared with the two million-plus who visit each of Italy and Greece, and the 12 million who visit Spain. But the festivals that have emerged – many of which are run by UK promoters who target their home followers – have turned it into a familiar party destination for young people.</p> \n<p>“Going to a festival in Croatia has almost become a university right of passage,” says Ball. “A few years ago, we had a series of dreadful summers in the UK and some people were looking beyond Ibiza for a dance-music experience. The lineups at European festivals elsewhere are just as good, and the tickets are often cheaper.”</p> \n<p>For Colgan, who – by providing a site, local connections and support for promoters – has been instrumental in the growth of the scene, the explosion has still come as a surprise.</p> \n<p>“Never in a million years could I have predicted how it would pan out,” he says. “After that first festival, I remember turning to my partner, Eddie, and saying that was it. That was never gonna happen again … But it just kept on rolling.”</p> \n<h2><strong>THIS SUMMER’S EVENTS…</strong><br /><strong>The Garden Festival</strong><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4666d0b457628cda75e24d0a3b8df3ffa674299b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431617514106/6122c402-5005-45a4-9966-24d41c0f9d2d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Garden Festival\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Khris Cowley</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The final blowout for the Garden Festival will undoubtedly be a magical affair.

Its horizontal stripes were black and blue. Or were they white and gold? <br /></p> \n<p>The debate prompted 10 million tweets in the first week. But as Twitter users argued over the colours of the dress, scientists turned to the bigger question: why did people see the same image so differently?<br /></p> \n<p>Now, researchers in the US have come up with an answer, of sorts. They believe that as we live our lives, our brains devise strategies for working out the true colours of objects in different situations. But because we have different experiences, our brain models differ too.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/head-quarters/2015/feb/27/the-dress-blue-black-white-gold-vision-psychology-colour-constancy\">Is The Dress blue and black or white and gold? The answer lies in vision psychology | Marie Rogers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bevil Conway, a researcher at Wellesley College and MIT, asked 1400 people, 300 of whom had never seen the picture before, to describe the dress. Overall, 57% said it had blue and black stripes, 30% saw white and gold stripes, and another 10% saw blue and brown. About 10% could switch between either colour combination.<br /></p> \n<p>But among the responses, Conway saw another pattern. Women and older people were more likely to see the dress as white and gold. The same group are more likely to be larks, being awakein sunlight hours, rather than owls, who were awake more at night time.<br /></p> \n<p>He speculates that people who stay up later have more experience of artificial lighting which has more reddish light in it. Their brains may then be accustomed to correcting from reddish illumination. Take these colours out of the dress image, and it appears blue and black.<br /></p> \n<p>Conversely, people who are awake in daylight hours are exposed to more natural light, which contains more blueish light than artificial light. If the brain assumed the dress was illuminated by more natural sunlight, and corrected for blueish illumination, the colours appear more white and gold.<br /></p> \n<p>“Maybe people have an internal model of these two colour biases and are wired up to unconsciously clean any images of that colour information,” Conway said.<br /></p> \n<p>The researchers next tried to recreate the original illumination of the image and concluded that it was bathed in natural sunlight from a window on the right of the image, but also with artificial light in the shop where the photograph was taken. <br /></p> \n<p>“The result is that you end up with a completely ambiguous light source that by chance or not is such that your visual system doesn’t know what the hell to make of it,” said Conway. With too little information to resolve the ambiguity, the brain falls back on prior experience to interpret the colours at hand. Or so the idea goes.<br /></p> \n<p>Conway emphasises that far more work is needed before scientists can be sure what is happening. “We only have circumstantial evidence. What makes the image powerful, is it provides a tool to probe these internal models,” he said. The study appears in the journal <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2015.04.053\">Current Biology</a>.<br /></p> \n<p>The researchers went on to show how more obvious clues about the lighting of the dress could make almost everyone agree on the colours of the stripes. Conway’s colleague, Rosa Lafer-Sousa, took a digital copy of the dress and superimposed it on a model standing against different backgrounds. When the scene had blue lighting, people overwhelmingly saw the dress as white and gold. In artificial lighting, the dress appeared black and blue to most people.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dquyFf3zCoM\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dquyFf3zCoM?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Giving obvious clues about lighting allows most people to agree on the colour of the stripes. Video: \n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdwlny3yhaRVq4vBdvTA_eg\">Rosa Lafer-Sousa</a>\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>David Brainard, director of the Vision Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said: “The image really pries open big differences in individual perception and we might learn something fundamental about colour vision if we knew what it was.<br /></p> \n<p>“It’s quite plausible that as we walk around the world, the brain is correcting for illumination so as to stabilise the colours of objects, more or less.”<br /></p> \n<p>But Brainard is more cautious about going any further than that. That larks and owls might see colours differently because of their time spent in daylight or under artificial lighting was “far out in speculation land,” he said. “We have no idea. I wouldn’t bet on it being true.”<br /></p> \n<p>He puts forward another possibility. As people age, the density of the lenses in their eyes increases. That filters certain wavelengths from the light that falls on the retina, and so the visual information that brain has to work with. But whether that pays a role in the dress colours is speculation on his part, Brainard said.<br /></p> \n<p>“What I think is most important is that this internet craze wasn’t an artefact of people looking at a different displays. These are real individual differences,” he added. <br /></p>","section":"Science","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431621416433/d44f6f66-e816-4add-9d1b-852c80adbc49-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Cecilia Bleasdale/PA","altText":"The Dress: blue and black or gold and white?","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Cecilia Bleasdale/PA"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-14T17:00:34Z","lastModified":"2015-05-14T23:24:51Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":208,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Sample","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733739319/IanSample.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iansample"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Science","Neuroscience","Social media","Tumblr","Twitter","Internet"],"tags":[{"id":"science/science","webTitle":"Science"},{"id":"science/neuroscience","webTitle":"Neuroscience"},{"id":"media/social-media","webTitle":"Social media"},{"id":"technology/tumblr","webTitle":"Tumblr"},{"id":"technology/twitter","webTitle":"Twitter"},{"id":"technology/internet","webTitle":"Internet"}],"section":{"id":"science"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian Sample","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/iansample"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"science"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/science/2015/may/14/thedress-have-researchers-solved-the-mystery-of-its-colour","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49vxc","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/science/2015/may/14/thedress-have-researchers-solved-the-mystery-of-its-colour","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/may/14/thedress-have-researchers-solved-the-mystery-of-its-colour"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/14/1431621355016/768d05c9-6dc5-4eb2-93bb-62e41f753d4b-1345x2040.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2040,"width":1345,"orientation":"portrait","caption":"The Dress: blue and black or gold and white?

Not so much a note clearly sung, as a groany rattle, a scrape, more a throaty spluttering cement mixer filled with sand and pebbles. I was 13, my voice had broken for a few months, but my larynx was still liable to leap uncontrollably into a momentary Mickey Mouse. My mate Michael, standing next to me, almost made me burst out laughing, but the apparent gravitas of the moment and the glare from a older colleague across from us stemmed the smirking. And so the note was held, for a few faulty seconds. It was my debut in the local church choir’s bass section – my first audible bottom E in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6JfInyQI9Q\">Edward Bairstow’s I Sat Down Under His Shadow</a> ... “with great delight”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"58bc4df76c63c7d9c87333b80caffa5e98d0d9dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431433143926/2396db9b-f9db-41e0-b574-2544c87061af-346x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Nina Simone in 1977.

A character of depth, not only in voice but in all kinds of ways. Tangle with her at your peril</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Media Press/Rex</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Deep voices aren’t so much in demand in the world of popular song, where it is more often high voices that hog the limelight. My attention also went that way in my mid-teens – away from my church scene where rock’n’roll and girls were certainly not to be found and you needed to join a band for that. But deep-voiced artists, whether male or female, can put in an even more powerful performance perhaps because of their relative rarity in pop, soul and rock. And some of the biggest sex symbols in music history have had deep ones. </p> \n<p>But while this week’s song nominations need not be limited to those genres, nor do they need to be confined to singers with the very lowest notes. Singers with low voices often stand out and it is not so much the pitch, but the context in which they sing such notes that can qualify them in your nominations. Nina Simone, for example, inspiration to Nick Cave and many others, does not sing as low as a male bass, but her contralto range and delivery would more than qualify her for this week’s contenders.</p> \n<p>But how low can we go? The offical Guinness Record holder for lowest voice and indeed astonishing range of 10 octaves is US singer and composer <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaPtiFO-NLc\">Tim Storms</a> – most people struggle to reach a full two octaves. For my money his range doesn’t necessarily create great music, but who does? Here are a few suggestions of singers, but not songs, for your consideration:</p> \n<p>One of the first superstar basses of the 20th century was Paul Robeson. Handsome, smart, built like bull, and like many great singers born into the church – his father was a preacher – he was heavily involved in the civil rights movement, was a political activist against fascism in the Spanish civil war, and was blacklisted in the McCarthy era. Yet alongside his singing, his acting roles made him famous, in particular Show Boat and Othello. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyJtGNk9iEU\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yyJtGNk9iEU?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Paul Robeson rollin’ along with the Mississippi in Show Boat. Behind the glorious music is message of misery and slavery\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Staying in a gospel theme, but in a different demographic, you might also check out Florida-born singer JD Sumner, who before Storms, held a world record for sing the lowest note (a gut-gurgling G almost two octaves below my basic E) and as well performing with the Stamps Quartet, also did backing for Elvis Presley. Perhaps most mesmerising of all is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_wW4OJwjY\">his moving hairline</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mu_wW4OJwjY\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mu_wW4OJwjY?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  JD Sumner does Wayfaring Stranger – stranger even than his moving hair?\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The classical genre is full of strong basses, but one of the greatest must surely be Russian <em>basso profundo</em> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oMjRhlaMaI\">Vladimir Miller</a>. His voice is richer than any oil fields and lower than the temperatures in Siberia, where he was born. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oMjRhlaMaI\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0oMjRhlaMaI?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Vladimir Miller – rich tones of eastern promise\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Looking for something more unusual? Female vocalists certainly qualify if they sing relatively low to their peers, or the music that accompanies them, and then there’s a whole other league in the form of Iceland’s Hallbj&ouml;rg Bjarnad&oacute;ttir Nielsen, who in this clip from 1960, shows not only what the female voice can be capable of, but also that cheesy TV programme formats are nothing new at all.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kJWMGdJwkk\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5kJWMGdJwkk?wmode=opaque&amp;feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Iceland’s Hallbj&ouml;rg Bjarnad&oacute;ttir Nielsen unleashes a surprise on I’ve Got a Secret\n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The acting world is full of rich, deep voices, ranging from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ixt_t46k4Q\">Orson Welles (listen to him making a frozen peas commercial)</a> to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=165_xTQiALs\">Ving Raimes</a>, smoothies such as George Clooney and Morgan Freeman, to the horror-hype voice of king of movie promos <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7QPMvj_xejg\">Don LaFontaine</a>. Then there’s voice of Darth Vader himself <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvzZ-HBdKm8\">James Earl Jones</a> (though I still admire his evil snake king in Conan the Barbarian more). What would they sound like if they sang? Are there any songs in which a deep voice is significantly spoken? Are there some poets or notably deep-voiced hip-hop artists to nominate? Chuck D? Michael Franti? There are plenty.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e626a89f670d39df4e51f6e4abe1c532bb1d4a28\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/12/1431433497976/12b2e920-51b3-48da-ac2b-19fbe4d9c1d1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Elephants win\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You want deep voices?
