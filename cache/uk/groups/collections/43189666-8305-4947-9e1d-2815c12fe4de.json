Rallies took place in Athens and elsewhere in support of a no vote.</p> \n<p>But European leaders lined up to call the referendum a vote on whether Greece would stay in the euro or leave, piling more pressure on Tsipras and his colleagues.</p> \n<p>Our full report is here:</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/29/greek-crisis-referendum-eurozone-vote-germany-france-italy\">Europe's big guns warn Greek voters that a no vote means euro exit</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Meanwhile overnight, EC president Jean-Claude Juncker - after earlier calling for a yes vote - apparently made a last-minute offer to Athens to reach an agreement before the bailout deadline ends.</p> \n<p>Under the deal, Tsipras would have to campaign for a yes vote, which is hardly likely to happen. Reuters has some details of what would have been in it for the Greeks:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"2\">The offer published on Sunday incorporated a proposal from Greece that would set value-added tax rates on hotels at 13 percent, rather than at 23 percent as originally planned in the lenders’ proposals. It was not immediately clear whether there would be any additional changes.</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"3\">If the offer were accepted, the euro zone finance ministers could adopt a statement saying that a 2012 pledge to consider stretching out loan maturities, lowering interest rates and extending an interest payment moratorium on euro zone loans to Greece would be implemented in October.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"3\">In a sign that battle lines continue to be drawn EU leaders have turned Sunday’s proposed referendum into an in/out vote on Greece’s position in the euro<strong>,</strong> when it is clearly about the creditors proposal, but given that polls appear to suggest a majority of the Greek population would prefer to stay in the euro, it suits the narrative of the EU to peddle that particular line. </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"4\"> In fact EU Commission President Juncker strayed a little too far into the realms of bad taste yesterday, urging the Greek population not to commit suicide by voting No, which in a country that has seen suicides soar as a result of EU policies, was crassly insensitive, and could well turn out to be a massive own goal, if the vote is indecisive. Maybe that explains last night’s late move to make a fresh attempt at trying to reach a deal by the EU Commission President, but in any event the deal was rebuffed by the Greek PM, with the only concession appearing to be on VAT for hotels being held down at 13%, instead of raised to 23%.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Worries about the chaos in Greece hit stock markets yesterday, with the FTSE 100 down nearly 2% and French and German markets down 3%.<br /></p> \n<p>Asian markets <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/30/asian-markets-creep-up-as-the-euro-sags-in-deepening-greek-crisis\">edged up overnight </a>but European markets are expected to open lower once more.

But then we went one step further and said we should put it to the Greek people as a whole, let democracy work, which would have meant extending the programme by a week or so,” he said of Greece’s request to prolong its financial lifeline. “I really can’t see why that couldn’t happen. Extending [the programme] by a few days would not have been the end of the world.” </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"6\">Political commentators this morning said it was clear that Tsipras’ leftist-led government was still holding out for a better deal. “He is still playing some kind of poker, waiting for something better,” said Christos Memis, a veteran political analyst now in charge of the respected news portal, Protagon.gr. “That is very unlikely to happen now before the poll [on Sunday]. What has become clear is that lenders don’t trust Tsipras, they want him out and he is right when he says the differences are ideological, it is no longer just about him.” </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"7\">Tsipras may be trapped in his referendum gambit but creditors had also made several mistakes, Memis said. </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"8\"> “Tactically speaking they were totally wrong not to accept the 47-page list of proposals the government made last week. Had they accepted it and Tsipras tried to implement it, six months later his government would have collapsed, he would have gone.” </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"9\">Greeks are waiting with baited breath for the release of several opinion polls that will reflect just where the country stands, psephologically, on the “no,” “yes” vote. “Things will become much clearer and move a lot faster when the polls come out later today and tomorrow,” said Memis. </p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-559259e3e4b01275a173c21f","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:57:24Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:57:32Z","body":"<p>And could those talks in fact actually take place after all?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EKourtali/statuses/615805002406166528\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Greek government is thinking of returning to the negotiating table by tonight, Greek media report</p>— Eleftheria Kourtali (@EKourtali) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EKourtali/status/615805002406166528\">June 30, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-5592582de4b01275a173c213","title":"EU attempting to open new talks with Greece","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:53:11Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-30T08:58:04Z","body":"<p>Attempts are being made to get Athens back to the negotiating table, according to Austrian finance minister Hans Joerg Schelling.</p> \n<p>But he said he was not very optimistic about the possibility of holding further talks with Greece. </p> \n<p>The comments came after EC president Jean-Claude Juncker made a last-minute offer to Athens to reach an agreement before the bailout deadline ends later today.</p> \n<p>“Attempts are taking place to hold further talks.

Many have been saying that if Greece does not pay the €1.6bn due to the International Monetary Fund by tonight’s deadline that does not count.</strong> Gary Jenkins, chief credit strategist at LNG Capital, is not so sure:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"1\">Greece is due to pay the IMF today. It appears that they will not make the payment. There has been lots of talk that this is not really a default. Indeed the rating agencies have stated that they would not consider a non-payment as a default. All I can say on this matter is that if you do not pay the absolute last lender of resort I think that’s a default.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>We’ll see how the markets take it when it happens (as seems inevitable). On the referendum, Jenkins says:</p> \n<blockquote> \n <p data-dropid=\"2\">My take on it is that if the Greek people vote ‘No’ to the proposals that Mr Tsipras may feel vindicated and insist upon a new round of negotiation. However the probable damage done to the economy by recent events will make this a largely Pyrrhic victory. It is possible that the Institutions will restart negotiations but it is equally likely that they would indeed regard such a result as a step towards exit from the Eurozone. I’m leaning towards more negotiations but with little additional support from the ECB so more damage to the economy.</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"3\"> If the Greek people vote ‘Yes’ then it is difficult to see how Mr Tsipras can remain as Prime Minister. Under this scenario a new government is likely to be formed that will accept the Institutions terms which I guess may be eased somewhat to reflect the new economic conditions and to try and build a new relationship between the parties.</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"4\"> So whilst the impact upon the market on Day 1 has been less than feared that is not to say that we will not see further weakness over the coming days. The market may have been taking comfort from all of the opinion polls that have taken place in Greece over the last few years showing that the Greek people wanted to stay in the Eurozone at pretty much any cost. However all of these polls were taken before the call for a referendum. Certainly I would expect a ‘No’ vote to be met with significant volatility in peripheral government bonds amid the classic flight to quality.</p> \n <p data-dropid=\"5\"> This is clearly now a fast moving situation and it is still by unclear as to how it will play out. As an old credit analyst my instinct therefore is to be cautious and wait to see what the weekend brings. Next Monday could be a much worse day for peripheral debt than yesterday was if the ‘No’ vote wins.</p> \n</blockquote>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55924354e4b0e31832956e17","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:21:24Z","body":"<p>Not that we thought they had but:</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/statuses/615781204856418304\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"> \n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Russia Reiterates Greece Hasn't Applied For Financial Aid: RIA</p>— Steve Collins (@TradeDesk_Steve) \n  <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TradeDesk_Steve/status/615781204856418304\">June 30, 2015</a> \n </blockquote> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55923fb4e4b0e31832956e0e","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:08:06Z","body":"<p>European markets edge lower in early trading</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23e1b4f893969f80d2726882496bd78619b91426\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435648058988/00cc1bb6-c524-4433-9e85-7902aa44bc2e-460x51.png\" alt=\"Markets dip in early trading.\" width=\"460\" height=\"51\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Markets dip in early trading.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-55923e97e4b0e31832956e0c","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-30T07:01:49Z","body":"<p>If Greece does default on its payment to the IMF it will be following an historical precedent.

You might have thought that point would have arrived on Sunday when it was announced that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/athens-atm-queues-lengthen-week-long-bank-closures\" title=\"\">banks would not be opening the next morning</a>.

It felt like listening to a voicemail message from a dead relative.</p> \n<p>This has been coming since the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2014/may/26/syriza-european-elections-greece\" title=\"\">European elections of 2014</a>. That was the moment when Greece’s conservative-led coalition – which had overseen an unpopular programme of financial aid conditional on spending cuts and reforms dictated by foreign lenders – was routed by populists of the hard left. The panicked handling of this development by Greece’s tainted political establishment and the intransigence of the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and European Central Bank, ensured that this momentum built.</p> \n<p>It was at this point that I returned to Athens after a 10-year absence. I lived in and reported on Greece for several years prior to 2004 and spent the ensuing decade in the newsrooms of London and as a foreign correspondent in Africa and elsewhere. Taking a break from journalism, I joined a software startup that is trying to build a Greek success story in the midst of the economic wreckage. For all its rewards, this decision has given me an unwanted vantage point to observe the unravelling of an extraordinary country.</p> \n<p>The collapse of Greece’s corrupt political centre was marked earlier this year by the election of the left coalition, Syriza. Its success was built on the lie that it could deliver the same financial aid with fewer of the austere strings than its predecessors. Now that this lie has run it course, Syriza has abdicated responsibility for its own failure.</p> \n<p>The result will be a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/29/joseph-stiglitz-how-i-would-vote-in-the-greek-referendum\" title=\"\">referendum this Sunday</a> with a crudely designed ballot in which the “no” box is given top billing and the question is framed in almost meaningless bureaucratic language. <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/world/alexis-tsipras\" title=\"\">Greece’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras</a>, who has gone into full obfuscation mode, will push for a “no” vote without any discussion of what that would mean. In other words, the Greek government will now campaign to have its own failure at the negotiating table endorsed by the very people it will hurt the most. And there is every chance this deception will succeed.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Bankruptcy, rupture and isolation will be welcomed with unfathomably foolish pride</p> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>It has been clear that the choice awaiting Greece was a future that looked like Portugal, a degraded economy of the European south; or Serbia, a proud nation led into the international wilderness by populists’ lies and fantasies of Russian rescue. Neither are good choices, but one is incalculably worse than the other.</p> \n<p>Now is the time when the lazy lie of Greek exceptionalism, dripped like poison for decades into the country’s dysfunctional, nationalistic education system, will find its full expression. Bankruptcy, rupture and isolation will be welcomed with unfathomably foolish pride. The giddy talk of a second “oxi day” (the anniversary of Greece’s second world war refusal to surrender to fascist Italy) will not be calmed. For all its lunacy a “no” vote looms.</p> \n<p>Outsiders will look on in bewilderment. Unlike money, there is plenty of blame to go around. The scramble to avoid responsibility will be excruciating, as the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/29/alexis-tsipras-must-be-stopped-the-underlying-message-of-europes-leaders\" title=\"\">press conference on Monday by European Commission head Jean-Claude Juncker</a> demonstrated. But this shambles will be of comparatively little consequence for those outside Greece.</p> \n<p>The return of the drachma will bring misery with it. Devaluation, runaway inflation, shortages of food and medicine will be managed by an administration and populace whose default response is to blame enemies abroad.</p> \n<p>Many critics of austerity who cheer on Tsipras wear their ignorance of Greek specifics like a badge of honour, with the US economist <a href=\"http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/?_r=0\" title=\"\">Paul Krugman</a> a particularly egregious example. Others, like the British broadcaster <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/29/greece-chaos-syriza-gamble-banks-closed-referendum\" title=\"\">Paul Mason</a>, who is steeped in the lore and mores of the Greek left, are willing to see the country used as the vanguard of a doomed challenge to capitalism. Perhaps when the coffee runs out – for all its sunshine Greece lacks the altitude to grow it – a reflection point will be reached. By now I doubt even that.

I have many times read articles that mention how happy we seem spending time outside in the Spring etc. So, how should we react, in your opinion? Wander around desperately? Most of us have realised that there is no hope, at least for the generations that are now 20-30. So, we just have to live with it and try to be happy with what we have. It doesn’t mean that we are insensitive to the situation. Maybe we are desperate to survive; not only physically but also emotionally. <br />In the end, as far as the EU is concerned, I am completely disappointed by the way they try to force the Greek government to totally surrender. I am sure there will be no EU in a few years. After all this is not a “Union” at all, only a couple of strong capitalistic countries that are making profit from the crisis, leading poorer and weaker countries to total destruction. This is the third effort of Germany to conquer Europe, not with war this time but with economic war. Greece is the first country to face the consequences of this situation, but I am sure many more countries will follow.</p> \n  <p data-dropid=\"4\">Παναγιώτης PanagiotisOccupationΆνεργος Unemployed, saysnoto eurozone Ξεκίνησα με πολλές προοπτικές αλλά αυτές έκλειναν η μία μετά την άλλη.

Athens right now is slick with perspiration; every public space is charged with hormonal tension and political disagreement – even the bakery where you buy your morning bread. The politics are brutal. Last week, stick-wielding anarchist youths attacked the HQ of the Antarsya – a far-left anti-capitalist party – because the latter had tried to make them pay to go into a music festival when the anarchists thought it should be free.</p> \n<p>I’ve seen, in the bohemian Exarchia district, a troupe of black-clad 15-year-olds distrupt a whole street full of similarly bohemian cafe-goers on a Saturday night, using petrol bombs and flaming rubbish bins, simply because “creating mayhem” is their doctrine.</p> \n<p>Athens has become, in short, the stage for flamboyant acts of self-dramatisation: sporadic riots, public kissing, street theatre and ill-advised scooter techniques. It is, to use a phrase Huxley once used about Shanghai, “life with the lid off”, and for the same reasons: “so much life, so carefully canalised, so rapidly and strongly flowing”.</p> \n<p>Antonis Vradis, a geographer at Durham University who has studied the impact of repeated waves of unrest here since 2008, describes how the youth networks have been preparing for this week’s “rupture” with the ECB: “They are creating structures you can’t default on. Self-organised clinics, the social centres you see all around you. Structures that will help them survive.”</p> \n<p>I meet Vradis in Floral cafe on the corner of Exarchia Square. He points out that the building – shabby as it is now – is a Bauhaus masterpiece. More importantly, during the 1944 uprising against the British, “the communists were snipers on the roof”.</p> \n<p>The young here live always with a portion of their brain operating in the past. They don’t need wall plaques. When they move through Exarchia, or Syntagma, or up the side of parliament towards the mansion prime minister Alexis Tsipras now occupies, they can “see” where the resistance fighters died; where the students of 1974 stopped a tank.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b1a1ad37ccdfb13cfa092ea590eada9c0eec441\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435598561522/82925ccc-85da-443b-a625-feb3c9df548a-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alexis Tsipras in parliament\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexis Tsipras in parliament.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NurPhoto/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It was the young people radicalised amid this landscape who pitched a tent camp outside parliament in 2011. They organised a movement most foreign journalists didn’t see: local assemblies in small squares across the city and its suburbs, where young mums, migrants and outraged pensioners could have their say. The communists denounced them; the socialists sent riot police to disperse them; Tsipras is said to have looked out of the window of his office and delared: those are the people who will put us into power.</p> \n<p>But Syriza is different. Syriza is a coalition whose colours are red for socialism, green for ecology and purple for feminism. But it is primarily red. It was born out of Eurocommunism – when the communist parties of the west declared loyalty to parliamentary democracy instead of Moscow. Its most influential activists are aged 50 and above: people who have read all three volumes of Karl Marx’s Capital, plus the Grundrisse, Theories of Surplus Value and Friedrich Engels’ Anti-D&uuml;hring. A lot of them are MPs now, or special advisers: you’ll find them in greying huddles in their old haunts – the radical bars and cafes of Exarchia and Plaka.</p> \n<p>How this generation of Greek leftwingers broke out of isolation is of more than academic interest. They have managed – for the first time in modern history – to form a government that defied the global finance system, and to do so with flair.</p> \n<p>Their strength was that they understood the significance of the youth revolts of 2008 and 2011. Some pitched their own tents in Syntagma Square and were tear-gassed out of it. But in the process, the party built something more official and resilient.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"71e76233ad1e4100b35ad8b6dccbb28c798b60d5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435599348009/0df98774-1e20-4bfd-92c6-3dc504638d7c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Syriza supporters in 2014\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syriza supporters in 2014.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Their weakness, it turns out, starts with Nicos Poulantzas. Poulantzas was a Greek intellectual of the new left who famously clashed with Ed Miliband’s father, Ralph, in 1969 over the nature of the capitalist state. Miliband said the state was “capitalist” because personally controlled by<strong> </strong>the business elite. Poulantzas said the state was structurally capitalist – independent of the will of individuals.</p> \n<p>Poulantzas evolved a dual strategy for the Greek left in the 1970s: first, to encircle the state with social movements, which were not to be controlled by any party but allowed to become expressions of popular democracy. And at the same time, to enter the state, democratise it and use it to pursue social justice. Poulantzas killed himself in 1979, but his ideas guided the precursor organisation to Syriza. Not many people remember now, but the party’s predecessor, Synaspismos, joined a short-lived coalition government with the conservatives in 1988, and a national government thereafter.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"b2bee148a02ec1caf3ce8ec10adeeefd3e459e96\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435598683877/705fb1c1-b3b1-40bf-ab13-ad43aac5a495-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nikos Poulantzas.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nikos Poulantzas.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophie Bassouls/Sygma/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the runup to its election victory, Syriza got a chance to execute the Poulantzas strategy of the march through the state: it won the Euro elections and the vital prefecture of Attica, where its candidate was protest veteran Rena Dourou. Then it won state power – but that has turned out differently.</p> \n<p>When Tsipras took over the Maximos Mansion, the PM’s residence, the outgoing government removed all computers and all soap. There is soap now, and computers, though no Wi-Fi for security reasons. Tsipras rules from one side of a marble hall; the other side is the cabinet room. In the basement are secure meeting rooms and offices. At the weekend, you will often find somebody’s children crayoning on the floor. The ceremonial guards, in their white tunics, sip <em>freddo-cappuccino</em> on a narrow terrace, alongside press photographers and armed bodyguards.</p> \n<p>In power, Syriza has discovered the unguessed secret of the Greek state. Without oligarchs, it is inefficient. So thoroughly did the old parties use patronage to run the operation that they barely needed a civil service, or the shock absorbers provided by independent regulators and quangos normal in a state such as Britain. I have seen ministers confronted with ridiculously detailed operational decisions, such as the appointment of a new boss for the state TV channel, which in Britain would be delegated to a regulator, but in Greece fell to minister of state Nikos Pappas. Finance minister Yanis Varoufakis routinely handles his own press: though he has press officers drawn from Syriza, the actual press operation of the Greek state is barely engaged.</p> \n<p>Yannis Dragasakis, Greece’s deputy prime minister, was in many ways the embodiment of Syriza’s long-term dreams. His team of advisers included those most attuned to the “horizontalist” agenda emerging out of the networked social movements; people whose main desire was to nurture the 70-plus small-scale economic experiments they had promoted: local currencies, Wi-Fi networks in the mountains, producer co-ops.</p> \n<p>But Dragasakis was given “operations”: to operate the government, to firefight the banking system, to sort out the state energy company. Those who expected his department to unleash a wave of entrepreneurship and experimental projects have had to wait.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e3ad7d8e66b4fd17ef9850059961212c77b58f9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435599060691/db11cf06-28f4-4f85-973a-fd8208eda35f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Probably the most challenging job in Greek journalism right now is to work for Avgi, Syriza’s newspaper. It is a daily, with professional graphic design, but suffers because nobody can decide whether it is meant to carry the party line or to be a voice for the mass base, and therefore a pain in Tsipras’s butt. When I meet editor-in-chief Giorgos Kiritsis, he is surrounded, almost symbolically, by fading newsprint and old posters. He chain-smokes and pulls up a Facebook page on which someone has posted a 50,000 drachma note with Kiritsis’s face on.</p> \n<p>Nobody knows what 50,000 drachmas will be worth if Greece defaults on its debts, but Kiritsis and his colleagues have for months been exposed to the basic dilemma of Syriza. It is a coalition – including the hard, pro-Moscow left who want that drachma note to become real; a centre around Tsipras who wanted to try to shrug off austerity within the euro; and former social democrats who want, at all costs, to do a deal with the lenders.</p> \n<p>It was not until 4 June that Tsipras became convinced that his original strategy – to go on paying the lenders while negotiating the fine detail of an accord that never seemed to come – was fruitless. It was at this point that the forces in Syriza realigned leftwards and the strategy of the troika (the ECB, IMF and European Commission) – which had always been to split Syriza, forcing Tsipras and his own moderates into a coalition government with the centre parties – was in tatters.</p> \n<p>The ultimate question for Syriza, with the banks closed and the referendum due, is: can it now function as a movement? It has ridden to power on the back of social movements but, unlike Podemos in Spain or Sinn F&eacute;in in Ireland, has never really been a mass movement itself.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3945b3ddbede563c2b7a3cf45c3761adc515ce9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435599495654/7a01ae56-55c8-4250-ab8c-70bd1badd4b0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Graffiti in Athens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Graffiti in Athens.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the middle-class suburb of Chalandri in northern Athens, the mayor, Simos Roussos, has to organise the referendum and simultaneously keep the machinery of government going. Roussos was elected on a joint slate between Syriza and Antarsya party. He tells me the council’s gas supplier refused a delivery on Monday – not on the grounds that he wouldn’t get paid, but on the grounds that he didn’t like what Syriza is doing.</p> \n<p>We meet at a council-run clinic where, after midday, the official GPs and psychiatrists give way to a team of volunteers. It is run this way because the austerity under the previous govenrment means they can’t staff the clinic with paid employees. The volunteers include doctors, psychologists and qualified pharmacists, but I find them engaged in the menial task of hand-sorting donated medicines. They note the sell-by dates, count the pills and sort them. This is Syriza’s mass base – but it is not Syriza.</p> \n<p>Syriza was always a party before it was a movement. The early polls taken since the referendum was called indicate it still has mass support. The unanswered question is whether it can hold the leftwing half of Greek society together amid this week of chaos.</p> \n<p>Nineta, one of the volunteers at the clinic, tells me people are frightened, but that she is totally behind what Syriza has done. The antidote to fear is solidarity, she says. But nobody is sure how much solidarity can survive if the banks stay closed.</p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435598408859/c8bb2cc0-97d7-466f-8272-89e33ecfeed6-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"A demonstration in front of the Greek parliament in Athens.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435599228581/43c97af9-962e-4d8a-9b6c-5645709b95e8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"People wait outside a closed National Bank of Greece branch in Athens.

That €34bn was added to the Greek debt. Greek pension funds, which were major private lenders, also suffered terrible losses. </p> \n<p>Then €48.2bn was used to bail out Greek banks which had been forced to take losses, weakening their ability to protect themselves and depositors. </p> \n<p>Lastly, €140bn has been spent on paying the original debts and interest. </p> \n<p>Less than 10% of the bailout money was left to be used by the government for reforming its economy and safeguarding weaker members of society.</p> \n<p>Greek government debt is still about €320bn, 78% of it owed to the troika.
