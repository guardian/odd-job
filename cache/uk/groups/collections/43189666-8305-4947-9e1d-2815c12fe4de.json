The dramatic move, after 48 hours of sensational developments in Greece’s long-running battles with creditors, was sparked by the call on Friday night by country’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras , for a referendum on its creditors’ demands. That prompted finance ministers of the eurozone to effectively put an end to his country’s five-year bailout by the International Monetary Fund, the ECB and the European commission.</p> \n<p> In a brief, televised address to the nation, Tsipras threw the blame on to the leaders of the eurozone. But he did not say how long the banks would remain shut, nor did he give details of how much individuals and companies would be allowed to withdraw once they reopened.</p> \n<p>In the early hours of Monday morning, Tsipras published a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/29/greek-debt-crisis-key-points-athens-bank-controls\">decree in the official government gazette</a> setting out the capital controls to be imposed on the country.</p> \n<p>The decree – entitled ‘Bank Holiday break’ – was signed by Tsipras and the Greek president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos.</p> \n<p>It said all banks would be kept shut until after the referendum on 5 July and withdrawals from cash machines would be limited to €60 – about &pound;40. Cash machines were not expected to reopen until later on Monday.</p> \n<p>Foreign transfers out of Greece are prohibited, although online transactions between Greek bank accounts are to continue as normal. Tsipras insisted pensions and wages would be unaffected by the controls.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/29/greek-debt-crisis-key-points-athens-bank-controls\">Greek debt crisis: the key points of Athens bank controls</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Greece’s finance ministry later announced that the strict ATM withdrawal limits would not apply to holders of credit or debit cards issued in foreign countries. This was seen as a necessary move after worries that tourists were seen joining locals in front of ATMs on Sunday. Any similar restriction would hurt tourism, Greece’s one thriving industry, which accounts for at least a fifth of economic activity.</p> \n<p> The prime minister said that Saturday’s move by the eurozone’s finance ministers to halt Greece’s bailout programme was unprecedented. He called it “a denial of the Greek public’s right to reach a democratic decision”.</p> \n<p> Tsipras added that the finance ministers’ initiative had prompted the ECB to curb its assistance, forcing the government to take the steps that it had. He said he had once again appealed for an extension of the bailout until after the referendum, on 5 July, sending his proposal to the president of the European council, Donald Tusk, the leaders of the 18 member states of the single currency, the commission and the ECB.</p> \n<p>As fears spread through Sunday that capital controls would need to be put in place, growing numbers of depositors lined up at ATMs, even in affluent city areas, to withdraw what cash they could.</p> \n<p>Drivers also flocked to gas stations across Greece, prompting the country’s largest refiner to issue a statement reassuring there are enough reserves. Refiner Hellenic Petroleum said: “We maintain fuel reserves for several months. The supply of our refineries with crude oil is also assured.”</p> \n<p> The country’s plight deteriorated sharply on Friday night when Tsipras put his country’s future in the balance by suddenly calling a referendum and arguing robustly for a rejection of the price set by his creditors for saving Greece, at least for a few more months. This Sunday’s vote will ask Greeks whether they approve or disapprove of the last offer tabled by the creditors before the negotiations broke down.</p> \n<p> But during a marathon parliamentary debate that ended in the early hours of Sunday morning, opposition leaders argued that it was, in fact, a vote on whether Greeks wished any longer to be part of the eurozone. It will be Greece’s first referendum since the country voted to abolish its monarchy in 1974.</p> \n<p> The European commission said on Sunday for the first time in the crisis that it wanted to offer Greece debt relief, Tsipras’s central demand during the five months of stalemated talks. Reports from Berlin said that Angela Merkel and Fran&ccedil;ois Hollande shared that view.</p> \n<p>But the potential concession appeared to come too late to prevent growing chaos in Greece – and sparked concerns across the Atlantic. Barack Obama was said to have called Merkel, the German chancellor, to urge her to take action. Jack Lew, the US Treasury secretary, urged creditors to offer debt relief to Greece.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/the-greeks-for-whom-all-the-talk-means-nothing-because-they-have-nothing\">The Greeks for whom all the talk means nothing – because they have nothing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Financial analysts will be watching the impact on the markets, which have not yet had the chance to react to the events of the last 48 hours. Mario Draghi, the president of the ECB, tightened the screws somewhat on the country.</p> \n<p> The governing council of the ECB decided to freeze emergency liquidity assistance to the Greek banks, the lifeline that is keeping the national financial system functioning. The ELA was capped at last Friday’s level of €89bn. It meant that the banks could continue to function, but the draining of money as people flocked to the ATMs to retrieve their savings also meant they would run out of money that could not be replenished by the central bank.</p> \n<p> “We continue to work closely with the Bank of Greece,” Draghi said.</p> \n<p> Greece’s financial stability committee, which includes the finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, and the central bank governor, Yannis Stournaras, met on Sunday evening to discuss Greece’s rapidly shrinking options. The high-level political confrontations on Friday and Saturday produced the greatest uncertainty over Greece and in the eurozone in the five-year debt saga.</p> \n<p> The fallout from the collapse of negotiations and the calling of the referendum brought recrimination on all sides and predictions of gloom.</p> \n<p> The German finance minister, Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, said he was “perplexed and depressed” by developments. Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who heads the committee of eurozone finance ministers, said that with his referendum call, Tsipras was thrusting the country into a mess from which it would struggle to recover.</p> \n<p> “We are millimetres away from the total collapse of the Greek financial system,” warned Herman Van Rompuy, until last year the president of the European council and heavily involved in years of Greek rescue negotiations. “It’s actually suicide that’s taking place in Greece right now.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/the-guardian-view-on-greece-and-the-euro-no-money-left\">The Guardian view on Greece and the euro: no money left | Editorial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> The restrictions being imposed are anathema to Tsipras’s radical left-led government – all the more so since it desperately needs to keep public opinion on its side ahead of the referendum.</p> \n<p> Varoufakis told the BBC in a Sunday interview: “Capital controls within a monetary union are a contradiction in terms.” But he was party to Sunday night’s decision.</p> \n<p> In the early hours of Sunday, parliament voted 178 to 120 in favour of holding the referendum. Embarrassingly for the government, the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn movement joined Tsipras’s Syriza party and its populist rightwing coalition partner, ANEL, in backing the proposal.</p> \n<p> By Sunday evening, however, it had not received the necessary endorsement of Greece’s president, Prokopis Pavlopoulos.</p> \n<p> According to two polls published on Sunday, Tsipras faces an uphill battle to secure the rejection he has indicated that he favours. One in the right-leaning tabloid Proto Thema found 57% of those interviewed favoured acceptance of the creditors’ latest offer. Another in the centre-left To Vima put support at 47%.</p> \n<p> </p>","section":"World","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a988b054a5402639a1992cde951a16178a3127c1/0_0_3500_2100/3500.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2100,"width":3500,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"STRINGER/Reuters","altText":"Greek citizens line up to withdraw cash from a cash machine on the island of Crete","cleanCredit":"Photograph: STRINGER/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-29T06:26:23Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T07:13:18Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":1744,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian Traynor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/iantraynor"},{"name":"John Hooper","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/johnhooper"},{"name":"Helena Smith","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/helenasmith"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Greece","Eurozone crisis","Europe","Alexis Tsipras","World news","Banking","Business","Economics","Euro","Currencies","European Central Bank","European Union","European banks","European monetary union","Financial crisis","Financial sector","Euro","Stock markets"],"tags":[{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"business/financial-crisis","webTitle":"Financial crisis"},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector"},{"id":"world/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/stock-markets","webTitle":"Stock markets"}],"section":{"id":"world"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"world"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-deepens-banks-close-a-week-weekend-shook-euro","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7he","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-deepens-banks-close-a-week-weekend-shook-euro","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-deepens-banks-close-a-week-weekend-shook-euro"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerVideo":{"id":"gu-video-457298641","source":"Reuters","durationInSeconds":40,"formats":[{"mimeType":"video/mp4","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/06/29/150629ATMs_FromGAus-16x9.mp4"},{"mimeType":"video/m3u8","uri":"http://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/06/29/150629ATMs_FromGAus/150629ATMs_FromGAus.m3u8"}],"stillImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435538974983/Greek-ATM-001.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":360,"width":640,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The lines at the Greek bank ATMs grew longer in the early hours of Monday (June 29), after the government moved to check the growing strains on its crippled financial system.

Creditors must rethink a failed austerity policy, and the political risk of painting themselves as the enemies of the Greek people</p>","byline":"Editorial","body":"<p>Something was bound to snap in Greece, and now it has. Over six years, jobs have vanished, hope has been smothered and a generation of progress in living standards has been reversed. <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/102395651\">Suicides soared</a> among stricken individuals, and the collective sense of sovereignty shrivelled. The nation has been crucified on the cross of a currency that it should never have been allowed to join. It awakes to discover <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-emergency-liquidity-referendum-bailout-live#block-55902ec0e4b024248ae9a554\">the extent of restrictions</a> on accessing its bank accounts.</p> \n<p>Step back from the immediate row over proposals and counter-proposals, under which Alexis Tsipras drew a sharp line on Friday with his <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/27/greece-bailout-referendum-ramps-up-eurozone-crisis?CMP=share_btn_tw\">midnight pledge for a referendum</a>, and this is the real backdrop to Athens’s abrupt decision to stop playing the European game. Fiery and inexperienced, the Greek prime minister has breached all the rules of diplomacy, failing to warn his counterparts about his plebiscite before going public, and perhaps depriving himself of a last bit of leverage in the haggling over bailout terms. His rhetoric contrasts his own mandate with the presumptions of callous technocrats, ignoring the mandates of creditor governments. That threatens the space in which a European club of 28 members is fated to find compromise. And the question he will put to the voters – whether they accept the creditors’ terms for extending a bailout that is now set to finish five days before Sunday’s vote – is arguably a nonsense.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-deepens-banks-close-a-week-weekend-shook-euro\">Greece crisis deepens as banks close for a week after weekend that shook euro</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>No surprise, then, that the initial response of the eurozone finance ministers meeting in Brussels was to insist that the bailout would indeed end on Tuesday. Greece’s Yanis Varoufakis, the sole dissenter, had to pack his bags. A mood of “let Greece go” was taking hold. But by Sunday evening, there were signs of second thoughts. After briefing that it would not be able to provide the Greek authorities with the extra euros required to keep cashpoints working, the European Central Bank clarified that pre-existing assistance was not being cut off. The European commission published the creditors’ previously take-it-or-leave-it proposal, but now insisted that the plan had always been to marry this stringent short-term scheme with debt relief down the road. Soon <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/live/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-emergency-liquidity-referendum-bailout-live#block-55901275e4b024248ae9a50f\">Christine Lagarde of the IMF</a>, too, put out a statement advocating debt relief and further talks.</p> \n<p>The creditors’ rethink could be a ruse to destabilise Mr Tsipras ahead of his make-or-break vote. But let’s hope it is sincere. If the markets have seen one corner of the eurozone break away, there will be permanent and costly speculation about where the next crack will be. The creditors need to have the humility to recognise that their austerity programme has failed. None of the hardship has made Greek debt more sustainable, yet still they demand more. The loss of about 5% of UK national income in 2008 could be answered by pumping in <a href=\"http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100407010852/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/prebud_pbr08_repindex.htm\">a fiscal injection of 1% GDP</a>. Greece, where 25% of the economy has disappeared, is instead asked to offer up a fiscal blood donation, whose direct effect is withdrawing 1% of demand.</p> \n<p>Most fundamentally, an EU whose democratic credentials are under populist assault from Britain to Budapest needs to avoid reinforcing a damaging caricature. It helped <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2011/nov/03/papandreou-scraps-greek-referendum-euro\">kill the Greek government of George Papandreou</a> after he had proposed a controversial referendum on bailout terms in 2011. Strong-arming a second administration out of consulting a suffering populace could look dangerously like haughty contempt. A club of democracies cannot afford to set itself up against even one demos.</p>","section":"Opinion","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a34a31a245174ec1f41e20e7225c44accd1d44c4/151_1131_1059_636/1059.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":636,"width":1059,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP","altText":"Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Daniel Ochoa de Olza/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-28T19:07:01Z","lastModified":"2015-06-29T07:45:00Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Greece","Eurozone crisis","Europe","World news","Euro","European Union","Economics","Euro","European monetary union","Currencies","European Central Bank","Business","Banking","European banks","Financial crisis","Financial sector","Eurozone","Yanis Varoufakis","Syriza"],"tags":[{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/economics","webTitle":"Economics"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"business/currencies","webTitle":"Currencies"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"business/banking","webTitle":"Banking"},{"id":"business/europeanbanks","webTitle":"European banks"},{"id":"business/financial-crisis","webTitle":"Financial crisis"},{"id":"business/financial-sector","webTitle":"Financial sector"},{"id":"business/eurozone","webTitle":"Eurozone"},{"id":"world/yanis-varoufakis","webTitle":"Yanis Varoufakis"},{"id":"world/syriza","webTitle":"Syriza"}],"section":{"id":"commentisfree"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"commentisfree"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/the-guardian-view-on-greece-and-the-euro-no-money-left","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7h9","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/world/2015/jun/28/the-guardian-view-on-greece-and-the-euro-no-money-left","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/28/the-guardian-view-on-greece-and-the-euro-no-money-left"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/a34a31a245174ec1f41e20e7225c44accd1d44c4/151_1131_1059_636/1059.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":636,"width":1059,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Greece’s Yanis Varoufakis was the only finance minister to argue against the end of the bailout in Brussels.

Few at the time paid much heed to the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife as they drove through the streets of Sarajevo. Within six weeks, however, Europe was at war.</p> \n<p>Make no mistake, the decision by Alexis Tsipras to hold a referendum on the bailout terms being demanded of his country has the potential to be a Sarajevo moment. The crisis is not just about whether there is soon to be a bank run in Greece, although there is certainly the threat of one. It is not just about whether the creditors overplayed their hand in the negotiations, although they did. It is about the future of the euro itself.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-decide-emergency-funding\">Greek banks to stay closed on Monday</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There will be much talk in the next few days about how Greece can be quarantined. The three people who have been leading the negotiations for the troika - Christine Lagarde of the International Monetary Fund, Jean-Claude Juncker of the European commission and Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank - can still cling to the hope that Tsipras will lose the referendum next Sunday.</p> \n<p>In those circumstances, the Syriza-led coalition would have little choice but to hold an election. The return of a government headed by, for example, the centre-right New Democracy, would open up the possibility that Athens would sue for peace on the terms demanded by the troika.</p> \n<p>There is, however, no guarantee of this. The troika was certain last week that Tsipras would fold when presented with a final take-it-or-leave-it offer. They were wrong. The Fund, the ECB and the European commission made a fatal misjudgement and have now lost control of events.</p> \n<p>The immediate decision for the ECB was whether to cut off emergency funding before the country’s bailout programme formally ends on Tuesday. Wisely, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/greek-crisis-ecb-decide-emergency-funding\">it has chosen not to make matters worse</a>.</p> \n<p> In recent weeks, the Greek banks have only been able to stay open because Draghi has provided funds to compensate for capital flight. Sunday night’s announcement of an emergency bank holiday and capital controls demonstrates just how critical the situation has become.</p> \n<p>Germany strongly supports the immediate end to emergency liquidity assistance (ELA), arguing that taxpayers in the rest of Europe should not be further exposed to the risk of a Greek exit from the single currency. The ECB, however, has always been reluctant to take what would clearly be a political decision to escalate the pressure on the Greek banks, and has announced that it will continue providing funding at last week’s level. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-disaster-athens-collosal-failure-eu\">Greece crisis: a disaster for Athens and a colossal failure for the EU</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even so, Greece now faces a week of turmoil. Tsipras bowed what seemed to be inevitable on Sunday by announcing controls to try to prevent Northern Rock-style queues outside the banks and - just as importantly - money leaving the country.</p> \n<p>The Greek government will also be making contingency plans for exit from the single currency. Tsipras and Yannis Varoufakis, his finance minister, say that is not their wish or intention, but if the result of the referendum backs the government’s stance it is hard to see any alternative. Cyprus stayed in the euro after introducing capital controls, but it was done with the approval of other single currency members and involved knuckling down under an austerity programme.</p> \n<p>In the meantime, the blame game has begun. The creditors say they offered Greece a deal that would have secured future financing in return for reforms and budget savings which would have hastened the country’s economic recovery. Lagarde has said there is now nothing on the table and that Greece should not expect the same terms to be available after the referendum.</p> \n<p>Tsipras said the troika was proposing an “extortionate ultimatum” of “strict and humiliating austerity without end”. A spokesman for Varoufakis said the referendum meant the end to five years of “waterboarding”.</p> \n<p>The stance taken by the troika has been wrong-headed but inevitable. Greece has seen its economy shrink by 25% in the past five years. A quarter of its population is unemployed. It has suffered a slump of Great Depression proportions, yet the troika has been demanding fresh tax increases that will suck demand from the economy, stifle growth and add to Greece’s debt burden.</p> \n<p>If Greece were outside the euro, IMF advice would be different. The fund would be telling Greece to devalue its currency. It would be telling the country’s creditors that they would have to take a “haircut” in order to make Greece’s debts sustainable. It would then justify domestic austerity on the grounds that the benefits of the devaluation should not be frittered away in higher inflation.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/28/the-greeks-for-whom-all-the-talk-means-nothing-because-they-have-nothing\">The Greeks for whom all the talk means nothing - because they have nothing</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This option, though, has not been made available to Greece. It is unable to devalue and European governments are resistant to the idea of a debt write-down. So the only way Greece can make itself more competitive is to cut costs, by reducing wages and pensions.</p> \n<p>A fully fledged monetary union has the means to transfer resources from one region to another. This is what happens in the US or the UK, for example, with higher taxes in areas that are doing well being redistributed to areas with slower growth and higher unemployment.</p> \n<p>The euro, however, was constructed along different lines. Countries were allowed to join even though it was clear they would struggle to compete with the better performing nations such as Germany. A stability and growth pact designed to ensure a common set of budget controls was a poor substitute for fiscal union. From the start, it was obvious that the only mechanism for a country that ran into severe difficulties would be harsh austerity. Greece is the result of what happens when politics is allowed to override economics.</p> \n<p>If Greece leaves, the idea that the euro is irrevocable is broken. Any government that runs into difficulties in the future will have the Greek option of devaluation as an alternative to endless austerity. Just as importantly, the financial markets will know that, and will pile pressure on countries that look vulnerable. That’s why Greece represents an existential crisis for the eurozone. </p> \n<p>It will be said in response that Greece is a small, insignificant country and that the single currency has much better defences than it had at the last moment of acute trouble in the summer of 2012. Diplomats in Europe’s capitals took very much the same view in late June 1914.</p>","section":"Business","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435504738331/685ef9b8-dc02-423a-a04d-c655b55e5359-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Design Pics Inc/Rex/Design Pics Inc/Rex","altText":"Franz Ferdinand Archduke of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg moments before they were assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Design Pics Inc/Rex/Design Pics Inc/Rex"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-28T18:15:46Z","lastModified":"2015-06-28T23:50:02Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":902,"contributors":[{"name":"Larry Elliott","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733742341/LarryElliott.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/larryelliott"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Eurozone","Eurozone crisis","Business","World news","Syriza","Euro","Europe","European Union","European monetary union","Greece","Germany","Alexis Tsipras","Yanis Varoufakis","Austerity","European Central Bank"],"tags":[{"id":"business/eurozone","webTitle":"Eurozone"},{"id":"business/debt-crisis","webTitle":"Eurozone crisis"},{"id":"business/business","webTitle":"Business"},{"id":"world/world","webTitle":"World news"},{"id":"world/syriza","webTitle":"Syriza"},{"id":"business/euro","webTitle":"Euro"},{"id":"world/europe-news","webTitle":"Europe"},{"id":"world/eu","webTitle":"European Union"},{"id":"business/emu","webTitle":"European monetary union"},{"id":"world/greece","webTitle":"Greece"},{"id":"world/germany","webTitle":"Germany"},{"id":"world/alexis-tsipras","webTitle":"Alexis Tsipras"},{"id":"world/yanis-varoufakis","webTitle":"Yanis Varoufakis"},{"id":"business/austerity","webTitle":"Austerity"},{"id":"business/european-central-bank","webTitle":"European Central Bank"}],"section":{"id":"business"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Larry Elliott","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/larryelliott"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"business"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#e6711b","navigationDownColour":"#f39f33","ruleColour":"#e6711b","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#e6711b","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#e3e1dc","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#36711b","iconColour":"#676767","kickerColour":"#e6711b","colourPalette":"comment"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-eurozone-sarajevo-moment","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a7ab","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/business/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-eurozone-sarajevo-moment","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-eurozone-sarajevo-moment"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435504738331/685ef9b8-dc02-423a-a04d-c655b55e5359-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Franz Ferdinand Archduke of Austria and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg moments before they were assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914.

Flowers, too. </p> \n<p>The caravan is old, but spotless. It is home to Georgios Karvouniaris, 61, and his sister Barbara, 64, two Greeks for whom all the Brussels wrangling over VAT rates, corporation tax and pension reforms has meant nothing – because they have nothing, no income of any kind.</p> \n<p>Next Sunday’s referendum – which, if the country stays solvent that long, will either send Greece back to the negotiating table with its creditors or precipitate its exit from the eurozone – is unlikely to affect them much either. </p> \n<p>“I do not see how any of it will change our lives. I have no hope, anyway,” said Georgios, sitting in a scavenged plastic garden chair beneath a parasol liberated from a skip.</p> \n<p>After seven years of a crisis that has left 26% of Greece’s workforce unemployed, 30% of its people below the poverty line, 17% unable to meet their daily food needs and 3.1 million without health insurance, it is hard to see how anything decided in Brussels or in Athens in the coming week will do much to change the lives of a large number of Greeks any time soon. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-disaster-athens-collosal-failure-eu\">Greece crisis: a disaster for Athens and a colossal failure for the EU</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Those that were already on the margins have been pushed right to the very, very edge, and those who were in the middle have been pushed to the margins,” said Ioanna Pertsinidou of Praksis, a charity that runs day centres for vulnerable people and offers legal and employment advice.</p> \n<p>“So many people – ordinary, low-to-middle income people with jobs and homes and their lives on track – have seen their lives go drown the drain so fast,” Pertsinidou said. “People who never dreamed that one day they would not be able to pay their electricity bill, or feed their children properly.”</p> \n<p>As it has scrabbled for every last cent to satisfy its creditors and ward off bankruptcy, Greece’s government has taken cash wherever it could – local authorities, healthcare, pensions, social services have all been tapped. In a country of 11 million people, public spending is now €65bn (&pound;45.6bn) less than it was in 2010. “There is no safety net left,” said Pertsinidou.</p> \n<p>No one need tell that to the Karvouniaris family. Georgios is a stern man, still strong, smartly shaven and dressed in a clean green polo short and jeans. His sister, remarkably jovial, wears black for their younger brother Vangelis, who died of nobody will say exactly what two years ago next month, aged 52. He spent a brief week in hospital before his death, for which his siblings recently received a €2,000 bill – which they managed to get written off.</p> \n<p>Until March 2013, the three lived in an apartment a mile or so away that they had shared since 1980. None of them had ever married. It worked well. Georgios, a welder and mechanic before becoming a bank security guard, and Vangelis, a salesman, shoe repairer and, latterly, gardener, were the breadwinners. Barbara cooked, cleaned and looked after her brothers.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/jun/28/greece-europe-imf-democracy\">The moral crusade against Greece must be opposed | Zoe Williams</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Quite early in Greece’s crisis, Vangelis lost his job. Then in February 2011, Georgios lost his at the Agrotiki bank, where he had worked for 12 years. After leaving school at 12 and working ever since, Georgios got €465 unemployment benefit for eight months, then €200 for a year, then nothing. </p> \n<p>The rent on the apartment was €250. “We spent all we had,” he said. “Our savings. We sold Barbara’s jewellery, for half its worth. We tried to sell this patch of land but no one would buy it. For the first time in 30 years, we didn’t pay our rent. By the end we couldn’t even afford food.”</p> \n<p>If the Karvouniarises are not now sleeping rough, it is because a neighbour saw them sitting in tears outside their apartment building, formally threatened with eviction and all packed up but with nowhere to go. They had not eaten for three days.</p> \n<p>It took time, but Despina Moragianis – a relative of that neighbour – and her friends, Ann Papastavrou and Niki Festas, women in their 60s, rallied their women’s group in Halandri. </p> \n<p>Twenty-odd people, none wealthy, pitched in to buy the 15-year-old caravan, which was towed to the Kourvaniaris family’s small plot, once intended as Barbara’s dowry. </p> \n<p>For 13 months there was no water, but a campaign by the women persuaded the Gerakas town hall to fit a standpipe in May last year. Later, the group raised €1,000 to have it plumbed into the caravan and a septic tank dug, so the toilet works. The next target is a solar panel for electricity.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"264f11466b5293ea1171d057a65070d1dc00d378\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435516026559/793e2377-0092-4b51-9608-19c656983d79-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Georgios Karvouniaris and his sister Barbara outside their caravan\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgios Karvouniaris and his sister Barbara outside their caravan.

Fresh meat is once a week. Non-perishables – spaghetti, rice, flour, condensed milk, tomato sauce – come from the food bank.</p> \n<p>And so the Karvouniaris siblings survive. Georgios digs, recycles what he can find on the streets, takes long walks and dreams of fresh milk. No electricity means no fridge. Barbara cooks – there is a gas stove – cleans, washes clothes and tends her garden.</p> \n<p>The couple have no money – a friendly town hall official paid their latest €18 water bill out of his own pocket – and no hope of any until Georgios qualifies for his pension at 67. “I’d hoped it might be 65, in four years’ time, but they’ve just recently decided to raise the age limit,” he said. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/28/greece-crisis-eurozone-sarajevo-moment\">Greece crisis could be a Sarajevo moment for the eurozone</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>He is not sure how much he will get even then. Pensions have been a major stumbling block in Greece’s aid-for-reforms talks with its creditors, who want further savings from a system whose benefits have already been cut by 45%, leaving nearly half of Greece’s pensioners below the monthly poverty threshold of €665. <br /></p> \n<p>It is not just pensioners in penury. Under a limited relief programme promised by the Syriza party during its election victory in January, more than 300,000 of the poorest Greek households applied last month for food aid, a small rent allowance and to have their electricity reconnected for free. </p> \n<p>So far the government has found the money to pay a small housing benefit to precisely 1,073 people, the social solidarity minister, Theano Fotiou, admitted. The €70 a month grocery voucher Georgios and Barbara were promised under the scheme – “We have no house and no power, so there was nothing else we qualified for,” said Georgios – has yet to materialise.</p> \n<p>Barbara’s face briefly clouds. How does she feel about the way they have been treated? “Disgusted,” she said, quietly. “Just … disgusted.” She smiles again. “But we’ve been lucky. There are people who have nowhere to sleep at all.”</p> \n<p>According to a University of Crete study earlier this year, there are now 17,700 people without proper and secure housing in Athens alone. Some sleep rough or in cars, others camp with friends or relatives, or live in squats and hostels. </p> \n<p>A majority are in their own homes, threatened with imminent eviction because they are among the estimated 320,000 Greek families who have fallen behind with a mortgage or other payment to their bank. </p> \n<p>Two are in a small donated caravan, living on food donated by a group of Greek women. Georgios is grateful, but he also gets angry sometimes. “I have worked all my life. I’ve paid my taxes all my life,” he said. </p> \n<p>“I’m 61 years old and if it wasn’t for the generosity of people who three years ago we had never met, we would be sleeping on a bench.
