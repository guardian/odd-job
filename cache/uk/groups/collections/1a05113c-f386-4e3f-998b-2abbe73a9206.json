Mark Ronson played his first full live set in three years on the Other stage on Friday, and it should be no surprise that he used every tool in his years of DJing experience to build the crowd’s reaction to an astounding crescendo. </p> \n<p>One of the most well-connected men in the business obviously had guests, and a lot of them. He brought out Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker for a riff-off over Daffodils, and Daniel Merriweather for Stop Me, and Kyle Falconer from the View for The Bike Song. He was, undoubtedly, “really glad to be here, and that’s no BS”, introducing every collaborator with the enthusiasm of a schoolboy who cannot quite believe his luck. He played keyboards, and he scratched, and he played guitar, on top of a kind of heightened drum riser, from which he stared out at the crowd with what can only be described as a look of being extremely chuffed indeed, as BMX riders and jump-rope dancers added flair to the flashing lights disco staging. </p> \n<p>But he saved the best for the last 20 minutes, and what an exquisite run it was. Andrew White, of Miike Snow fame, glowing in an emerald suit, co-wrote the hugely underrated Somebody to Love Me from 2010’s Record Collection. Any performance of it wouldn’t be complete without “the boy who sang this song” – Boy George, who looked thrilled to be on stage, in top hat and dreadlocks, also singing so beautifully, “Nobody’s gonna save my life.” And of course, if you have Boy George, then it would be a shame to waste him, so the crowd got a cover Do You Really Want to Hurt Me. “What an honour it is to be on stage with Boy George,” said Ronson, ever the gentleman, as the crowd couldn’t quite believe its luck. </p> \n<p>Two Glastonbury moments to go. In what felt like a genuinely teary moment, Ronson introduced Valerie, which the band played along to <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/music/amywinehouse\">Amy Winehouse</a>’s original vocal. She was, he said, one of the greatest singers the world has ever known – how could they replace her? “I know we all wish Amy was here tonight,” he said, and asked the crowd to sing her part. They replied with respect, with gusto, with a “were you there?” experience.</p> \n<p>Finally, there was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/may/01/mark-ronson-uptown-funk-gains-five-new-writers\">Uptown Funk</a>. If Ronson had simply played it to a track of Bruno Mars’s vocal, the audience would have gone wild, given that it is undeniably an irresistible tune. Instead, he went above and beyond. It was, frankly, ridiculously good, an imaginary dinner-party band line-up, the stuff of music dreams: Grandmaster Flash, George Clinton and Mary J Blige combined to hit your hallelujah. That’s only the inventor of hip-hop, the prime minister of funk, and one of the finest soul vocalists of all time. Mark Ronson looked overwhelmed to have pulled it off, but he did, outstandingly. What a show. </p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/9f1e325f0ef71432e94c3406e837cb75ad1a28d8/0_139_2172_1303/2172.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1303,"width":2172,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Angela Lubrano/LIVEPIX","altText":"MARK RONSON\r\rGLASTONBURY  FESTIVAL 2015\r\r26/6/2015\r\rPHOTOGRAPH BY:  ANGELA LUBRANO\rPLEASE CONTACT: LIVEPIX\r\r\rMobile :    07958 961 625\re-mail: live@livepix.biz","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Angela Lubrano/LIVEPIX"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-26T22:08:45Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T00:18:51Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":70,"contributors":[{"name":"Rebecca Nicholson","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/6/3/1433328474752/Rebecca-Nicholson-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/rebeccanicholson"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Glastonbury 2015","Mark Ronson","Music","Culture","Music festivals","Glastonbury festival","Festivals","Pop and rock","Mary J Blige","George Clinton"],"tags":[{"id":"music/glastonbury-2015","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2015"},{"id":"music/mark-ronson","webTitle":"Mark Ronson"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"music/music-festivals","webTitle":"Music festivals"},{"id":"music/glastonbury","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"music/mary-j-blige","webTitle":"Mary J Blige"},{"id":"music/georgeclinton","webTitle":"George Clinton"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Rebecca Nicholson","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/rebeccanicholson"}}],"starRating":"5","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/26/mark-ronson-at-glastonbury-2015-review-mary-j-blige-kevin-parker-daniel-merriweather-kyle-falconer","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a3ym","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jun/26/mark-ronson-at-glastonbury-2015-review-mary-j-blige-kevin-parker-daniel-merriweather-kyle-falconer","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/26/mark-ronson-at-glastonbury-2015-review-mary-j-blige-kevin-parker-daniel-merriweather-kyle-falconer"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/9f1e325f0ef71432e94c3406e837cb75ad1a28d8/0_139_2172_1303/2172.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1303,"width":2172,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An imaginary dinner-party band line-up … Mark Ronson.

The dance-pop group turn their grab-bag of funk and electronic influences into a combination of nostalgic magic and new material that triumphantly wins over the post-Caribou punters at the West Holts stage. Hot Chip understand how to please a crowd, dropping singalong-ready Over and Over into their set a few songs in, but also balance the process of teasing and rewarding the audience with slow-burning tracks and the odd banger. They closed with a Dancing in the Dark cover, replete with flashing multi-coloured lights and the crowd singing. Overall, it’s a blissful, thumping return to Worthy Farm’s sprawl, finished off with a Dancing in the Dark cover starring members of Caribou and Sinkane. And indie discos, be damned.</p> \n</blockquote> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"four stars\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;style&gt; .title { display:block;} .face { width: 80px; height: 80px; margin: 0 -5px;} &lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;img class=&quot;title&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/ratinglabel.598b8588.png&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot; /&gt;\n&lt;img class=&quot;face&quot; src=&quot;http://interactive.guim.co.uk/thrashers/glastonbury-treat/hashed/eavis-happy.f2eef7b0.png&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure>","postType":"blog"},{"id":"block-558dd624e4b0c9bda8d8a7a3","publishedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:46:31Z","lastUpdatedDateTime":"2015-06-26T22:50:49Z","body":"<h2>It’s the Foo Fighters cover now on BBC2</h2> \n<p>… if you haven’t already seen it on iPlayer.

The warm-up DJ plays a Foo Fighters track and you’re reminded just how massive it would have been if they’d have played on the Pyramid stage tonight. But instead we have Rudimental and a mass of people slipping and sliding to their drum’n’bass drops. For this sound system, however, it’s carnival 365 days a year. Their set is a constant shape shifting coterie of guest singers, jumping hype men, pogoing brass players and anthems that pump harder than a Fitness First at peak time. In fact, watching them bound across the stage is enough to convince you to sign up to one on Monday. </p> \n <p data-dropid=\"1\">Not Giving In, dedicated to DJ Locksmith’s five year old son, is a singalong high as is when they trot out funk hero George Clinton for their “soul” moment, to sing their motto “spread love, go far” and blast peace signs from the screens. A bit over-egged, perhaps, but then Rudimental aren’t usually ones for subtlety.

Bastille, Foals and even One Direction were touted as possible surprise replacements for the slot Florence + the Machine left bare when Foo Fighters had to pull out, but an Instagram snap from a Worthy Farm-bound private helicopter confirmed it was the reformed indie heroes – fresh from Pete Doherty’s recent stint in a Thai rehab clinic. </p> \n<p>They open with a limp version of Vertigo, which plods along like a Monday morning rehearsal rather than Friday-night Glastonbury showdown. But then Pete Doherty addresses the crowd, looking out over a golden sunset, to pay tribute to his friend and collaborator Alan Wass, who died of a heart attack earlier in the year. “If you’re looking down, I’m looking up,” he mutters. They’re brief, but tender words that show Doherty is still very much the wordsmith. </p> \n<p>The set rattles on with a home-for-dinnertime mendacity: Horrorshow is sloppy and rigid, and the cor blimey drawl of The Boy Looked At Johnny – written when Razorlight’s Johnny Borrell was still in the band, feels staid and dated. </p> \n<p>Time For Heroes, Can’t Stand Me Now and What Katie Did, however, are triumphant set-savers; the crowd roar as Pete and Carl recreate their now iconic album sleeve pose, face-to-face, brothers in arms. Their matching Libertines tattoos are still prominent – and doubtless there are legions of fans in the crowd tonight with replicas inked onto their own skin. </p> \n<p>As the set closes with a victorious Don’t Look Back into The Sun, they tumble to the ground and kiss in a defiant moment of carefree abandon. It’s a rare spark in tonight’s set that captures the true heart of the Libertines – the incendiary romanticism between Pete and Carl, that incendiary love-hate relationship that lead to their spectacular break-up after just two albums. </p> \n<p>The legend of the Libertines, however, has always lain in what was and might have been, rather than what is now. A handful of new tracks do little to distract from the notion that tonight’s set was about whimsical nostalgia rather than a new-found fire. Again, it feels like another missed opportunity. </p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/574f9b9de1f705d772ca5252430b866003731fdc/0_24_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jim Dyson/Getty Images","altText":"The Libertines Glastonbury 2015","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jim Dyson/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-26T23:11:55Z","lastModified":"2015-06-27T00:13:28Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":27,"contributors":[{"name":"Jenny Stevens","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2015/6/16/1434440987599/Jenny-Stevens-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jenny-stevens"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Glastonbury 2015","The Libertines","Glastonbury festival","Festivals","Culture","Music","Music festivals","Indie","Pop and rock","Pete Doherty","Carl Barât"],"tags":[{"id":"music/glastonbury-2015","webTitle":"Glastonbury 2015"},{"id":"music/libertines","webTitle":"The Libertines"},{"id":"music/glastonbury","webTitle":"Glastonbury festival"},{"id":"culture/festivals","webTitle":"Festivals"},{"id":"culture/culture","webTitle":"Culture"},{"id":"music/music","webTitle":"Music"},{"id":"music/music-festivals","webTitle":"Music festivals"},{"id":"music/indie","webTitle":"Indie"},{"id":"music/popandrock","webTitle":"Pop and rock"},{"id":"music/petedoherty","webTitle":"Pete Doherty"},{"id":"music/carl-barat","webTitle":"Carl Barât"}],"section":{"id":"music"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jenny Stevens","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jenny-stevens"}}],"starRating":"3","embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"music"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#ffce4b","navigationDownColour":"#ffdc7d","ruleColour":"#ffce4b","headlineColour":"#ffffff","headlineAccentColour":"#ffce4b","starColour":"#ffce4b","starEmptyColour":"#70695e","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#7d7569","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#70695e","kickerColour":"#ffce4b","colourPalette":"review"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jun/27/the-libertines-at-glastonbury-2015-review-whimsical-nostalgia","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4a6hx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/music/2015/jun/27/the-libertines-at-glastonbury-2015-review-whimsical-nostalgia","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/27/the-libertines-at-glastonbury-2015-review-whimsical-nostalgia"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/574f9b9de1f705d772ca5252430b866003731fdc/0_24_3000_1800/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1800,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A home-for-dinnertime mendacity … the Libertines.

But it’s cool, it’s a big part of my identity, just making people happy. And I think a lot of culture starts at the table. So much of the young generation’s culture revolves around going out for dinner with friends, it’s a new identity. They don’t have cash, they don’t have much, but the money that they do have, they spend with their friends..</p> \n<p><strong>So do you see the dance floor and the table as going together?<br /></strong>They go hand in hand, definitely. Times aren’t the best for everyone, the Conservatives have come back in, and so when you have some cash you want to go out and have a drink with your friends.</p> \n<p><strong>You’ve been DJing for a long time now. Did you want the chance to do something a bit more relaxing for work as well?<br /></strong>I’m 30 this year and I’m starting to look at my life in a different way. You can be a rebel and be fun but now I want a family, I want to do other things, and I don’t want to be a DJ forever. I want other things in life besides parties and late nights. You have to keep yourself interested – the thing that keeps you living is learning new things. I don’t want to be a one-trick pony.</p> \n<p><strong>We’re here at The Beat Hotel, where you’re doing Smokey Tails, your barbecue food. What’s the idea behind it?<br /></strong>We were into barbecue and my family has a secret barbecue sauce. So for one festival we did a VIP barbecue and we did cocktails and we thought, Smokey Tails! We started a popup in Dalston and then we got involved in crazy east London gangster stuff with the neighbours, so then it took us another year to find a new space and we’ve been doing catering ever since and kept the dream alive. I really do feel that it’s the best barbecue in London! Finally we got this new space at the Old Street roundabout and that’s due to open in September. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"065ae972f2507f4604ac464c5e8c25a1117e5715\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/065ae972f2507f4604ac464c5e8c25a1117e5715/0_0_2432_3648/667.jpg\" alt=\"Seth Troxler, centre, with Amanda Sheppard, left, and India Langton at the 2014 Unicef Halloween Ball in London.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Seth Troxler, centre, with Amanda Sheppard, left, and India Langton at the 2014 Unicef Halloween Ball in London.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Young/Rex Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Where did the sauce recipe come from?<br /></strong>My grandfather, a Native American man from <a href=\"http://www.kalamazoocity.org/\">Kalamazoo [Michigan]</a>, first made the sauce for me when I was eight years old. And then when I was 20, he got cancer and he took me aside and taught me the family sauce. It’s my responsibility to keep him alive through making it. </p> \n<p><strong>Have you always wanted to bring food to festivals, to raise the quality of festival food?<br /></strong>A little bit, yeah. I’m the guy who goes to a festival and eats everything, like when you get sick from festival food. In America, festival food is a bit better, I think. But the main thing I found is that no one in Europe was doing smoked meat like how we do it in the US. It’s almost like our national food. I was going to these different places in London but it wasn’t doing it for me. I mean, there’s Nando’s grilled chicken but that’s not really the same.</p> \n<p><strong>But if you had the opportunity to get a <a href=\"http://www.nandos.co.uk/faq/what-high-5black-card\">Nando’s Black Card</a>, you’d do it, right?<br /></strong>Totally.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-audio\" data-canonical-url=\"https://soundcloud.com/katehutchinson/seth-troxler-does-shia-labeouf-impression\"> \n <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"460\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F212115423&amp;show_artwork=true\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>I saw you play last night in Silver Hayes with J.E.S.u.S. [his house music supergroup with Jackmaster, Skream and Eats Everything]. Why did you decide to form a supergroup?<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></strong>It’s just because we’re friends and wanting to have a reason to hang out with each other more often. Every time we see each other it’s like we’re reliving our boyhood. We actually did a J.E.S.u.S.<strong tabindex=\"-1\"> </strong>tour in a bus around England, it was ridiculous. At one point, it was raining and Jackmaster tried to climb on top of the bus. Jack and Oliver [<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/music/2015/jan/16/skream-favourite-tracks-jackmaster\">Skream</a>] are like Sid Vicious reincarnated. </p> \n<p>That’s cool for society, though. I remember as a kid growing up you had these really alternative figures, who were not good looking and just cool and punk. They were like, ”Fuck society, I’m just being me”. Today the idea of celebrity and the people who the media focus on are creating a really dumb image for kids to look up to. That affects their values – they’re into materialism and not focusing on core human values.</p> \n<p><strong>Like partying?<br /></strong>Like getting loose and exploring your mind! And trying to figure out who you are as a person. That’s part of going to festivals and going to club nights and hanging out with people, especially when you’re in your early 20s. So in some ways by being a rebel you can just show people that you should be who you are. Fuck it man, be cool, have a pulled pork sandwich.</p> \n<p><strong>How do you balance it all, being a superstar DJ and now a restauranter?<br /></strong>I come from a lower-middle class background so hard work was always pushed into me.

Following last year’s headline set from Metallica, Ian Fraser Kilminster marches on to the smoke-clogged stage looking for all the world like the undead Nazi cadaver of Robert E Lee, surveys a crowd noticeably diminished from Mary J Blige’s set, slurs “we are Modderead and we’re ’ere to play rock’n’rooowll” and sets about tearing the Pyramid stage a new hypotenuse.</p> \n<p>Despite Lemmy’s increasing resemblance to Iron Maiden’s mascot Eddie, Mot&ouml;rhead, of course, were never anything as crass as head-on metal. They’re filthy, gnarled pub punk rock’n’rollers on a 40-year diet of bad amphetamine and worse whiskeys, and the ride has taken its toll. At 69, Lemmy is a slurring, gargling rock wreck, a shrunken Biker General of the Damned, and the band’s formula, unrepentantly, shows little sign of evolution. </p> \n<p>From totemic opener Mot&ouml;rhead – an eternal band promise to “shoot you full of noise” from a band “born to kick your ass” – through Metropolis, Over The Top and Dr Rock, complete with a Terminator-worthy drum solo from Mikkey Dee, they play greasy full-throttle roadhog punk rock with occasional swerves into “nice slow blues” on Lost Woman Blues. </p> \n<p>It’s predictable but effective; Ace Of Spades has a field of Florence’s flower children pogoing gamefully along and Florence herself peering out as if deciding how metal to pitch her set. Glastonbury certainly prefers its hard rock unthreatening – why harsh a 45-year mellow? – but a mild mid-afternoon mosh is no longer out of the question.</p>","section":"Music","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/587c765e4dbd4a3a2712e2d0c46cf434dfa0f408/0_158_3000_1801/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1801,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Samir Hussein/Redferns via Getty Images","altText":"GLASTONBURY, ENGLAND - JUNE 26:  Phil Campbell and Lemmy Kilmister (R) of Motorhead perform at the Glastonbury Festival at Worthy Farm, Pilton on June 26, 2015 in Glastonbury, England.

While the Met Office forecasts the sun will return on Saturday, Sunday is set to be a bleak combination of cloud and more heavy rain.</p> \n<p>The first of the festival’s surprise acts this year was The Charlatans, who kicked things off on the Other stage. However, one of the quirkier additions to this year’s line-up was forced to pull out on Friday.
