As we drove through the village of Edington for the third time, past the impressive 14th-century church – again – I was starting to feel mild panic that the reverse would happen: we would never arrive at the Three Daggers. Wiltshire, with its ancient stones and its crop circles, is known for mysteries, but this was getting ridiculous. We found it on our fourth tour of the village – as three locals told us, you can’t miss it.</p> \n<p>The Three Daggers is a 200-year-old village inn that had been set for conversion into residential use. But Chad Pike, an American property developer and owner of nearby Priory Farm, bought it and revitalised the tired interior with all the classic markers of the modern pub: slate floor, zinc bar, wood-burners, old black and white photos. That was in 2010. Two years later, three guestrooms, a microbrewery and a farm shop were added, and there are plans for more rooms across the road. The latest addition is the “beer bus”, a jazzed-up Citroen H van that will tour festivals selling Daggers ales. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"769d97da8434f31bbc4a59373b75e6478f099746\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434642052372/cf5da6ff-5dec-4c58-bf60-8f57932de69c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Three Daggers, Wiltshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 200-year-old pub was redeveloped by the American owner of a nearby farm</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After my visit I came across a scathing report in the Daily Mail accusing Pike of turning the village into an olde England theme park for his rich American pals. But I find it very hard to believe that the village is ever overrun with Yanks squawking over the quaint cottages. In fact, what I liked most about the Daggers was the atmosphere: there was a genuine sense of conviviality in the bar, which was full of locals, including half the Erlestoke and Coulston cricket club, celebrating a win by ordering four-litre jugs of cider.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the cricket players had got over the novelty of drinking the pub’s own beer. In the pristine brewery next door, brewers Michael Andrews and Andrew King produce four ales of between 2.8% and 4.7% ABV, as well as stouts and some specials. At the bar, we tried samples of all four regulars while our five-year-old son eyed the glass jars of sweets. At dinner, eaten in the bright conservatory, my sea bass and my other half’s burger were good but the macaroni cheese from the kids’ menu was the standout dish.</p> \n<p>In fact, the pub proved a big hit all round for our son, who darted about the playground in the adjoining field while we sat in the pub garden. Above the pub, via a separate entrance, the three guestrooms share a living room with TV, board games and kitchen area stocked with cereals, juice and milk so we could feed him first thing, before breakfast was served downstairs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abad2e1bb1a4c2f12c270f0ce5d24f87dd9dc5e4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434641909769/28f654d6-ef4d-483e-8d41-29ed8ea39fa3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Village cricketers celebrate a victory at The Three Daggers’ beer bus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Village cricketers celebrate a victory at The Three Daggers’ beer bus</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The decor in the living room and bedrooms is pared back and subtly stylish, with natural carpet, white walls, canvas prints of local landscapes and cream brick tiles in the bathrooms. A spare child’s bed had been made up, although the huge double bed was easily big enough for the three of us.</p> \n<p>After breakfast, I spent a good half-hour nosing around the excellent farm shop, stocking up on bottles of ale, but resisting the temptation to invest in a two-litre flagon. By the time I’d paid, the team were busy setting up for a barbecue and we were in danger of going from eggs and bacon to burgers in less than an hour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebf391ab53d8798665ff0ad486b7707bf5ecf591\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434642339435/85604ebe-d5c8-49fa-9324-e93ee8dcedb1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hearty fare at The Three Daggers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Three Daggers’ restaurant</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We hopped in the car and drove 10 minutes to Salisbury Plain for a blustery walk around Bratton Camp iron age hill fort and its white horse – now concreted over to preserve it – as paragliders swooped in the sky above.

Its two sides, Buda and Pest, were separate cities until 1873, and they retain their own distinct identities, the former run through with ancient history, the latter noisier, earthier and more cosmopolitan. In Buda you’ll find royal palaces, Ottoman-era spas and wooded hills, while over in Pest you can pore over a clutch of fine museums, fantastic art nouveau buildings and a resurgent Jewish quarter.</p> \n<p>At any time of year, Budapest has myriad charms, but nothing beats gazing out across the broad sweep of the Danube from the Castle District on a sultry summer’s evening. It is at this time, too, that open-air bars and pavement cafes do roaring trade, and restaurants go alfresco – indeed, Budapest’s gastronomic renaissance is one of the most exciting developments to hit the city in recent times.

It’s a lovely slice of communist-era nostalgia, and heritage trains sometimes run. <br /><strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Memento Park </strong><br />For the full-on communist-era experience, the <strong>Memento Park</strong> (also known as Statue Park) has an assemblage of oversized statues and memorials that once stood in prominent public spaces throughout the city, but which were shunted out here following the collapse of the Iron Curtain. Visitors can wander among various apparatchiks, see giant statues of Stalin and Lenin and watch a secret agent training video. They can then hop inside a Trabant 601 car, that most iconic of Eastern Bloc symbols. <br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> O<em>pen daily 10am until dusk, corner of Balatoni &uacute;t and Szabadkai utca, +36 1 424 7500, </em><a href=\"http://www.mementopark.hu/\"><em>mementopark.hu</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Southeast Asian Gold Museum </strong><br />Budapest is full of terrific museums, but this little-known gem close to V&aacute;rosliget park is dazzling.

There is also a collection of naughty-looking linga, phallic-like symbols hewn from stone or rock crystal – they’re guaranteed to raise a smile.

Like breakfast cereal.” He moves on to other, darker malts around the room, used in traditional bitters and stouts.</p> \n<p>“I wouldn’t taste that,” he says, gesturing at some roasted barley, “but you’re welcome to smell it. It’s more smoky and astringent.”</p> \n<p>Stupidly, I have a nibble. He is right. It’s awful, like chewing coffee beans. Clearly, Gwynne knows his stuff. Which is good as, with his guidance, I am about to design my own ale.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/mar/01/10-best-cool-new-hotels-wales\">10 of the best cool new hotels in Wales</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a light industrial unit in Llysfaen, close to the north Wales coast, Conwy Brewery produces 36,000 pints a week, which it sells all over Wales and northern England. Local drinkers in particular lap up its elegant ales, alongside beers from the nearby breweries Nant, Great Orme and, over in Snowdonia, Purple Moose. Indeed, such is the thirst for good beer around here that in a novel collaboration, these four breweries jointly manage Conwy’s Albion Ale House and have opened two new pubs, Conwy’s Bridge Inn and Porthmadog’s Australia. Collectively, they are pioneering a mini-boom in north Wales beer.</p> \n<p>Conwy Brewery’s design-your-own-beer day (&pound;350 for up to eight) and brewer experience days (&pound;95pp, 01492 514 305, <a href=\"http://www.conbrew.moonfruit.com/home/4583038338\">conwybrewery.co.uk</a>) allow visitors to get involved in that production process. Budding brewers are expected to help dig out spent brewing malt from the mash tun. “It’s physical work,” warns Gwynne.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5aac641303110feb3e2bc41a385225c8ed6bf9e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639246490/8ec00bc2-9432-4cc5-b548-35ff1a2ff576-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Design-your-own-beer day at Conwy Brewery\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Design-your-own-beer day at Conwy Brewery</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Design-your-own-beer days are less arduous, handy as I am squeezing it all into a morning. After an introduction to mashing (where the malt is steeped in hot water) and the resulting wort (beer’s sugary base liquid), I find myself, at 11am, drinking a Clogwyn Gold, while Gwynne explains how hops determine a beer’s flavour. I like the upfront flavours of modern craft beers and so I go for a fruity, zesty combination of US-style Galaxy, Summit and Cascade hops. Gwynne is more of a traditionalist, but he will happily help guests brew any style: Belgian triple, saison, smoked porter. He promises to dry-hop mine, late on, to boost its flavour.</p> \n<p>Recipe calculated, hops weighed and the wort now boiling away, we chuck the initial load in. “The first mash stage is akin to coffee because you’re drawing from the grain,” says Gwynne. “This hop bit is akin to tea.”</p> \n<p>Normally, after further additions of hops as the boil progresses, the brewery lays on lunch for guests. Then, in the afternoon, they help cool the beer and strain it into the fermenter, using muslin to separate the trub (hop debris). Brewing being science as much as it is art, guest brewers also have to check the health of the yeast under a microscope, before pitching it into the wort to convert all that sugar into alcohol, carbon dioxide and delicious flavour compounds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82c1c909fb3499c87e59eb2f30d078fa73a723da\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639356293/474daf09-12c3-4394-bd64-e7b8d6d01e34-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"Castle Hotel restaurant\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Castle Hotel restaurant</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/jan/27/great-country-walks-moel-wnion-aber-falls-gwynedd-wales\">Great country walks: take the North Wales Path to Aber Falls, Gwynedd</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Gwynne and I have a prior lunch date and so – entrusting my brew to the loving care of the lads in the brewery – we head into Conwy. The Castle Hotel is best-known for chef Andrew Nelson’s modern British cooking, though the slick bedrooms (from &pound;135) are top-notch, too.</p> \n<p>Over impressive plates of pork belly, braised shin beef and pints of Dawson’s Dark (which Conwy brews for the hotel, pint from &pound;3.30), Gwynne explains how he has ended up running pubs with three other breweries: basically, it is a simple way to sell beer. They are rivals but, at microbrewery level, rivalry is usually very friendly, and they had already collaborated successfully on the beer tent element of the October Conwy Feast food festival. “Brewers tend to be enthusiastic about the whole industry, so they talk to one another a lot. Maybe it’s just that love of beer and pubs. It’s a naturally social industry.”</p> \n<p>Lunch done, we walk up the high street to the Albion, rather than down to the more family-orientated Bridge Inn on Rose Hill Street near Conwy’s famous castle. But first, we stop in wine and craft beer shop <a href=\"http://vinomondo.co.uk/\">Vinomondo</a> at no 19: the owners have just launched <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BankofConwy\">Bank of Conwy</a>, a tapas bar and restaurant on Lancaster Square showcasing cutting-edge craft beers. It has 20 draught taps (from &pound;3.50 a pint).</p> \n<p>In contrast, the <a href=\"http://albionalehouse.weebly.com/\">Albion</a> (from &pound;3.10 a pint), on Uppergate Street is a stripped-back 1920s corner pub for purists. There is no TV, no jukebox. “We let conversation reign,” says Great Orme Brewery’s owner, Jonathan Hughes. Naturally, the bar features beers from all four owners, but, in a further example of beery solidarity, also guest ales from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BigHandBrewing\">Big Hand</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cwrwial.com/\">Cwrw I&acirc;l </a>and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Heavy-Industry-Brewing/165142926970911\">Heavy Industry</a>. “Bringing in other local brewers,” says Jonathan, “only makes the Albion stronger.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33be003fd8c2711e9ec1e8f2c921220a556fee51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434642676612/7f9b326d-10da-4aca-b518-19b2799a9451-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hop-cured salmon, crispy pickled shallot rings and lemon cream cheese at The Kitchen Project\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hop-cured salmon, crispy pickled shallot rings and lemon cream cheese at The Kitchen Project</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2014/sep/25/top-10-hotels-b-and-bs-inns-in-wales-for-walkers\">Top 10 hotels, B&amp;Bs and hostels in Wales for walkers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Heavy Industry, known for its award-winning Pigeon-Toed Orange Peel Hefeweizen, is the radical on the scene. “I don’t care about tradition – I’m interested in big, flavourful beers,” says owner Tom McNeil. But he adds: “I don’t see it as new guard against old guard. They’ve got their market, we’ve got ours, and the Albion’s a great supporter of ours.”</p> \n<p>Heavy Industry curates the beers at the 13th-century, thatched <a href=\"http://llindir.co.uk/\">Llindir Inn</a> in Henllan, but I head to Great Orme’s new warehouse brewery in Llandudno for dinner in its events space, at chef Stuart Russell’s <a href=\"http://www.thekitchenpopup.com/\">The Kitchen</a> project. Stuart will be in a new location by the time you read this – The Kitchen is a series of pop-up events – but seek him out. His use of beer ingredients with food – hop-cured salmon, gem lettuce with roasted barley dressing, Atlantis ale-soused mackerel – was very clever.</p> \n<p>“The thing about north Wales is the fantastic produce,” says Stuart. “We use beef from Conwy valley, pork from Anglesey.

There is no menu as such; it just serves fresh fish caught that day. My usual pick is sardines and prawns to start, followed by <em>dorada</em> (sea bream). It also usually has tuna, swordfish and sea bass – all grilled, so it’s healthy, and served with fresh tomato and onion salad and boiled potatoes.

hotels</strong></a></p>","byline":"Gemma Price","body":"<p>Take the scenic Pacific Coast highway through California and turn inland roughly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Paso Robles, 20 miles up state route 46, is in the heart of California’s Central Coast wine region. Paso, as locals know it, is in San Luis Obispo county, where the Salinas river runs out of the Santa Lucia mountains. The city of Paso Robles has a quaint downtown surrounded by 20 square miles of coastal mountain terrain.</p> \n<p>Although wine-making in the region dates back two centuries to when missionaries first began growing grapes, it’s only recently that the Paso Robles American Viticultural Area (AVA, a federally recognised wine classification) has become a region to watch. In the past decade the numbers of producers and acres under vine have doubled, and now the Paso Robles AVA is the fastest-growing wine region in the US, with over 200 boutique and family-owned wineries producing zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon and other varietals from Spain, Italy, Bordeaux and the Rhone.</p> \n<p>The terrain offers plenty for the eye: flat river valley floodplains give way to sweeping slopes dotted with homesteads, farms and wineries, with most vineyards sitting on rolling hillsides between 500 and 1,000 feet above sea level. One of Paso’s charms is its as-yet-undiscovered feel: on-property tasting rooms are cosy and nowhere near as packed as those in Napa valley, and are more often than not manned by the vintners themselves. And Paso’s charming historic downtown has great new places to eat and drink without the crowds – or the higher price point – of its more famous northern counterpart.</p> \n<h2><strong>WINEMAKERS TO VISIT</strong></h2> \n<h2>Bianchi</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eb876386e96e609b636a7eb530d4e1a70da1418\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434472899787/0d04312d-c83f-4762-9af2-d872c401f2dd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bianchi Wine, Paso Robles, California\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In September 2014, Bianchi’s zinfandel beat stiff competition to be crowned California Zinfandel Champion.

Known for estate-grown and hand-crafted wines, the Bianchi family’s wine producing heritage dates from 1974, when Joseph Bianchi and his son Glenn set up shop on the banks of the San Joaquin river, eight miles from downtown Paso. Winemaker Tom Lane attributes the brand’s recent success to the 2011 zinfandel’s subtle layers, something he strives to achieve in every vintage through experimentation with fruit from different vineyards, changing harvest times, new yeast strains, and fermentation and aging regimes in spicy barrel types. A glass-walled tasting room overlooks flat fields of vines that begin to sweep upwards to the rear of the property and, inside, a fireplace and warm earth tones create a welcoming setting for winter tastings.

Forget standing in a crowded bar trying to avoid being stabbed in the eye by a tourist wielding a cocktail stick loaded with chorizo: it’s time for a proper meal, with chairs, and tables. But restaurants in a place such as Barcelona can empty your wallet quickly; the answer is a men&uacute; del d&iacute;a, the ubiquitous set lunch. The best offer good value and quality and they’ll see you through to the evening and back on the tapas trail.</p> \n<p><strong>All men&uacute;s here include three courses, a drink and bread unless stated</strong></p> \n<h2>La Polpa, Eixample</h2> \n<p>A wander up Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia is pretty much a must-do, whether you’re gawping at Gaud&iacute; buildings or heading for the shops. But the Eixample is proper moneyed Barcelona. The shops, the people, and the restaurants are expensive. That’s why La Polpa, a couple of blocks off the Passeig, is such a find. It’s got linen napkins, smartly dressed staff and a patina of posh, but the men&uacute; is still only €10.30. That really is astonishingly good value for this part of town. The food is modern and expertly turned out. A standout was an exceptionally tasty loin of tuna in teriyaki sauce. Even the house wine, a muscat, was a cut above the usual men&uacute; offerings.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€10.30 for the men&uacute;.

It’s a lovely quiet space and there’s a little open-air restaurant, El Jardi, which puts out great food from its tiny kitchen. It’s not fancy stuff but delicious. I had a thick leek and potato soup packed with flavour and a hearty lentil and sausage casserole.

There’s no escape – time to go old school at the “House of Spoons”. It claims to be the oldest restaurant in Barcelona and the men&uacute; doesn’t feel like it has changed in a couple of hundred years. It’s always packed with Spanish families, gossiping <em>abuelas</em> and tourists. And they all look like they are having a very good time. Individual dishes are such good value (goose with apples is lovely, filling and only €9.50) that they almost make the €17.50 men&uacute; look expensive, but three courses give plenty of time to enjoy the atmosphere. The fish soup is not too heavy, which was a good job because I followed it with pig’s trotter cooked in cava and the inevitable <em>crema catalana</em>.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€17.50 for the men&uacute;.</em> <em>Carrer d’en Quintana 5, +34 933 173 022, </em><a href=\"http://www.culleretes.com/en/home\"><em>culleretes.com</em></a><em>.

The only good one I knew was <a href=\"http://www.suquetdelalmirall.com/\">Suquet de l’Almirall</a>, but it’s expensive. Thankfully, a friend introduced me to La Mar Salada a few doors along. Take a table in the sunlit white interior or sit outside and people-watch. I had cream of artichoke soup, topped with a poached egg, my friend spinach and mushroom cannelloni in almond sauce. Then we had langoustines saut&eacute;ed with vegetables and served in a lime sauce and confit of duck with oranges and turnips. Desserts – carrot cake with Greek yoghurt, and white chocolate cake with a strawberry centre, were absolutely wonderful.

Gr&agrave;cia was a village until the city gobbled it up in the 19th century but the barrio retains a sense of community. La Singular fits in perfectly: it only has 10 tables and is a cosy locals’ favourite. It’s been going for years but still feels fresh and innovative. The food is classic Catalan with a bit of a twist. The €10 men&uacute; lists, for example, a salad of baby lettuce hearts in anchovy sauce, veal with endives, red peppers and brie, and mousse of <em>mat&oacute;</em> (a Catalan soft white cheese) with a fruit coulis.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€10 for the men&uacute;.

Little old ladies wander around with little dogs in their handbags and people greet each other on the street. It’s one of the city’s most desirable districts and there are lots of great, but expensive, places to eat. I wanted to recommend <a href=\"http://www.vivanda.cat/?lang=en\">Vivanda</a> on Carrer Major de Sarri&agrave; but it doesn’t have a men&uacute; to make it affordable, and <a href=\"http://tram-tram.com/cat/home.php\">Tram-Tram</a>, also on Carrer Major de Sarri&agrave;, has just put its men&uacute; up to €28. Never mind, El Clandestino in the heart of the barrio is very good and very sensibly priced. Unusually, there are half a dozen choices for each course. Nothing too fancy, but very well done – I’ll be trying to cook their beans with clams at home. Butt cheek of cow was delicious – and sounds better in Spanish. And if you’re still hungry and ready to get back to tapas, Barcelona’s best patatas bravas are served just round the corner at Bar Tom&aacute;s (Carrer Major de Sarri&agrave;, 49).<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€11.80 for the men&uacute;.
