Like breakfast cereal.” He moves on to other, darker malts around the room, used in traditional bitters and stouts.</p> \n<p>“I wouldn’t taste that,” he says, gesturing at some roasted barley, “but you’re welcome to smell it. It’s more smoky and astringent.”</p> \n<p>Stupidly, I have a nibble. He is right. It’s awful, like chewing coffee beans. Clearly, Gwynne knows his stuff. Which is good as, with his guidance, I am about to design my own ale.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/mar/01/10-best-cool-new-hotels-wales\">10 of the best cool new hotels in Wales</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In a light industrial unit in Llysfaen, close to the north Wales coast, Conwy Brewery produces 36,000 pints a week, which it sells all over Wales and northern England. Local drinkers in particular lap up its elegant ales, alongside beers from the nearby breweries Nant, Great Orme and, over in Snowdonia, Purple Moose. Indeed, such is the thirst for good beer around here that in a novel collaboration, these four breweries jointly manage Conwy’s Albion Ale House and have opened two new pubs, Conwy’s Bridge Inn and Porthmadog’s Australia. Collectively, they are pioneering a mini-boom in north Wales beer.</p> \n<p>Conwy Brewery’s design-your-own-beer day (&pound;350 for up to eight) and brewer experience days (&pound;95pp, 01492 514 305, <a href=\"http://www.conbrew.moonfruit.com/home/4583038338\">conwybrewery.co.uk</a>) allow visitors to get involved in that production process. Budding brewers are expected to help dig out spent brewing malt from the mash tun. “It’s physical work,” warns Gwynne.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5aac641303110feb3e2bc41a385225c8ed6bf9e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639246490/8ec00bc2-9432-4cc5-b548-35ff1a2ff576-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Design-your-own-beer day at Conwy Brewery\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Design-your-own-beer day at Conwy Brewery</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Design-your-own-beer days are less arduous, handy as I am squeezing it all into a morning. After an introduction to mashing (where the malt is steeped in hot water) and the resulting wort (beer’s sugary base liquid), I find myself, at 11am, drinking a Clogwyn Gold, while Gwynne explains how hops determine a beer’s flavour. I like the upfront flavours of modern craft beers and so I go for a fruity, zesty combination of US-style Galaxy, Summit and Cascade hops. Gwynne is more of a traditionalist, but he will happily help guests brew any style: Belgian triple, saison, smoked porter. He promises to dry-hop mine, late on, to boost its flavour.</p> \n<p>Recipe calculated, hops weighed and the wort now boiling away, we chuck the initial load in. “The first mash stage is akin to coffee because you’re drawing from the grain,” says Gwynne. “This hop bit is akin to tea.”</p> \n<p>Normally, after further additions of hops as the boil progresses, the brewery lays on lunch for guests. Then, in the afternoon, they help cool the beer and strain it into the fermenter, using muslin to separate the trub (hop debris). Brewing being science as much as it is art, guest brewers also have to check the health of the yeast under a microscope, before pitching it into the wort to convert all that sugar into alcohol, carbon dioxide and delicious flavour compounds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82c1c909fb3499c87e59eb2f30d078fa73a723da\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639356293/474daf09-12c3-4394-bd64-e7b8d6d01e34-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"Castle Hotel restaurant\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Castle Hotel restaurant</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/jan/27/great-country-walks-moel-wnion-aber-falls-gwynedd-wales\">Great country walks: take the North Wales Path to Aber Falls, Gwynedd</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Gwynne and I have a prior lunch date and so – entrusting my brew to the loving care of the lads in the brewery – we head into Conwy. The Castle Hotel is best-known for chef Andrew Nelson’s modern British cooking, though the slick bedrooms (from &pound;135) are top-notch, too.</p> \n<p>Over impressive plates of pork belly, braised shin beef and pints of Dawson’s Dark (which Conwy brews for the hotel, pint from &pound;3.30), Gwynne explains how he has ended up running pubs with three other breweries: basically, it is a simple way to sell beer. They are rivals but, at microbrewery level, rivalry is usually very friendly, and they had already collaborated successfully on the beer tent element of the October Conwy Feast food festival. “Brewers tend to be enthusiastic about the whole industry, so they talk to one another a lot. Maybe it’s just that love of beer and pubs. It’s a naturally social industry.”</p> \n<p>Lunch done, we walk up the high street to the Albion, rather than down to the more family-orientated Bridge Inn on Rose Hill Street near Conwy’s famous castle. But first, we stop in wine and craft beer shop <a href=\"http://vinomondo.co.uk/\">Vinomondo</a> at no 19: the owners have just launched <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BankofConwy\">Bank of Conwy</a>, a tapas bar and restaurant on Lancaster Square showcasing cutting-edge craft beers. It has 20 draught taps (from &pound;3.50 a pint).</p> \n<p>In contrast, the <a href=\"http://albionalehouse.weebly.com/\">Albion</a> (from &pound;3.10 a pint), on Uppergate Street is a stripped-back 1920s corner pub for purists. There is no TV, no jukebox. “We let conversation reign,” says Great Orme Brewery’s owner, Jonathan Hughes. Naturally, the bar features beers from all four owners, but, in a further example of beery solidarity, also guest ales from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BigHandBrewing\">Big Hand</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cwrwial.com/\">Cwrw I&acirc;l </a>and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Heavy-Industry-Brewing/165142926970911\">Heavy Industry</a>. “Bringing in other local brewers,” says Jonathan, “only makes the Albion stronger.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33be003fd8c2711e9ec1e8f2c921220a556fee51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434642676612/7f9b326d-10da-4aca-b518-19b2799a9451-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hop-cured salmon, crispy pickled shallot rings and lemon cream cheese at The Kitchen Project\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hop-cured salmon, crispy pickled shallot rings and lemon cream cheese at The Kitchen Project</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2014/sep/25/top-10-hotels-b-and-bs-inns-in-wales-for-walkers\">Top 10 hotels, B&amp;Bs and hostels in Wales for walkers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Heavy Industry, known for its award-winning Pigeon-Toed Orange Peel Hefeweizen, is the radical on the scene. “I don’t care about tradition – I’m interested in big, flavourful beers,” says owner Tom McNeil. But he adds: “I don’t see it as new guard against old guard. They’ve got their market, we’ve got ours, and the Albion’s a great supporter of ours.”</p> \n<p>Heavy Industry curates the beers at the 13th-century, thatched <a href=\"http://llindir.co.uk/\">Llindir Inn</a> in Henllan, but I head to Great Orme’s new warehouse brewery in Llandudno for dinner in its events space, at chef Stuart Russell’s <a href=\"http://www.thekitchenpopup.com/\">The Kitchen</a> project. Stuart will be in a new location by the time you read this – The Kitchen is a series of pop-up events – but seek him out. His use of beer ingredients with food – hop-cured salmon, gem lettuce with roasted barley dressing, Atlantis ale-soused mackerel – was very clever.</p> \n<p>“The thing about north Wales is the fantastic produce,” says Stuart. “We use beef from Conwy valley, pork from Anglesey. There are the ingredients to do something very good here.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8340b2bde345dd94ac9ba7ee1a922136c31f3130\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639482735/75935088-5739-41e8-bde6-d962479dd524-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Tony's beer, named Bitter?

hotels</strong></a></p>","byline":"Gemma Price","body":"<p>Take the scenic Pacific Coast highway through California and turn inland roughly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Paso Robles, 20 miles up state route 46, is in the heart of California’s Central Coast wine region. Paso, as locals know it, is in San Luis Obispo county, where the Salinas river runs out of the Santa Lucia mountains. The city of Paso Robles has a quaint downtown surrounded by 20 square miles of coastal mountain terrain.</p> \n<p>Although wine-making in the region dates back two centuries to when missionaries first began growing grapes, it’s only recently that the Paso Robles American Viticultural Area (AVA, a federally recognised wine classification) has become a region to watch. In the past decade the numbers of producers and acres under vine have doubled, and now the Paso Robles AVA is the fastest-growing wine region in the US, with over 200 boutique and family-owned wineries producing zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon and other varietals from Spain, Italy, Bordeaux and the Rhone.</p> \n<p>The terrain offers plenty for the eye: flat river valley floodplains give way to sweeping slopes dotted with homesteads, farms and wineries, with most vineyards sitting on rolling hillsides between 500 and 1,000 feet above sea level. One of Paso’s charms is its as-yet-undiscovered feel: on-property tasting rooms are cosy and nowhere near as packed as those in Napa valley, and are more often than not manned by the vintners themselves. And Paso’s charming historic downtown has great new places to eat and drink without the crowds – or the higher price point – of its more famous northern counterpart.</p> \n<h2><strong>WINEMAKERS TO VISIT</strong></h2> \n<h2>Bianchi</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eb876386e96e609b636a7eb530d4e1a70da1418\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434472899787/0d04312d-c83f-4762-9af2-d872c401f2dd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bianchi Wine, Paso Robles, California\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In September 2014, Bianchi’s zinfandel beat stiff competition to be crowned California Zinfandel Champion. Of the 93 wines entered, only four won double gold; Bianchi’s was one, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/may/20/california-sonoma-valley-wine-route-top-10-guide\">the other three were from Sonoma</a>, a wine region neighbouring Napa. Known for estate-grown and hand-crafted wines, the Bianchi family’s wine producing heritage dates from 1974, when Joseph Bianchi and his son Glenn set up shop on the banks of the San Joaquin river, eight miles from downtown Paso. Winemaker Tom Lane attributes the brand’s recent success to the 2011 zinfandel’s subtle layers, something he strives to achieve in every vintage through experimentation with fruit from different vineyards, changing harvest times, new yeast strains, and fermentation and aging regimes in spicy barrel types. A glass-walled tasting room overlooks flat fields of vines that begin to sweep upwards to the rear of the property and, inside, a fireplace and warm earth tones create a welcoming setting for winter tastings. Outside, a patio borders a lake teeming with koi carp gliding beneath miniature sailboats.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>3380 Branch Road, Paso Robles, +1 805 226 9922, </em><a href=\"http://www.bianchiwine.com/\"><em>bianchiwine.com</em></a><em>.

Baldwin now has 25 vintages under his belt and Isosceles – a blend of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot – remains the winery’s flagship and best-seller. Its other labels are delicious, too, particularly the big bold reds made using old world methods, such as harvesting by hand and small barrel-ageing in French oak. Sixteen miles from downtown Paso, its tasting room and restaurant have panoramic views of vineyards that undulate with the rolling hills. There’s also a three-room inn, where stays (from $375 a night for two) include a complimentary tasting experience: choose from a “deconstruction” or vertical tasting of different vintages of Isosceles, or a library tasting hosted in the Chateau, Justin Baldwin’s former home.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>11680 Chimney Rock Road, Paso Robles, +1 805 238 6932, </em><a href=\"http://justinwine.com/\"><em>justinwine.com</em></a><em>.

Every wine in their portfolio is estate-grown over 200 acres of vineyards – half are east of Paso Robles and the other half are at the Templeton Gap winery – but only a small proportion of the grapes they grow become Red Soles wine; the rest are sold to large wineries.

Forget standing in a crowded bar trying to avoid being stabbed in the eye by a tourist wielding a cocktail stick loaded with chorizo: it’s time for a proper meal, with chairs, and tables. But restaurants in a place such as Barcelona can empty your wallet quickly; the answer is a men&uacute; del d&iacute;a, the ubiquitous set lunch. The best offer good value and quality and they’ll see you through to the evening and back on the tapas trail.</p> \n<p><strong>All men&uacute;s here include three courses, a drink and bread unless stated</strong></p> \n<h2>La Polpa, Eixample</h2> \n<p>A wander up Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia is pretty much a must-do, whether you’re gawping at Gaud&iacute; buildings or heading for the shops. But the Eixample is proper moneyed Barcelona. The shops, the people, and the restaurants are expensive. That’s why La Polpa, a couple of blocks off the Passeig, is such a find. It’s got linen napkins, smartly dressed staff and a patina of posh, but the men&uacute; is still only €10.30. That really is astonishingly good value for this part of town. The food is modern and expertly turned out. A standout was an exceptionally tasty loin of tuna in teriyaki sauce. Even the house wine, a muscat, was a cut above the usual men&uacute; offerings.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€10.30 for the men&uacute;.

It’s a lovely quiet space and there’s a little open-air restaurant, El Jardi, which puts out great food from its tiny kitchen. It’s not fancy stuff but delicious. I had a thick leek and potato soup packed with flavour and a hearty lentil and sausage casserole.

It claims to be the oldest restaurant in Barcelona and the men&uacute; doesn’t feel like it has changed in a couple of hundred years. It’s always packed with Spanish families, gossiping <em>abuelas</em> and tourists. And they all look like they are having a very good time. Individual dishes are such good value (goose with apples is lovely, filling and only €9.50) that they almost make the €17.50 men&uacute; look expensive, but three courses give plenty of time to enjoy the atmosphere.

Given its climate and location, Iceland imports most of its fruit and vegetables. But at Fridheimar farm, near the town of Selfoss, 30 miles from Reykjavik, a large greenhouse produces 300 tonnes of them a year. Big, red, implausibly juicy specimens are harvested there every single day, despite the long, dark winters. Its farm cafe makes a great place to stop for a bloody mary with a brilliant tomato tang, or a perfect bowl of tomato soup.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a833dc4b2bf425f6b0e2d4ee0e0fb016a1d90c55\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113342848/eb9e6bb0-6fc5-4336-b4f5-caedad707ed7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside a greenhouse at Fridheimar, where geothermal energy is used to grow fruit and vegetables.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside a greenhouse at Fridheimar, where geothermal energy is used to grow fruit and vegetables.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arctic-Images/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/apr/30/top-10-hotels-in-reykjavik\">Top 10 hotels in Reykjavik</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The farm’s Arctic location actually works in its favour: there are fewer pests here, and warm ocean currents keep the climate deceptively warm. Also, Iceland’s geothermal energy creates enough electricity to heat and light the plants all year round. A volcanic growing medium is used in place of soil and 600 bumble bees imported from Holland take care of pollination.</p> \n<p>It’s a major operation: the farm uses 1.2 megawatts of electric power, the equivalent of the domestic use of a town of 3,000 people. Computers control heat, humidity, CO2, lighting, and watering, while weather stations on the rooftops monitor wind speed and direction and sunlight.</p> \n<p>As well as the cafe, there are talks and exhibitions, riding demonstrations and a foodie souvenir shop. The bloody mary recipe is a secret, says Kn&uacute;tur Rafn &Aacute;rmann, who runs the farm with his wife Helena and their five children.

If you know there are foods you love that are easy to get to, why wouldn’t you have a go at &shy;collecting them? I can’t think of anything nicer than eating food you’ve caught yourself. <br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/foraging\">Foraging</a> is great for all ages and you don’t need much kit to get started. A good knife helps and a bag to store your goods in. Start by taking a walk along the coastline. If you’re armed with a pocket book to identify species, you’ll find the experience so much more satisfying. <br /></p> \n<p>Rock pools are great for finding the odd largish crab or little fish, but I always find that if you walk along the rocks, you’ll find a bit of sea spinach growing, or some samphire. It’s best to go <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/foraging\">foraging</a> on an outgoing tide so everything is fresh and wet. <br /></p> \n<p>Avoid anywhere built-up or near harbours and marinas because of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/pollution\">pollution</a>. Don’t pick up anything if you don’t know what it is or anything dead. <br /></p> \n<p>One of my favourite catches is prawns. Last summer, my &shy;neighbour called me over – we have a little &shy;pontoon outside the front of our house in Brixham, Devon. He’d caught about 150 prawns and we sat on our steps and boiled them. We had a bottle of wine, looking out to sea, and wolfed them down in 20 minutes. Perfect.<strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Sea beets (also known as sea spinach)</strong><br />You can find these on rocky shores. Boil them in a pan over a fire – they’re a bit like tough leeks – and naturally salty. A spoonful or two of ricotta is a delicious addition, along with a bit of olive oil or butter, and plenty of black pepper. Available all year round but best between April and July.</p> \n<p><strong>Clams and mussels</strong><br />Wait until low tide when it should be easier to spot clam beds; rake along the shoreline and wait for them to come to the top. Boil them in a pan over your camp fire and add a couple of dashes of sherry, then throw in some finely chopped onion, coriander and a bay leaf.</p> \n<p><strong>Samphire</strong><br />Look out for samphire on muddy flats around estuaries or tidal creeks. You can eat the young types now. Laver seaweed, the basis of Welsh laver bread, is another easy find. Boil it down then add a bit of seasoning, use olive oil and lemon juice.</p> \n<p><strong>Crabs</strong><br />You can either hunt in rockpools or use a crabbing line – near a jetty is good. Boil in salted seawater over your beach fire for around 20 minutes. Smash them up and eat with crusty bread and mayonnaise, with your feet in the water.</p> \n<p><strong>Prawns</strong><br />Find a jetty where there’s seaweed hanging down, get yourself a little net and just lie on the pontoon, scooping all the way along the weeds. Just boil them in some seawater or salt water. Lemon juice, mayonnaise and bread optional.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Recipe for steamed clams over seaweed</strong><br />1. Dig a shallow hole a little smaller than the width of your grill. Line with stones and light a fire to make your beach barbecue.</p> \n<p>2. Put a little water in a pan and heat over your barbecue.</p> \n<p>3. Place a bunch of seaweed – bladderwrack (black in colour with pods) is one of the most plentiful – in the pan so it covers the water.</p> \n<p>4. Lay your clams over the seaweed, ideally with some wild fennel if <br />it’s handy. </p> \n<p>5. Season, cover with foil and let the clams steam for 8-10 minutes. (This is even tastier made with white fish but mackerel is good too if you can catch any.) Best served with crisp white wine and a spicy slaw.<em><br />Words by Rosie Ifould.

But amid its mountains, canyons and ancient villages are superb hiking trails, delicious local fare and top places to stay</p>","byline":"Alexandra Topping","body":"<p>As I wound my way up a wildflower-strewn path along Greece’s dizzying Vikos gorge, I had to keep stopping, just to drink in its sheer scale. Forested mountains stretched into the distance – the craggy peaks still topped with snow – and the clear waters of the Voidomatis river whooshed by below. I hadn’t seen another soul for hours. In a country so blessed with ancient ruins, islands and beaches, people tend to forget about Greece’s mountains as a holiday option.</p> \n<p>Unspoilt Vikos-Ao&ouml;s national park is in the Zagori region, near the Albanian border and an uncomplicated three-hour drive from Thessaloniki airport. As with everywhere in Greece, times are hard in this region, and businesses are keen to attract tourists. Prices have been slashed. We stayed at one of the more upmarket hotels in the region, <a href=\"http://www.aristi.eu/en?gclid=CKXalLGHhcYCFQkIwwodyJUAig\">Aristi Mountain Resort</a>, in the village of Aristi, where room rates now start at 15% less than before the crisis. A cluster of traditional stone buildings perched on a slope overlooking the valley, it has phenomenal views, chic interiors (natural materials, rich Ottoman rugs and fireplaces for winter nights) and a spa with indoor pool, steam room and sauna. Luxury for a little more than &pound;80 a night for two.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ab08428f30c412f53b90b185c777db8beaae361\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434109083718/0f2d4ebf-9e0d-4fd5-8375-efc88a338b28-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A lounge area at the Aristi Mountain Resort\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lounge area at the Aristi Mountain Resort</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The national park has smooth, empty roads, pristine hiking trails and traditional stone villages, many of which are home to good-value restaurants, B&amp;Bs and small hotels (from around €40 a night if you’re looking for a cheaper stay). Tourism has developed slowly and organically here, with strict regulation reining in excess and eyesores.</p> \n<p>My partner Adam and I spent the days hiking, or rafting down the Voidomatis, and the evenings on the hotel terrace, looking over the valley and watching the Astraka peaks turn pink and orange. Dinners included a €30 “tasting feast”, with foraged mushrooms, trout and smoked eel.</p> \n<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, the villages were prosperous staging posts for Ottoman traders, and the paths they travelled are now ideal for hiking: routes between villages range from under two hours to all-day treks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ba5029b3178d2ef79d51cda020bcd3d4ca0d853\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434109293899/9aaa65ce-f681-4b56-bb3b-21d6e5c89812-460x299.jpeg\" alt=\"The river Vikos near Vitsa.\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The river Vikos near Vitsa.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hellier/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Local company <a href=\"http://www.trekking.gr/sections/outdoor-holidays-in-greece\">Trekking Hellas</a> does guided or self-guided tours with rooms and meals. A six-day tour, exploring the area by bike, raft and on foot, including accommodation, meals and equipment, cost from €560pp. But we managed with a good map (the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Pindus-Zagori-anavasi-Mountains-Maps/dp/9608195233\">Pindus Topo 50 of the Zagori area</a>) and a book of walks from the information centre in Aspraggeli, a few kilometres south.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/jan/30/hossein-amini-athens-greece-the-way-i-see-it\">Filmmaker Hossein Amini on Athens</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The footpaths are well-marked, so you can simply float along, taking in the view and the herb-scented air. Our favourite took us down a valley from Vikos to the source of the Voidomatis, then steeply up to the pretty village of Mikro Papigo, in around four hours. The walks are not circular, but some hotels offer drop-offs and pick-ups, and guesthouses can put hikers in touch with local drivers.</p> \n<p>One day we checked out the elegant stone bridges built by those Ottoman traders from the 17th century onwards. Kokkoros, soaring between natural limestone pillars, and the three-humped Plakidas bridge near Kipi, were particularly memorable. We spent another day driving between villages. In Monodendri, we parked in the square and walked for 10 minutes to 15th-century Saint Paraskevi monastery, built into the side of a gorge, where saints stare down from carefully restored frescos.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c09d82e1cdcc940eb487431b1abab905b7e817f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434108969020/aca94441-70de-4272-857f-b6f85d499eaa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The three-arched Plakidas bridge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The three-arched Plakidas bridge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hercules Milas/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The smell of roasting lamb tempted us into family-run Sta Risa taverna in Elati, where we gorged on <em>gigantes</em> – huge beans with spinach and tomato – warm bread, lamb chops, hand-cut fries strewn with thyme, and slow-roast lamb.
