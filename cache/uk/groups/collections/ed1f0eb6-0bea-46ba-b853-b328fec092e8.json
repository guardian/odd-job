It is a legacy of <a href=\"http://www.ainu-museum.or.jp/en/study/eng01.html\">the Ainu</a>, the indigenous people often ignored by the rest of Japan, and originates in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2008/mar/29/japan.camping\">Hokkaido</a>, the country’s northernmost and mountainous island.</p> \n<p><em>Ruibe</em> is half-frozen sashimi, usually wild salmon, hauled from Hokkaido’s cold waters. The fish was traditionally frozen in the open air then overwintered under the snow, before being dug up to eat in spring …and the Ainu didn’t wait for it to thaw. It’s literally a melt-in-the-mouth dish.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/mar/10/best-restaurants-kyoto-tokyo-japan-chefs-choice\">The best restaurants in Tokyo and Kyoto – chosen by Japan’s top chefs</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Nowadays, chefs and home cooks choose salmon “as fat, handsome and fresh as possible”, then simply clean, fillet and freeze it in the freezer, explains chef Shinichi Maeda, who runs <a href=\"http://kiniseko.com/en/dining-ki-niseko\">An Dining at Ki Niseko</a> in Abuta-Gun, Hokkaido. The ruibe is then cut and eaten while still frozen, and served with soy sauce and fresh wasabi.</p> \n<p>“Ruibe’s unique point is its half-frozen texture,” says Yuichi Kamimura, another Hokkaido-born chef and owner of <a href=\"http://www.kamimura-niseko.com\">Kamimura restaurant</a>, also in Abuta-Gun. “It is somewhere between cubed ice and the silkiness of sorbet.”</p> \n<p>Not surprisingly, ruibe translates as “melted food”. Not generally expensive, ruibe can be found on the menus of some of Hokkaido’s <em>izakaya</em> – the casual, local restaurants ubiquitous throughout Japan. But rather like the Ainu and their culture, one has to look hard to find it. A few restaurants in Sapporo, Hokkaido’s largest city, list the local speciality on their menus: try <a href=\"http://suginome.jp/english/\">Suginome (suginome.jp)</a>, which has various branches, or <a href=\"http://www.hyousetsu.co.jp.e.em.hp.transer.com/\">Hyousetsu-no-mon (hyousetsu.co.jp)</a>.</p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436444074064/5776d915-144a-4802-ab00-75937e6cc85a-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Ruibe","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-12T06:00:03Z","lastModified":"2015-07-12T06:00:03Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":10,"contributors":[],"feature":true,"keywords":["Japan","Food and drink","Asia","Travel","Japanese food and drink","Fish","Food & drink","Seafood"],"tags":[{"id":"travel/japan","webTitle":"Japan"},{"id":"travel/travelfoodanddrink","webTitle":"Food and drink"},{"id":"travel/asia","webTitle":"Asia"},{"id":"travel/travel","webTitle":"Travel"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/japanese-food-and-drink","webTitle":"Japanese food and drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/fish","webTitle":"Fish"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/seafood","webTitle":"Seafood"}],"section":{"id":"travel"},"topics":[],"series":{"title":"The foodie traveller","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/travel/series/the-foodie-traveller"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"travel"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","quoteColour":"#fdadba","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/jul/12/ruibe-frozen-raw-fish-hokkaido-japan-foodie-traveller","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4afhv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/travel/2015/jul/12/ruibe-frozen-raw-fish-hokkaido-japan-foodie-traveller","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jul/12/ruibe-frozen-raw-fish-hokkaido-japan-foodie-traveller"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436444074064/5776d915-144a-4802-ab00-75937e6cc85a-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":" Cold fish … ruibe is is half-frozen sashimi, usually wild salmon, hauled from Hokkaido’s cold waters.

Of course, the collapse of the economy has brought hardship and deprivation here in Thessaloniki, as in the rest of Greece, but locals – from the 150,000-strong student population to the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/public-leaders-network/2014/dec/30/tattooed-mayor-thessaloniki-greece-yiannis-boutaris\">73-year-old mayor</a> – have refused to let it stop the city moving forward. And nowhere is this more evident than in its thriving gastronomic scene: Thessaloniki might be the country’s second city, but it is the gourmet capital.</p> \n<p>Located in the far north of the country, it has for over 2,000 years been a melting pot of cultures – reflected in the blend of spicy eastern, French, Balkan and Mediterranean flavours of its cuisine, and in its cosmopolitan vibe. are part of the culture, and while everyone has been forced to tighten their metaphorical belts, no one wants to tighten their real ones. So, gone are the days of meals in tavernas setting you back around €30 per head; in their place are good-value bars and cafes.</p> \n<p>Thessalonians were never going to let a financial crisis get in the way of a good time. Instead, they’ve seized the chance to breathe new life into the city. Here are the highlights.</p> \n<h2><strong>The Roman forum</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e3370f6c7bd81a4c11d723e88b59e8368ff4f37\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436542219077/3bce5be6-f769-4ea0-8272-f73318bed5ce-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Piece of Cake.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Piece of Cake.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The <em>agora</em> is undergoing excavations. The area is a typical Thessalonian mix of ancient and modern. Look down and you’ll see ancient columns and arches running the length of the agora; look up and you’re surrounded by tall office blocks and apartments leading to the Arch of Galeris and the Rotunda, which has the city’s only minaret. Once a Roman mausoleum, then a Christian church, and later a mosque, the Rotunda is the oldest monument in the city.</p> \n<p>Barely a week goes by without a new cafe, bar or restaurant popping up here. One of the newer arrivals is six-month-old <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kafeneio-Basta-Thessaloniki/287147344829369\"><strong>Basta</strong></a> (Mitropolitou Gennadiou 16). With its tiled floors, deep-red walls hung with black-and-white photos, and bistro-style chairs, it’s a modernised version of a traditional <em>kafeneio</em>, where retired men once eked out their days over backgammon and cigarettes. Linger over a coffee or <em>tsipouro</em> (the local grappa) for €3. More funky and colourful is the recently opened <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/%CE%9A%CE%BF%CF%85%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%AF-coffee-crafts/338814699633019\"><strong>Koubi</strong></a> (Peloponnisou 2), a coffee-crafting cafe, which teaches crocheting, jewellery making and other crafts (€10 a session). Alternatively, €4 buys a drink and a panini.</p> \n<p>Before the crisis, Dimitris Ekosidios restored classic cars; now he runs <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NterlikatesenOlaSoublaki\"><strong>Derlicatessan Souvlaki</strong></a> (Ioanni Kouskoura 7) – a play on the word <em>derli</em>, meaning to scoff – where he serves pork and chicken souvlaki, <em>dikavalo</em> (mushrooms and halloumi cheese) with chips, and feta pitta pockets from as little as €2.50. Diners here spill out onto the wooden tables on the pavement.</p> \n<p>Thessaloniki’s bakeries are famous for their <em>trigona panoramatos</em> (triangular pastries filled with cream) and <em>koulouria</em> (a regional, Sephardic, bagel-type bread), but new cafe on the block <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Piece-of-Cake/340197129339385\"><strong>Piece of Cake</strong></a> (Xrysostomou Smyrnis 19) serves “Greek spoon sweets” with its coffee – chunks of oranges stewed in syrup, made to the recipe of the young owner’s grandmother (€2). It’s a narrow cafe, with just enough room to pass between the marble counter and the circular tables opposite, but it’s welcoming, with bright cups used as vases for fresh flowers. Another new restaurant, and a first for Thessaloniki, is the vegetarian <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/rOOTS/1512775345602506?_rdr=p&amp;fref=ts\"><strong>Roots</strong></a> (Balanou 4-6, +30 231 026 8063) – veggie restaurants are few and far between in Greece – which serves dishes such as risotto, beetroot balls and <em>fava</em> (pureed chickpeas), inspired by Greek, Asian and Balkan cuisine.</p> \n<h2><strong>Ano Poli</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d893f4f04eb1672f90a646ef249feb34b604597\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436542267645/dee4cc6c-cdaa-4cc6-95bf-48adb29d0f23-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Toixo Toixo.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Toixo Toixo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picasa/PR</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This district (its name means “upper town”) is a maze of wooden houses and restaurants that have adapted their menus and dropped their prices to suit the times. <a href=\"https://el-gr.facebook.com/propyleon\"><strong>Propyleon Piano Bar</strong></a> (Eptapyrgiou 130, +30 231 020 2495) has outstanding views over the Byzantine domes of <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=st+paul+church+thessaloniki&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1041&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=7qibVe6oIcnU7AaB4IGQDg&amp;ved=0CDkQsAQ\">St Paul’s church</a> to the city and gulf beyond. Suck on a “submarine”, a hard vanilla sweet, served with a spoon in a glass of water, with Greek coffee. Or, in the evening, order a selection of meze – mackerel, sardines, slices of sausage and grilled cheeses (€8, including a drink) – and listen to live traditional and contemporary music. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/toixosalonica/info?_rdr=p&amp;tab=overview\"><strong>Toixo Toixo</strong> </a>(Polydorou Stergiou 1, +30 231 024 5351) is airy and bright, with sage woodwork, wooden tables and Greek rush seats, but it’s the view of the ancient city walls that makes it worth a visit, along with the food: try the <em>hilopites metsovou</em> (pasta made in the mountain village of Metsovo) or <em>sikotia sharas</em> (thick slices of chargrilled liver) with Macedonian red wine (from €15).</p> \n<p>Heading downhill, narrow streets open out into small squares and the courtyards of Byzantine chapels. Tsinari Square, named after the Turkish (cinar) for the plane tree which provides welcome shade here, is home to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ouzeri-Tsinari/161289803922336?sk=info&amp;tab=overview\"><strong>Ouzeri Tsinari</strong></a> (Alexandras Papadopoulou 72, +30 231 028 4028) where, for around €20, you can wash down grilled sardines, flash-fried shrimps with tomato and thyme, and <em>soutzoukakia</em> (meatballs with cumin) with enough ouzo to send you staggering back to the lower town.</p> \n<h2><strong>Valaoritou</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e47e00b097dfa2e7477674b4b0512a0fad57b53\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436542340609/43e7854e-756b-4dd4-ade3-7b12801b4e17-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Pizza Poselli.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pizza Poselli.</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the former Jewish quarter, this is one of the few areas that was not destroyed by the great <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Thessaloniki_Fire_of_1917\">fire of Thessaloniki in 1917</a>.

Named after the building’s Italian architect, who reflected the aspirations of the merchant class of the early 20th century in the building’s columns and balustrades, it is topped by a facade with a built-in clock that shows the exact time the city was struck by an earthquake in June 1978 – 11.05pm.</p> \n<p>Pizza Poselli dishes up generous slices of Greek-style pizza – wafer-thin crusts topped with fresh vegetables and local cheeses – with salad and beer, for around €3.</p> \n<p>This area bursts into life after 10pm, when Thessaloniki’s younger crowd begins to party.

Skopelos is larger but less visited than Skiathos. Its scenery is perhaps more beautiful and certainly less developed. Much more rugged Alonissos lies in the middle of a marine park, surrounded by a group of uninhabited satellite islands. Skyros is by far the least visited of the Sporades, at least by non-Greeks (there is a domestic airport).

They could easily fill a holiday on their own but, combined with Athens and the mainland, would make for a trip that summed up the very best of Greece.</p> \n<p>Having said that, and unless you’re keen to see the site where the Greeks defeated the Persian navy in 480 BC, Salamis is probably not worth the effort. Aegina (an hour by ferry from Athens) is a much better bet. The classical temple of Aphaea is everything you imagine a Greek temple to be and is far less visited than some.</p> \n<p>Heading south around the Peloponnese coast, the islands become more upmarket and expensive, and are best out of season. Poros, only a long stone’s throw from the mainland, attracts some package tourism but is beautiful, nonetheless, and a great base for exploring the famous sites on the mainland (the theatre of Epidaurus and Mycenae among them).</p> \n<p>Hydra ramps up the stakes, not even allowing cars or bicycles to spoil the island’s tranquillity. If you can afford it, its charms are obvious and have not gone unnoticed by the world’s artists, writers and musicians.</p> \n<p>Spetses, a little further on, is an outpost for the remaining rich Greeks and the yacht crowd. Away from them, the interior is almost entirely unpopulated and hiking will allow you to savour the mysterious atmosphere that inspired John Fowles’ The Magus. Lastly, Kythira is strictly part of the Ionian islands, but is most easily reached from the Peloponnese. If you can make it here, you will be rewarded with one of the most authentic and beautiful Greek islands there is.</p> \n<p><strong>Getting there and deals</strong><br />These islands are best approached by flying to Athens and then either driving into the Peloponnese and hopping over, or getting the ferry or hydrofoil from Piraeus. Kythira can be reached directly from here as well, but you are better off taking the chance to explore the Peloponnese and then get the ferry from Neapoli in the south (although you can fly from Athens).</p> \n<p>A <a href=\"http://www.responsibletravel.com/accommodation/873/holiday-retreat-in-greece-saronic-islands\">Greek-owned retreat on Agistri</a>, smallest of the Saonic islands, is available with Responsible Travel (doubles from &pound;38-&pound;82 a night, <a href=\"http://www.responsibletravel.com/\">responsibletravel.com</a>), with rooms spread out like a village.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, tour the Saronic islands on a Seamaster Yachting (<a href=\"http://www.seamaster.co.uk/pages/2015+Greece+yacht+charters\">seamaster.co.uk</a>) holiday, including skipper/instructor, and return flights from Gatwick to Athens, departing 1 August for &pound;865pp (based on six sharing).</p> \n<h2><strong>The Peloponnese</strong><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c879d174c614d4eac0ff3082df04a8613780dbe\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436526418606/1f29248a-7eda-4906-978d-12575d037f41-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"mystra\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It is easy to think that Greece is all about the islands. Apart from Athens, and a few of the major classical sites, the mainland is often ignored. This is a huge mistake. Mainland Greece has the same glorious weather, the same hospitable people and the same world-class beaches as the islands. It is also less crowded, has a variety of ancient sites, is strung with dramatic mountain ranges, and gives you a much more authentic view of Greece than most of the islands can ever manage.</p> \n<p>To really get to know these areas, hire a car and explore. The Peloponnese peninsula, connected to the rest of Greece by the original Isthmus, can almost be treated as the country’s biggest island (it’s the size of Wales). It is popular with tourists, but most don’t make it past the big archaeological sites. To be fair, these are a must-see and include Olympia, Ancient Corinth, Mycenae, Epidaurus theatre and Sparta.</p> \n<p>There are many less famous, but equally stunning, remnants of the past. Near Sparta, the remains of Mystra deserve a mention – the world’s best preserved Byzantine city is a treasure trove of architecture and frescos.</p> \n<p>The peninsula is also blessed by nature. Its mountains are crossed by hiking trails and, down on the plains, possibly the finest olives in the world grow. In springtime, especially down in the famously rugged Mani region, the bare hillsides are painted with a staggering profusion of wild flowers. Finally, the beaches are at least a match for anything the islands can offer.</p> \n<p><strong>Getting there and deals</strong><br />Scheduled flights run to Kalamata. A week’s package in Skafidia, west Peloponnese, costs from &pound;649pp including flights (from Gatwick, Birmingham or Manchester), transfers and all-inclusive accommodation at the five-star Aldemar Olympian Village for late July and August with Fleetway (<a href=\"http://www.fleetwaytravel.com/deals/luxury_holiday_collection_greece_kalamata_aldemar_olympian_village.php\">fleetwaytravel.com</a>).</p> \n<h2><strong>The North</strong><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5450e50914ff0f1e4e4e9c81dc695477d7bd3d12\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436526649203/ae546fb6-43b9-46d5-abcb-ca5d534ee2e8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Edessa\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The northern mainland only became part of Greece in the 20th century, and retains its own character, much influenced by the Balkans to the north and Turkey to the east. It is an intriguing area that rewards proper exploration. Most of the beach resorts are on the two western prongs of the Halkidiki peninsula. For more privacy, and stunning Byzantine architecture, head to mount Athos, a semi-independent “monk’s republic”. Just make sure you have your permit beforehand (and that you are male – not even female cats are allowed). The rest of this little-explored region includes intriguing possibilities, such as hiking up mount Olympus, seeing the tombs of Alexander the Great’s family at Vergina, the cliff-hugging wooden houses of Edessa, and the natural beauty of the Prespa lakes. This is a Greece that most ignore.</p> \n<p><strong>Getting there and deals</strong><br />Scheduled flights run to Thessaloniki. Koukouli Guesthouse (doubles from €40, <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=el&amp;u=http://www.koukouli.com/&amp;prev=search\">koukouli.com</a>) is a cosy hiking hideaway, surrounded by forest, near the Vikos canyon. Sivota, in mountainous Epirus, is near hills covered in pine, cypress and olive trees and has a pretty harbour looking across to Corfu. A trip there, departing from Manchester on 23 July, flying to Preveza airport and staying in the three-star Albatross Hotel now costs &pound;495pp (was &pound;632) through Olympic Holidays (<a href=\"http://www.olympicholidays.com/greece/sivota/sivota/albatros-hotel/\">olympicholidays.com</a>).</p> \n<p>For a different way to visit the Halkidiki peninsula, while also enjoying island life, stay on nearby Ammouliani, a 4.5 sq km isle fringed by a string of Caribbean-like sandy beaches with shallow waters. Departing 31 July, seven nights’ B&amp;B at the peaceful <a href=\"https://www.sunvil.co.uk/holidays/greece/halkidiki/ammouliani/accommodation?open=ismini-hotel\">Ismini Hotel</a>, with Sunvil (020 8758 4758, <a href=\"https://www.sunvil.co.uk\">sunvil.co.uk</a>) now costs &pound;589 pp (two sharing, was &pound;838pp) including flights from Gatwick and transfers.

It can be reached in a long day trip from Athens, so it can be crowded. Don’t be put off – the ancients decided that this spot was the centre of the world and it is heart-stoppingly beautiful. Stay in one of the nearby towns or villages (far nicer than the tourist town by the ruins), and visit the site early in the morning and late in the evening to enjoy it to its full. North from Delphi are many lesser-known, but equally beguiling, places. Meteora is a fairytale landscape of monasteries, perched on rock pinnacles. To the east is the increasingly popular Pelion; a wooded peninsula of fine walks and sheltered beaches where the centaurs used to play. Over the crags of the Pindus mountains lies the old Ottoman capital of Iannina beside its tranquil lake. Here the ferocious Ali Pasha played amiable host to a young Lord Byron. All of these can be visited from the beaches of Parga on the west coast.</p> \n<p><strong>Getting there and deals</strong><br />Fly to Athens and hire a car. Minelska Resorts (suites from €100, <a href=\"http://www.minelska.gr/index.php/en/\">minelska.gr</a>) on the Pelion is a richly decorated B&amp;B with views over the seafront at Kala Nera. Or Sunvil Holidays (020 8758 4758, sunvil.co.uk) has a week self-catering for &pound;609pp (down from &pound;716pp) departing 31 July from Gatwick, at the modern Melograno Apartments, also in Kala Nera.</p> \n<h2><strong>Athens</strong><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c1149a01a223ac7badff23b41443064b4640dca\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436526820827/6e57d03a-8c5f-4a8f-88a3-e43fffb0fb70-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Acropolis of Athens\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott E Barbour/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Athens is still a peaceful city; the bars and restaurants will appreciate visitors and all the sites are open as usual.

One of my favourite places is the 14th-century Byzantine Church of Saint Nicholas the Orphan, just inside the eastern wall. It has beautiful frescoes and an enormous sense of the past.

Besides, I reasoned, food is a major part of every culture – would I really be getting into the year-abroad mindset if I refused to try local, traditional foods?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/mortarboard/2013/jun/24/veganism-on-a-student-budget\">Veganism on a student budget</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> But for students with medical or religious reasons for restricted diets, or who are just less hypocritical than myself, flexibility isn’t an option. So how can you navigate a year abroad on a restricted diet?</p> \n<h2>Come prepared</h2> \n<p> Abigail Jones (not her real name) studies French and Italian at the University of Kent, and is allergic to nuts, as well as mosquito bites. She found preparation key for her time in Switzerland and Italy: “I keep a ready supply of the stuff I need in case I get bitten or eat something. Make sure you know exactly how to explain to waiters that you have an allergy, so you don’t accidentally order something that could make you ill.” </p> \n<p>Allergy UK offers <a href=\"https://www.allergyuk.org/getting-help/translation-cards\" rel=\"nofollow\">translation cards</a> and gives advice for coping with allergies when travelling. To ask students who might have been in your situation for advice, start a discussion on the <a href=\"http://tyaanswers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Third Year Abroad</a> website.</p> \n<h2>Research your destination</h2> \n<p> Find out how aware your host country is of your requirement. Awareness can vary considerably from place to place, even for common medical conditions. Jess Husbands studies French and Spanish at the University of Edinburgh, and is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">coeliac</a>. “Spain was much better than France for being coeliac: if I said ‘soy coeliaca’ in Spain, most people knew what it was. But in France no one had heard of it – I had to say ‘je suis allergique au bl&eacute;’ which is obviously not the same thing.”</p> \n<p>In France only <a href=\"http://www.afdiag.fr/intolerance-au-gluten/la-maladie-coeliaque/\" rel=\"nofollow\">10 to 20% of coeliacs</a> are diagnosed, making awareness levels much lower than in the UK. Coeliac UK provides useful <a href=\"https://www.coeliac.org.uk/gluten-free-diet-and-lifestyle/holidays-and-travel/country-guides/\" rel=\"nofollow\">country guides</a>, detailing awareness levels, and where to find products and local coeliac groups.</p> \n<h2><strong>Try new things</strong></h2> \n<p> Having to be a bit more creative with your culinary choices can turn into an advantage. Chlo&euml; Rose, a Jewish student at the University of Birmingham, spent a year in Spain: “I found out before I went that there was no Jewish community in Granada, which meant getting kosher food would be next to impossible. I decided the best option would be to go vegetarian.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jun/17/what-nobody-tells-students-about-studying-abroad\">What nobody tells you about studying abroad</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Although she missed eating meat, Rose didn’t struggle to find something she enjoyed eating. “Eating out can be difficult but we often went to restaurants where there are plenty of meat-free options. I expanded my range of what I eat a lot more than I did in Birmingham: I tried couscous, and I didn’t really eat eggs before, but now I feel better that I have more healthy options instead of just resorting to fish fingers or a frozen pizza. And if in doubt I always have tortilla.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Don’t worry!</strong></h2> \n<p> When preparing to go abroad, the threat of endless uninspiring dinners can fill restricted eaters with dread. But food is only one small aspect of life, as it is at home, and your diet won’t deprive you of your best memories. “There will always be something to eat,” adds Rose. “I knew that other parts of my year abroad – such as location and the university – were more important than what I was going to eat every day.”</p> \n<p> By taking the same precautions as you would at home, and doing research before arriving – as you would for any other aspect of your time abroad, like accommodation – there’s no reason why a restricted diet should get in the way of a great year.</p> \n<p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GdnStudents</a> – and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433777810531/Skull-and-crossed-bones-t-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"/Alamy","altText":"Skull and crossed bones toast","cleanCredit":"Photograph: /Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T11:30:13Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T11:47:51Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":130,"contributors":[{"name":"Fiona Henry","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/fiona-henry"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Students","Education","Higher education","International students","Studying abroad","Advice for students","Allergies","Food and drink","Vegetarianism"],"tags":[{"id":"education/students","webTitle":"Students"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"education/higher-education","webTitle":"Higher education"},{"id":"education/internationalstudents","webTitle":"International students"},{"id":"education/studying-abroad","webTitle":"Studying abroad"},{"id":"education/advice-for-students","webTitle":"Advice for students"},{"id":"society/allergies","webTitle":"Allergies"},{"id":"travel/travelfoodanddrink","webTitle":"Food and drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/vegetarianism","webTitle":"Vegetarianism"}],"section":{"id":"education"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Fiona Henry","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/fiona-henry"}}],"series":{"title":"The global student","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/education/series/the-global-student"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"education"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","quoteColour":"#fdadba","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jul/06/world-on-your-plate-how-to-cope-abroad-on-a-restricted-diet","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49thq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/education/2015/jul/06/world-on-your-plate-how-to-cope-abroad-on-a-restricted-diet","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/06/world-on-your-plate-how-to-cope-abroad-on-a-restricted-diet"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433777810531/Skull-and-crossed-bones-t-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Not everywhere will cater for your dietary requirements, so do your research before you travel.

It costs &pound;5 and is great value. Today we’re having slow-cooked lamb nihari, sag aloo, lentil dal, pilau rice, green salad and seekh kebab. At lunch, the place heaves with a wide range of people, and on Thursdays and Fridays you are lucky to get a table. The food is fresh, full of flavour and spicy without being overpowering.

In Rome, <em>tavola calda</em> establishments, where the food is laid out on a bar, are popular with office workers. Sometimes, it is self-service; sometimes, there is a server haring between tables. But the customers all get to sit down and relax.</p> \n<p>The right to a lunch break – like almost everything in Italy – is enshrined in a law. The length of break is up to employers, and one survey by an Italian online recruitment agency found that 30% of its clients seldom left their desks at lunchtime, with 60% saying that a shortage of time forced them to rush. Then again, the same survey found more than two-thirds took lunch breaks that lasted an hour or more.<strong> JH</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s slow food – I would never eat a sandwich in a bar, absolutely not</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Andrea Zazzara</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Andrea Zazzara, 43, lawyer<br /></strong>I’m normally in court until 1pm or 1.30pm, and then I have to go back to my chambers, so I generally don’t get out to lunch before 2pm. There’s a nice little trattoria nearby, so if I go out with colleagues, we ring ahead and say how many we are. The chef, Pasquale, will then cook us a pasta. But we don’t know what it is. It’s a surprise. He has a lot of imagination and revisits traditional recipes. My favourite is a spaghetti alla carbonara that he makes with tuna and courgette.</p> \n<p>There’s another fantastic place nearby. There are tables, though not many. It’s slow food, really: nice, healthy ingredients and genuine flavours. It’s a bit like having a meal at home. But it does get very crowded, because this is how Romans particularly like to have lunch.</p> \n<p>If I don’t have enough time, I’ll go to a place selling <em>pizza al taglio</em> (pizza sold in rectangular slices).

Lunchtime in midtown and downtown Manhattan is an exception, though. For those who aren’t stuck with sandwiches or salads at their desks, it’s a genuinely frenetic event, marked by a crazy multiplicity of choices: traditional diners and delis; “fast casual” chains serving burgers, burritos or customised salads composed from a selection of 60 ingredients; plus the new generation of food trucks, serving curries and pad thai, lobster rolls and bacon-flavoured ice-cream.<br /></p> \n<p>“Haste seems to be a controlling factor in the luncheon of the worker,” <a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/lunchhour/exhibits/show/lunchhour/quick\">declared an article in Munsey’s Magazine in 1901</a>, a few years before “<a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/lunchhour/exhibits/show/lunchhour/automat\">automats</a>” appeared in Times Square, offering pies and cakes from behind individual glass-fronted compartments, to shave off a few more seconds. The automats are gone, but the sense of haste lives on – although it’s recently grown easier to stop and breathe, too, thanks to the increase in pedestrianised areas, peppered with tables and chairs, orchestrated by Michael Bloomberg’s visionary transport commissioner, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/bike-blog/2011/jan/05/new-york-transportation-chief\">Janette Sadik-Khan</a>.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in New York, far grander things are happening at lunchtime: the city was the birthplace of the original “power lunch” (the phrase was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/14/world/americas/zagat-power-lunch-guide\">probably coined to describe meals at the Four Seasons restaurant, on 52nd Street</a>) and of the uptown, upmarket “ladies who lunch”, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_who_lunch\">a term popularised by New York magazine</a>. For the non-plutocrats, meanwhile, it’s a speedy but crucial change of scenery in the working day, marked by an ever-increasing range of food options. There are a thousand more tranquil places on the planet to eat your lunch, of course, but what New Yorkers know is that plunging into the manic energy of the city for half an hour can be just as restorative. <strong> OB</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>\u0007Lunch is, all too frequently, doing whatever I’m doing at my desk</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Amber Hoover</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Amber Hoover, 37, foreign rights specialist at a publishing firm<br /></strong>I’m eating braised beef over spinach, sriracha string beans and some sort of spring greens with onions.

They even have a phone app, so I can pay without having to bother with cash. Because I work in publishing, there’s an entertainment element to lunch that happens sometimes – once or twice a week, I’ll have a business lunch, a proper sit-down. The rest of the time, lunch is either like this or, all too frequently, crammed in at my desk while I keep doing whatever I’m doing.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rio de Janeiro </strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ae32ef5785e0597bccda5cdb6d7228de24b89a1\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435747535612/2d9530e8-3263-4c91-a7a0-6dfe5478ddee-346x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Clara Ara&uacute;jo having lunch in Rio de Janeiro\" width=\"346\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clara Ara&uacute;jo in Rio.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lianne Milton for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Typically, Cariocas [residents of Rio de Janeiro] lunch at a <em>restaurante &agrave; quilo,</em> a buffet where the price is determined by the weight of food on the plate. Almost all offer staple Brazilian fare, such as rice, <em>feij&atilde;o</em> (black beans), meat, <em>farofa</em> (toasted cassava flour) and <em>salgadinhos</em> (a variety of savoury snacks), alongside various other dishes.<br /></p> \n<p>Brazil has large and long-established Japanese, Italian and Middle Eastern communities, meaning sushi, spaghetti and <em>esfihas</em> (an unleavened bread pasty introduced by immigrants from Syria and Lebanon) are commonplace. Most <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants also boast a salad bar.</p> \n<p>They vary enormously in quality, price and atmosphere, but the high-end ones operate with the efficiency of a well-oiled production line. Customers are given tickets on their way in, form an orderly queue around the buffet, weigh their plates, then sit at a table where one of the waiting staff takes their order for drinks. Plates are cleared as soon as they are empty. Customers then queue again in front of the cashier, before handing their receipt to a member of staff who lurks by the exit. Lunch is often the only meal these restaurants serve, so ensuring a rapid flow of customers is key.</p> \n<p>For high-end professionals, there are more traditional restaurants with a set menu, but such establishments are relatively rare. At the other end of the scale, there are plenty of <em>lanchonetes</em>, snack bars that serve <em>salgadinhos</em> and fruit juices, where customers generally eat standing up.</p> \n<p>No one eats at their desk, because it’s considered bad manners, and grossly unhygienic. The importance of the lunch hour is such that the specific timing of the break is often written into contracts. Many workers also get food vouchers as part of their pay, with a daily allowance of about R$20 (&pound;4) loaded on to a credit card, accepted at most <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants. Eating out appeals to the Cariocas’ natural sociability, allowing colleagues to spend time together chewing the fat outside the office.<strong> BD</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Leaving the office is important, a chance to nourish myself and my creativity</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Clara Ara&uacute;jo</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Clara Ara&uacute;jo, 33, journalist for Criar Brasil, a media NGO<br /></strong>Today, I’m eating what I usually have for lunch: on one side of the plate I have a bit of salad, because my mother taught me it was important to have something healthy; on the other is the stuff I really like – a slice of meat in mushroom sauce and a couple of <em>esfihas</em>, one filled with meat and the other with cheese.</p> \n<p>I come to this restaurant regularly with my colleagues. We like it because it’s nearby and the food is varied and excellent value. All the <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants in the centre of Rio are busy and noisy at lunchtime, but this place is still kind of intimate. There are even a few booths where couples can sit close together. For me, leaving the office for lunch is important. I don’t cook, so bringing food into work is not an option. I also like to get away from work for a while. Leaving the office gives you a chance to nourish both your belly and your creativity. You get the chance to interact with your colleagues in a different way.</p> \n<h2><strong>Nairobi</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b7889632e89cb4a40f4f844844b2b785946f3e0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435747805710/b28d8cf9-1234-461d-91ad-f86bb3a5dab6-460x321.jpeg\" alt=\"jack okinyi having lunch in nairobi\" width=\"460\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Okinyi in Nairobi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sven Torfinn for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lunch is a raucous and communal affair in the Kenyan capital. For many, it’s an escape from the drudgery of desk jobs, and they gather in the large restaurants around the business district, where they share hour-long sit-down meals.<br /></p> \n<p>Not too many people have time for a proper breakfast before work. Cut-throat competition in schools means that the kids have to set off for class in the half-light of dawn; adults, too, generally leave home in the early hours, to beat the city’s notorious traffic. Lunch offers a welcome respite. At around midday, office workers troop out, in groups of three or four, and sometimes even seven or eight, to find a good spot in their favourite restaurant. Very few people go out for lunch alone.</p> \n<p>Local tastes vary, depending on affordability and a region’s culinary traditions. Cuisine from western Kenya is the most widespread, with smoked, fried or whole fish, sometimes stewed in coconut sauce – a popular choice. Those with a more adventurous palate can try boiled tilapia fish head, or chicken, beef or stewed goat tripe (the latter is a favourite at the popular <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ranalo-Foods-Kosewe/487365784662499\">Ranalo Foods</a> downtown). The national dish, <em>nyama choma</em> (goat rib roasted on an open spit), is mostly enjoyed on weekend afternoons with a couple of drinks.</p> \n<p>Some choose to have their lunch at cafeteria-style restaurants, where they queue and then go out into the sunshine with their plates. But on a recent, unusually chilly Wednesday afternoon (temperatures anywhere below 20C are considered too cold by Nairobians), two sisters who work in computer sales, Marissa Oluchina and Emma Mwongeli, explained that they prefer having lunch at Abu’s Place, located just behind the city’s main mosque, which specialises in coastal dishes. Abu’s mainstay is pilau (rice cooked in a seasoned broth), while Mwongeli names a dish from the mountain region of Kenya as her favourite: “There is nothing as good as a nice plate of githeri [a mix of stewed maize and beans], topped with fresh avocado, to set you off into the afternoon in a good mood.”<strong> MM</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I rarely have time for breakfast or dinner, so lunch is important.

The restaurant sources it from the freshwater Lake Victoria, which has very tasty fish.</p> \n<p>I always eat with a friend or two, since I do not enjoy eating alone. My favourite lunch is deep-fried whole tilapia with <em>osuga </em>(wild vegetables in cream) and brown ugali. At KSh 750 (about &pound;5), the meal is relatively expensive, but the restaurant is very clean and the service is world class.</p> \n<h2>Beijing</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13f1fed430292158f82e9722df66586b0ba15ca4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435748494723/6e34ba51-419a-498d-bab8-a31c2f0e7bbc-382x420.jpeg\" alt=\"zhang tong having lunch in beijing\" width=\"382\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zhang Tong in Beijing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Wasserman for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When it comes to a working lunch in Beijing, you can’t beat the <em>baozi</em>, or Chinese steamed bun. Legend has it taht the baozi was invented more than 1,800 years ago by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Liang\">Zhuge Liang</a>, a Chinese statesman and military strategist who is also credited with creating the wheelbarrow. Facing crisis when his hungry, dehydrated soldiers began to fall ill, Zhuge dreamed up the idea of making doughy, human head-shaped buns packed with pork and beef. They are said to have cured his sick warriors and guaranteed subsequent battlefield success.<br /></p> \n<p>Today, baozi can be found the length and breadth of China, and are eaten morning, noon and night by those in search of a quick, nutritious and filling snack. In China’s capital, where office workers generally get 45 minutes to an hour for their break, a lunch on the run means a trip to somewhere such as the Qingfeng Steamed Stuffed Bun Shop. With 290 outlets, Qingfeng is one of the city’s top bun makers, churning out 16 tonnes of baozi each day for famished Beijingers.</p> \n<p>The baozi is so much a part of popular culture that <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1392160/president-xi-buys-meal-beijing-bun-shop?page=all\">even president Xi Jinping popped into one of Qingfeng’s shops</a> in an attempt to burnish his man-of-the-people credentials. The restaurant subsequently created the “Zhu xi tao can” or “<a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-01/03/content_17214891.htm\">President Xi Jinping combo</a>” meal, which includes buns stuffed with onion and pork, stir-fried pig liver and intestine, and a plate of greens.</p> \n<p>There are pork and spring onion buns, pork and cabbage buns, prawn and vegetable buns, and vegetarian buns, each costing up to 4.5 yuan (46p). Also on the menu are bowls of pumpkin porridge – a snip at 3 yuan (30p) – pork and spring onion buns, which cost 3.5 yuan each (36p), and bowls of spicy cold noodles that sell for 9 yuan (92p). <strong> TP </strong><em>Additional reporting by Luna Lin</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s fast, it tastes OK and it’s safe.

There’s one just around the corner from here. The food is great, but the restaurant isn’t so clean. Sometimes I will eat with my colleagues and sometimes I dine alone – Chinese fast food chains are my go-to choices. I usually spend about 30 minutes having lunch. I hardly ever eat at my desk, because my job requires me to spend most of my working hours outside the office.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435746290308/tom-gilbert-and-david-coo-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tom Gilbart and David Cook having lunch in Phatha Phat in Manchester.

Activities (some of which you have to pay for) include volleyball, pedal boats, rowing, archery and street tennis. A similar idea is Les Berges de Seine, a stretch of the Left Bank between the bridges Pont Alexandre III and Pont du Carrousel that hosts a floating garden, outdoor bars, playgrounds, art installations and many free events, such as fitness classes and gardening workshops.

Dine on traditional French food at <a href=\"http://www.aubergedelabutte.com/\">l’Auberge de la Butte</a>, where €25 covers three courses. The legendary <a href=\"http://gladines-restaurant-paris.fr/\">Chez Gladines</a> offers copious Basque dishes from €7-€10, but go before 7pm to avoid a long wait. Most bars along rue de la Butte aux Cailles are reasonably priced, such as the popular hangout <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Diapason/422366761143509\">Le Diapason</a>, where glasses of wine are €4, pints are €5-€6 and cocktails are €6.50.</p> \n<h2>Enjoy a museum for free</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2966e19a16e7b81a98810a5b3989d7a5f6a2258a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435941445401/20841cc5-9355-4a45-a622-f02138d04468-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Musee Carnavalet, Paris, France\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mus&eacute;e Carnavalet.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: R Ian Lloyd/Masterfile/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On the first Sunday of the month, visits to permanent collections in national museums are free. <a href=\"http://www.louvre.fr/en\">The Louvre</a> always has a long queue but Paris has 173 other museums to choose from. Explore the city’s history in a magnificent building dating back to the Renaissance at the <a href=\"http://www.carnavalet.paris.fr/\">Mus&eacute;e Carnavalet</a> on Rue des Francs-Bourgeois, or learn about the middle ages at the <a href=\"http://www.musee-moyenage.fr/\">Mus&eacute;e de Cluny</a>, which is on top of Roman ruins that wildly contrast with their surroundings in the middle of the bustling 5th arrondissement.

Dealers often sell their goods cheaper at these two flea markets before raising the prices at Saint-Ouen. If strolling around the elite galleries of the Marais or Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s inspires you to invest in art, check out the squat <a href=\"http://www.59rivoli.org/main.html\">59 Rivoli</a>, where artists work and sell their creations.

Private rooms cost from €62 (it’s a bunk bed, though), while dorm-room berths start at €31.

The <a href=\"http://www.lavillette.com\">Parc de la Villette</a> has several unusual playgrounds, such as an 80m dragon whose tongue becomes a slide, the <a href=\"http://www.cite-sciences.fr/fr/au-programme/expos-permanentes/la-cite-des-enfants/\">Cit&eacute; des Enfants children’s museum (adults €12, kids under 6 €3)</a>, a merry-go-round, and holds frequent festivals and free movie screenings.

The other park is the <a href=\"http://www.paris.fr/jardins\">Bois de Boulogne</a> and, at more than double the size of Central Park in Manhattan, it feels more like a forest. It has an adult fitness playground, two horse-racing tracks (<a href=\"http://www.france-galop.com/France-Galop-courses-hippiqu.3964+M52087573ab0.0.html\">Hippodrome de Longchamp</a> and <a href=\"http://www.france-galop.com/Hippodrome-d-Auteuil.2809.0.html\">Hippodrome d’Auteuil</a>) that Hemingway used to frequent, greenhouses with exotic plants and mini-parks, such as the Parc de Bagatelle, featuring free botanic gardens and a guided ch&acirc;teau visit for €8.</p> \n<h2>Nightlife, music and more</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bbbfb145b947c4dafc0e00e6252b370e380b6ded\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435942066044/70e66609-b55d-4251-953a-b2c9b2667b1d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"People dancing on the Square Tino Rossi, Quai Saint-Bernard, Paris.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People dancing on the Square Tino Rossi, Quai Saint-Bernard.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa Press/REX Shutterstock</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Paris is not usually known for its sangria but <a href=\"http://www.lebar10.com/\">10 Bar</a> is famous with students and regulars of the 6th arrondissement for its €3 drinks and (working) jukebox.

Entry is free; you simply wander on to the quai on any night during July and August. If it’s raining, opt for live music at <a href=\"http://www.truskel.com/\">Le Truskel</a>, an innocuous-looking bar, on Rue Feydeau, known for its free concerts starring musicians before they get famous; Pete Doherty, Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party and Metronomy all played here.

All its bread is made before your eyes in a brick oven. In the Marais, try the <a href=\"http://marchedesenfantsrougesfr.com/\">March&eacute; des Enfants Rouges</a> on Rue de Bretagne; it’s Paris’s oldest market, where delicacies from all over the world share space with French produce.

A return ticket costs €8.70 and a visit to the ch&acirc;teau, now an archeology museum (<a href=\"http://musee-archeologienationale.fr/\">Mus&eacute;e d’Arch&eacute;ologie nationale</a>), is €7. A €5.50 return, and a 30-minute ride from Ch&acirc;telet on the RER B heading south, will get you to Sceaux, where you’ll discover another ch&acirc;teau with guided visits for €6. Its grounds, the <a href=\"http://domaine-de-sceaux.hauts-de-seine.net/informations-pratiques/acces-horaires-et-tarifs/\">Parc de Sceaux</a>, are free to visit and were designed by Le N&ocirc;tre, who was the landscaper of Versailles.
