I absolutely loved those trips. Byron has changed a lot since then. The population has grown rapidly, which some people have objected to, but it’s still very relaxed. And, of course, the beaches are just as beautiful as ever.</p> \n<p><strong>My dad would take my sisters and I surfing all day at The Pass</strong> – it’s a great beginners’ point-break wave. This kind of wave slowly breaks on one side so the surfer can ride the open face as it runs down the point. The ride is longer and better for a longer-length learner’s board. Even as an advanced surfer, point breaks are my favourite waves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56bc68577d71c128eac5caaf97d96c8dca57f69c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435857622551/63e98407-645d-4109-b7c6-a33289fe0aad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steph Gilmore\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Gilmore</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Women’s presence in surfing is growing rapidly.</strong> I see more and more girls, of all ages, in what were formerly male-dominated line-ups.

Either way, you arrive at a ramshackle boathouse shop (a curious mix of beach kit, souvenirs and tanks of live of crabs and lobsters), before taking a long flight of steps that meanders through a wild cliff garden to the cafe, run by the Northey family since 1910. The food may not be the finest (think jacket potatoes and cheese and pickle) but it is well worth the climb for the views, the chickens in the garden, the rustic picnic tables and the fresh crab sandwiches (&pound;7.25) made with crab caught and landed by the Northey family’s own fishing boat.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Cakes from &pound;1.25, sandwiches from &pound;4.50. 19 Riverside Crescent, Pentire Head, </em><a href=\"http://fernpit.co.uk/\"><em>fernpit.co.uk</em></a><em>.

Before Elsie Pinniger took over in April, this was a tired cafe-in-a-hut on a vintage mini golf course, close to Fistral but a bit off-the-beaten track. Elsie painted the hut black, renamed it (after the film, Happy Gilmore), added kitschy-California colour and drew up a budget menu of Mexican-style dishes. Now it’s a hip Newquay hangout– even the mini golf looks cool. The food’s the main thing, though. Start the day with Mexican eggs (perfectly cooked in a spiced tomato sauce with wilted spinach and a doorstep of buttered sourdough) or a huge breakfast burrito served with fresh tomato salsa and sour cream.

One of the most important and biodiverse protected areas in Europe, Do&ntilde;ana is home to the Iberian lynx (which you won’t see) and a favoured spot for waterfowl (which you will). The waters are packed with avocets, spoonbills, greylag geese, herons, flamingos, and various endangered ducks, although in high summer, much of the water disappears – as do many of the birds. Arranging a visit can be baffling. Only one company is authorised to drive visitors into the national park, and that’s <strong>Cooperativa Marismas del Roc&iacute;o</strong>, which offers a four-hour bus trip (+34 959 430 432, no website, <em>€</em>29.50pp). Another El Roc&iacute;o-based company, <a href=\"http://www.donanaacaballo.com/\"><strong>Do&ntilde;ana a Caballo</strong></a> (+34 674 219 568, <em>€</em>30pp), takes riding tours through the park and you can hike a bit. There are three visitor centres signposted off the A483 from Matalasca&ntilde;as to El Roc&iacute;o, from which to get information about short walking trails. <strong>El Acebuche</strong> is officially the main centre, but twitchers may prefer the trail from <strong>La Rocina</strong> which follows the course of a stream.</p> \n<p><strong>El Roc&iacute;o</strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8395070ffd167dc96db30d32712b0169c8d20ca7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435323464349/0acc51fa-546f-4eb0-a90e-71a0fd577778-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"El Rocio, view to Ermita del Rocio\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">El Roc&iacute;o.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Westend61</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Few places are as pleasantly weird as <a href=\"http://www.andalucia.com/province/huelva/rocio/home.htm\">El Roc&iacute;o</a> in mid-afternoon – you’ll think you’ve stumbled across the filmset of a western. Literally a backwater on the edge of the Do&ntilde;ana marshes, its wide streets are made of drifting sand, low-flying flamingos cross the plazas, people get around on horseback, every house has a hitching post, and the few shops sell flamenco dresses, Catholic trinkets, or riding boots. Once a year, at Pentecost in May, 1 million all-singing, all-dancing pilgrims converge in wagons and on horses to pay homage to the sparkling statue of Our Lady of El Roc&iacute;o, Queen of the Marsh – an event that’s only for the most nocturnal and devout of partygoers.</p> \n<p><strong>Ruta Brit&aacute;nica, Huelva</strong><br />When an earthquake struck Lisbon in 1755, Huelva city, which sits on marshland, wobbled like jelly and collapsed, so there’s little evidence of its long history as an Atlantic trading post. But this self-guided tour celebrates the peculiarities of its recent past. The British came to set up the Rio Tinto Mining Company in 1873, took copper and left suburbia, private clubs, Victorian bathrooms, library books and a steam railway, as well as a local passion for billiards, badminton, and golf and, most importantly, the very first football club in Spain (unfortunately, Huelva is currently on a losing streak). The colony lasted 81 years, finally dispersed by Franco in 1954. Huelva Experiences runs a tour of the route, which includes the anachronistically suburban <strong>Barrio Reina Victoria</strong>, a dock and station constructed by the Rio Tinto company, and, as an add-on, the tomb of William Martin AKA Glyndwr Michael, The Man Who Never Was, whose body – along with documents detailing fake invasions of Greece and Sardinia – washed ashore here during the Second World War for the attention of German spies as part of Operation Mincemeat.<br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Puerta del Atl&aacute;ntico Visitor Centre, +34 959 541 817, </em><a href=\"http://www.huelva.es/turismo/index.php?lang=en\"><em>huelva.es/turismo</em></a><em>; Huelva Experiences, +34 687 243 802, </em><a href=\"http://huelvaexperiences.com/rutas/colombina.aspx\"><em>huelvaexperiences.com</em></a><em>, adult €40, children €20, under-fours free</em></p> \n<p><strong>In the footsteps of Christopher Columbus</strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37005f89ed38d8299a8c562354d0730473970de5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435323902250/03c9768a-f91c-4749-aad6-51373c39b921-460x318.jpeg\" alt=\"Replicas of ships Columbus sailed to the Americas in at in La R&aacute;bida.\" width=\"460\" height=\"318\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Replicas of ships Columbus sailed to the Americas in at in La R&aacute;bida.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If it weren’t for the good people of Huelva, Columbus may never have reached the new world – his boats, sailors and funding were all procured from an 8-mile stretch along the steamy, sleepy Rio Tinto.</p> \n<p>The untouristy <strong>Ruta Colombina </strong>takes you to <strong>Moguer</strong> where, behind the blinding white walls of the medieval <strong>Santa Clara Monastery</strong>, Columbus talked the Abbess into persuading her nephew, King Ferdinand, to back his madcap venture. The tours of this well-preserved place are fascinating (especially of note are the translucent alabaster windows and the massive great storks’ nests on top).</p> \n<p>In <strong>Palos de la Frontera</strong>, 15 minutes’ drive south, there’s a collection of bits and bobs and a short docudrama about Columbus in what remains of <strong>the house of Mart&iacute;n Alonso Pinz&oacute;n</strong>, the influential, wealthy mariner who, with his two brothers, joined the explorer on that first voyage in 1492. At the <strong>Iglesia de San Jorge </strong>round the corner, you can stand in the very spot the royal order was read out to unenthusiastic villagers, explaining they were to set sail with this Col&oacute;n (Columbus) character to “certain parts of the ocean”. <strong>The Fontanilla</strong>, the old fountain at which the ships’ barrels were filled, is nearby but not the navigable river as its course was shifted in the Lisbon earthquake. So the excellent replicas of the three <em>caravales</em> that made the voyage – the Ni&ntilde;a, the Pinta and the Santa Mar&iacute;a – sit at a purpose-built dock, a little further south again in <strong>La R&aacute;bida</strong>, below the monastery that accommodated Columbus from 1491-1492 while he waited for his funds. <br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Moguer Tourist Office, +34 959 371 898.

From the “car park” at <strong>Cuesta Maneli</strong>, a wooden walkway of almost a mile leads up and over the lofty <strong>Duna del Asperillo</strong>, ending at the virgin beach, <strong>Playa de Castilla</strong>. Further east, towards Matalasca&ntilde;as, there’s a sign for the <strong>Laguna del Jaral </strong>trail. Here the trip to the beach and back is sufficiently long (3&frac12; miles) and adventurous (some hauling on a rope is required to get up and down the the sandy cliff) to put some people off hence a higher chance of splendid isolation. A third option is to head east from built-up Matalasca&ntilde;as into the protected beaches of the Do&ntilde;ana national park. <strong>The Beach Trail </strong>runs for 20 miles, ending on the banks of the Guadalquivir, opposite the fish restaurants of <strong>Sanl&uacute;car de Barrameda</strong>.</p> \n<p>For boat trips, there are few regions where it’s easier – or cheaper – to test the ocean waves, and there are innumerable operators up and down the coast. After watching boats slipping in and out of the marina at <strong>Mazag&oacute;n</strong>, you’ll want to be on one. The <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.rutasenbarcomazagon.es/&amp;prev=search\">Rutas en Barco Mazag&oacute;n</a> (+34 667 351 552, €25pp) runs dolphin-spotting, river estuary trips and voyages into Do&ntilde;ana. At the adventurous end of the spectrum, Huelva’s wide beaches are increasingly popular with kitesurfers. Centres in Isla Canela, Isla Cristina and El Portil offer kit rental, full courses and four-hour beginner sessions. Operators include <a href=\"http://www.islacanelakite.com/\">Isla Canela Kite el Paradise</a> (+34 646 280 860) or <a href=\"http://flechaextreme.com/\">Flecha Extreme</a> (+34 617 000 546) in El Portil, which also offers stand-up paddleboarding and kayaking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9ed13248b4f345f05496a051a229e0fc11bc093\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435324822499/543ccb22-f5e0-403d-83e3-f6baee5c710d-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Duna del Asperillo\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duna del Asperillo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you find the prospect of stumbling across nudists alarming, remain alert at all times when approaching the following areas (from west to east): <strong>Playa Flecha de Nueva Umbr&iacute;a</strong>, just south of Lepe (a mile or so beyond the village of Casas del Terr&oacute;n); <strong>Playa de la Mata Negra</strong>, just west of Punta Umbr&iacute;a where the Odiel Marshes meet the sea in a mass of pines, junipers and dunes; the 3-mile stretch between the Mazag&oacute;n parador and the photogenic Torre del Loro; and <strong>Playa del Asperillo </strong>and<strong> Playa de Castilla</strong>, both accessed from Cuesta Maneli on the road to Matalasca&ntilde;as. All have designated nudist beach areas, although “textiles” – clothes wearers – are welcome.</p> \n<p>An easy and jolly choice, <strong>Isla Cristina</strong>, wedged between marsh and sea, offers cream sand, lifeguards, a promenade, easy parking, a frontline of palms, small white hotels, bars, and restaurants serving cold beer, fresh sardines and <em>arroz marinero</em>. There are a selection of playas to suit everyone, from the family-friendly <strong>Playa del Carmen</strong> to <strong>La Redondela</strong> to the east, where you can abandon your car beside the wooden <em>chiringuito</em> (small bar) and follow the “chameleon route” through pine groves to find your own space in the dunes.</p> \n<p>Just west of Huelva, the river Piedras runs parallel to the coast, creating an 8-mile sandy spit, <strong>la Flecha del Rompido</strong>, and the beaches from El Rompido to El Portil are tucked behind it. So, emerging through the pines at Playa Nuevo Portil, you find yourself on one paradisiacal beach facing another, beyond which is a third and the Atlantic ocean. Small boats ferry people over the calm turquoise channel from three points along the length of la Flecha (€3 return). The sandbar is a protected area and utterly devoid of infrastructure, while <strong>Nuevo Portil </strong>benefits from a smattering of chiringuitos, among them Roman Chavez Mar&iacute;n’s friendly and chic KM6 (open 15 June-15 September), built from a shipping container, pallets and fruit boxes and shaded by sails. Come here for fresh fish at lunchtime, and for beach parties after dark.<br /></p> \n<h2>Where to eat<br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Ac&aacute;nthum, Huelva</strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9827a3d9d2a53d78857a31b3e9291223625faf7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435325081723/66d789d2-7b72-4142-867b-4e879f449a69-460x329.jpeg\" alt=\"Ac&aacute;nthum, Huelva Coast, Spain\" width=\"460\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ac&aacute;nthum, Huelva Coast, Spain</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Visit almost any restaurant along Huelva’s Costa de la Luz and you’ll find the same choice, which is fine because the fried every-type-of fish, seafood risotto, and jam&oacute;n from the sierras is universally excellent. Nevertheless, a new breed of young chefs in the city of Huelva have taken the level of sophistication, innovation, and creativity of local fare to a higher plane. Most notable is Xanty El&iacute;as, whose restaurant, Ac&aacute;nthum, was the first in the province to be awarded a “sol” in Spain’s prestigious Repsol Guide. El&iacute;as spent two years at three Michelin-starred Arzak in San Sebasti&aacute;n, and it shows: not just oysters, but oyster with <em>chicharrones</em> (fried pork rinds) and an apple infusion; not just ham, but ham hock tartar and mustard ice-cream, and so on. Go for haute tapas at the bar or book in advance for the tasting menu (€65). <br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Calle San Salvador 17, +34 959 245 135, </em><a href=\"http://www.acanthum.com/\"><em>acanthum.com</em></a><em> </em></p> \n<p><strong>Mes&oacute;n El Lobito, Moguer<br /></strong>I could imagine riding through this cavernous bodega, clopping over the courtyard cobbles drinking wine, while the chef cooked a leg of lamb or venison over an open fire. Run by the third generation of a local family, this atmospheric restaurant looks more like 500 years old than 60 with its thick white walls, barrels, dark corners and hunting trophies. It specialises in grilled meat – rabbit, oxtail, pork and veal – and there is fish, but asking for a light salad is a no-no.<br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Calle de R&aacute;bida 31; +34 959 370 660, </em><a href=\"http://www.mesonellobito.com/\"><em>mesonellobito.com</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Bodeguita de los Raposo, Moguer</strong> <br />There’s great food and no fuss at this unassuming, super-friendly local spot. Most people ignore the formal restaurant and cram into the patio, which is neon-lit and decorated with yokes, hoes, partridge cages, and things that look suspiciously like snares. What with that and europop on the radio, it may seem an inauspicious choice in this historic town, but the translucent ham (sliced from a leg dangling over the bar), the tongue-tingling ewe’s cheese, the piping-hot fried fish and spicy, oily patatas bravas can’t be bettered. A plus for ditherers is the check-box menu – a list of items available in €2,€3 or €4 portions, and set menus with wine from €11.50. <br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Calle Fuentes 60, +34 959 371 281, </em><em><a href=\"http://bodeguitadelosraposo.es/\">bodeguitadelosraposo.es</a></em></p> \n<p><strong>Restaurante Toru&ntilde;o, El Roc&iacute;o<br /></strong>To get a handle on the strange world that is the marshy outpost of El Roc&iacute;o and a good choice of <em>cocina onubense</em> (Huelva cooking), eat here. The walls are lined with old photos of locals playing guitar, riding through sand and mists, dancing flamenco and taking the patron saint on a tour of the town. Outside, in the shade of a 1,000-year-old olive tree, everyone appears to be related and inebriated, and waiters are serving drinks to well-turned out riders on well-turned out horses. The food is hearty, a perfect blend of local hunting, shooting, farming (partridge pat&eacute;, venison, duck and pork) and fishing (prawns, sole and “various wild fish”), the Atlantic being just down the road. Ornithologists in particular will appreciate the tooting and murmured quark-quark serenade of waterfowl sploshing through the adjacent marsh.<br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Plaza del Acebuchal 22, +34 959 442 323</em></p> \n<h2>Places to stay</h2> \n<p><strong>Mazagonia Hotel, Mazag&oacute;n</strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8eb6eecb0f8224af48c3bd471815e3df208093b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435325668656/a5f2ee6e-b575-4e5b-920d-2f7b1e84c8e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hotel Mazagonia, Huelva Coast, Spain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are views of an ocean liner in an urban oasis of pine and flowers at this cool boutique hotel.

Covering ecology, environment, agriculture and industry, it is full of futuristic, interactive stands and snack bars, but admission is horribly over-priced at €22.</p> \n<p>Still, it has brought attention to Marghera itself, a leafy mainland suburb of La Serenissima that houses a tight-knit community of Venetians who left the island part of the city because of soaring rents. Most residents commute each day to work in Venice’s restaurants, bars and hotels. Marghera is more genuinely Venetian than Venice itself, but without a tourist in sight, and it is worth a day trip for those who want a change from the famous sights.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7ef68d1767bfdd0f5084ac2247c56394a02e89a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435317802480/4b79236a-8440-4d8d-9d24-1ba8b89f0ed0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Fresh produce at Marghera market.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh produce at Marghera market</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The bus arrives at Piazza Mercato, a wide tree-lined boulevard which is crammed with stalls of the daily food market.

It was conceived as a utopian garden city for workers, following the philosophy of Sir Ebenezer Howard, the town planning guru behind Welwyn Garden City.

Escaping the reach of the city usually involved a long trek on a bus. My one salvation was Tres Bocas – an island in the Rio Paran&aacute; delta. It only entailed a short train journey to Tigre, and a 40-minute boat ride (about &pound;8).</p> \n<p>Each year, on my return to Argentina with my family, I still head here. The island’s main restaurant and only shop is El Hornero, astride a small tributary, a short amble along a mud track from the landing bay.

The alfesco setting enhances the eating experience (there’s no interior just a small grocer shop) and we arrive hungry. Having eaten long and well, we sit back under the cool, dappled light and polish off the remaining malbec, while the kids scamper off, ice-creams in hand, to explore the island.</p> \n<p>Though only an hour away, the bustle and grind of the city seem a distant prospect. The only sound that might break the tranquillity is the distant chug of a boat or the hiss of the <em>cigarras</em> (crickets). The waters gurgle past and the late-afternoon light slants through the birch trees. For now, for this short while, all is fine.</p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435145343912/7cef43d0-3be3-4358-b480-f804b9cefd15-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"M G Therin Weise/Getty Images","altText":"Tigre, Paraná Delta, Argentina.
