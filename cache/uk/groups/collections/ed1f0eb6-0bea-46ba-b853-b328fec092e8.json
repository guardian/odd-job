It was an ethical and practical decision: a vegetarian diet is cheap, easy and accepted in the UK – plus it justified my excessive peanut butter habit. </p> \n<p>Then came a boeuf bourguignon-shaped spanner in the works: I moved to France for a year to study. It soon became clear that I was going to struggle – while the meat-free food market is worth around &pound;657m in the UK, according to a <a href=\"http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/number-of-global-vegetarian-food-and-drink-product-launches-doubles-between-2009-and-2013http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/food-and-drink/number-of-global-vegetarian-food-and-drink-product-launches-doubles-between-2009-and-2013\" rel=\"nofollow\">recent estimate</a>, demand in France is much smaller.</p> \n<p>With <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/oct/26/french-government-banning-vegetarianism-schools\">vegan meals effectively banned</a> in school canteens, Quorn not always available in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrefour\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carrefour</a>, and my host family’s horror that I wasn’t “much of a meat-eater” – not to mention the subpar peanut butter – the practical advantages of vegetarianism had gone.</p> \n<p> For me, compromise was the best option – while not cooking meat for myself, I was keen to avoid insult or hassle so ate what I was given. Besides, I reasoned, food is a major part of every culture – would I really be getting into the year-abroad mindset if I refused to try local, traditional foods?</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/mortarboard/2013/jun/24/veganism-on-a-student-budget\">Veganism on a student budget</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p> But for students with medical or religious reasons for restricted diets, or who are just less hypocritical than myself, flexibility isn’t an option. So how can you navigate a year abroad on a restricted diet?</p> \n<h2>Come prepared</h2> \n<p> Abigail Jones (not her real name) studies French and Italian at the University of Kent, and is allergic to nuts, as well as mosquito bites. She found preparation key for her time in Switzerland and Italy: “I keep a ready supply of the stuff I need in case I get bitten or eat something. Make sure you know exactly how to explain to waiters that you have an allergy, so you don’t accidentally order something that could make you ill.” </p> \n<p>Allergy UK offers <a href=\"https://www.allergyuk.org/getting-help/translation-cards\" rel=\"nofollow\">translation cards</a> and gives advice for coping with allergies when travelling. To ask students who might have been in your situation for advice, start a discussion on the <a href=\"http://tyaanswers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Third Year Abroad</a> website.</p> \n<h2>Research your destination</h2> \n<p> Find out how aware your host country is of your requirement. Awareness can vary considerably from place to place, even for common medical conditions. Jess Husbands studies French and Spanish at the University of Edinburgh, and is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease\" rel=\"nofollow\">coeliac</a>. “Spain was much better than France for being coeliac: if I said ‘soy coeliaca’ in Spain, most people knew what it was. But in France no one had heard of it – I had to say ‘je suis allergique au bl&eacute;’ which is obviously not the same thing.”</p> \n<p>In France only <a href=\"http://www.afdiag.fr/intolerance-au-gluten/la-maladie-coeliaque/\" rel=\"nofollow\">10 to 20% of coeliacs</a> are diagnosed, making awareness levels much lower than in the UK. Coeliac UK provides useful <a href=\"https://www.coeliac.org.uk/gluten-free-diet-and-lifestyle/holidays-and-travel/country-guides/\" rel=\"nofollow\">country guides</a>, detailing awareness levels, and where to find products and local coeliac groups.</p> \n<h2><strong>Try new things</strong></h2> \n<p> Having to be a bit more creative with your culinary choices can turn into an advantage. Chlo&euml; Rose, a Jewish student at the University of Birmingham, spent a year in Spain: “I found out before I went that there was no Jewish community in Granada, which meant getting kosher food would be next to impossible. I decided the best option would be to go vegetarian.” </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jun/17/what-nobody-tells-students-about-studying-abroad\">What nobody tells you about studying abroad</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Although she missed eating meat, Rose didn’t struggle to find something she enjoyed eating. “Eating out can be difficult but we often went to restaurants where there are plenty of meat-free options. I expanded my range of what I eat a lot more than I did in Birmingham: I tried couscous, and I didn’t really eat eggs before, but now I feel better that I have more healthy options instead of just resorting to fish fingers or a frozen pizza. And if in doubt I always have tortilla.”</p> \n<h2><strong>Don’t worry!</strong></h2> \n<p> When preparing to go abroad, the threat of endless uninspiring dinners can fill restricted eaters with dread. But food is only one small aspect of life, as it is at home, and your diet won’t deprive you of your best memories. “There will always be something to eat,” adds Rose. “I knew that other parts of my year abroad – such as location and the university – were more important than what I was going to eat every day.”</p> \n<p> By taking the same precautions as you would at home, and doing research before arriving – as you would for any other aspect of your time abroad, like accommodation – there’s no reason why a restricted diet should get in the way of a great year.</p> \n<p><strong>Keep up with the latest on Guardian Students: follow us on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gdnstudents\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GdnStudents</a> – and <a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/students/\">become a member</a> to receive exclusive benefits and our weekly newsletter.</strong></p>","section":"Education","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433777810531/Skull-and-crossed-bones-t-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"/Alamy","altText":"Skull and crossed bones toast","cleanCredit":"Photograph: /Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T11:30:13Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T11:47:51Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":127,"contributors":[{"name":"Fiona Henry","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/fiona-henry"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Students","Education","Higher education","International students","Studying abroad","Advice for students","Allergies","Food and drink","Vegetarianism"],"tags":[{"id":"education/students","webTitle":"Students"},{"id":"education/education","webTitle":"Education"},{"id":"education/higher-education","webTitle":"Higher education"},{"id":"education/internationalstudents","webTitle":"International students"},{"id":"education/studying-abroad","webTitle":"Studying abroad"},{"id":"education/advice-for-students","webTitle":"Advice for students"},{"id":"society/allergies","webTitle":"Allergies"},{"id":"travel/travelfoodanddrink","webTitle":"Food and drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/vegetarianism","webTitle":"Vegetarianism"}],"section":{"id":"education"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Fiona Henry","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/fiona-henry"}}],"series":{"title":"The global student","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/education/series/the-global-student"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"education"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/education/2015/jul/06/world-on-your-plate-how-to-cope-abroad-on-a-restricted-diet","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49thq","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/education/2015/jul/06/world-on-your-plate-how-to-cope-abroad-on-a-restricted-diet","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/jul/06/world-on-your-plate-how-to-cope-abroad-on-a-restricted-diet"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/8/1433777810531/Skull-and-crossed-bones-t-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Not everywhere will cater for your dietary requirements, so do your research before you travel.

At <a href=\"http://www.creativeconcern.com\">Creative Concern</a>, an ethical media agency in the ever fashionable Northern Quarter (NQ), “gin o’clock” is a sacred institution on Fridays at 4pm, joined occasionally by “wine on Wednesdays” if they are having a particularly good (or bad) week.<br /></p> \n<p>While Manchester’s evening dining options are still not up to London’s standards, the former <a href=\"http://www.mosi.org.uk/explore-mosi/explore-revolution-manchester/revolution-manchester-themes/cottonopolis.aspx\">Cottonopolis</a> excels at cheap lunch eats. <a href=\"http://www.katsourisdeli.co.uk/\">Katsouris</a>, a deli on Deansgate, one of the main thoroughfares, has a queue out the door every day, offering a range of hot roast meat sarnies for &pound;3.50 a pop (&pound;4, if you plump for the mutant granary bap), as well as ridiculously large plates of paella and Middle Eastern meze. <a href=\"http://www.philpotts.co.uk/our-shops/\">Philpotts</a>, a superlative sandwich chain originally founded in Chester, puts Pret to shame, though the latter is always hoaching on Cross Street.</p> \n<p>Manchester is also very good at soup: <a href=\"http://www.shlurp.co.uk\">Shlurp</a>, on Brazennose Street, offers an ever-changing menu of seasonal, locally sourced soups, and is a favourite of council workers at the nearby cavernous town hall.

It’s a tiny, no-frills place hidden down a back alley, but it is all about the food.</p> \n<p>Every day, the staff prepare a fresh selection of curries, daals and kebabs, and you take your pick with some rice and a salad. It costs &pound;5 and is great value. Today we’re having slow-cooked lamb nihari, sag aloo, lentil dal, pilau rice, green salad and seekh kebab. At lunch, the place heaves with a wide range of people, and on Thursdays and Fridays you are lucky to get a table. The food is fresh, full of flavour and spicy without being overpowering. This sort of restaurant represents what I love about my home city: friendly and lacking in pretension, but excellent quality.</p> \n<h2><strong>Rome</strong><br /></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96ac13a448c0565647d11a785823d43fd8e72305\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435748965406/5d35efa5-36ae-4756-92e1-699ae1f6a907-339x420.jpeg\" alt=\"andrea zazzara having lunch in rome\" width=\"339\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andrea Zazzara in Rome.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chiara Goia for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Three years ago, the government carried out a survey to find out how many people ate their lunch at home. The answer was 74.3%, a figure that says much about a country in which less than half of women have a paid job; one in which most of the population lives and works in villages, towns or small cities, where employees and employers alike can often get home for lunch and maybe even fit in a <em>pisolino</em> (nap) afterwards.<br /></p> \n<p>Shopping, or doing any other kind of business, in an Italian provincial town is usually impossible between 1.30 and 3pm. And many establishments don’t reopen till 3.30 or even 4pm. Government ministers have more than once railed against the Italian lunch break, or <em>pausa pranzo</em>. One called it “a ritual that brings the whole of Italy to a stop”.</p> \n<p>But the picture among city office workers is very different. In Rome, <em>tavola calda</em> establishments, where the food is laid out on a bar, are popular with office workers. Sometimes, it is self-service; sometimes, there is a server haring between tables. But the customers all get to sit down and relax.</p> \n<p>The right to a lunch break – like almost everything in Italy – is enshrined in a law. The length of break is up to employers, and one survey by an Italian online recruitment agency found that 30% of its clients seldom left their desks at lunchtime, with 60% saying that a shortage of time forced them to rush. Then again, the same survey found more than two-thirds took lunch breaks that lasted an hour or more.<strong> JH</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s slow food – I would never eat a sandwich in a bar, absolutely not</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Andrea Zazzara</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Andrea Zazzara, 43, lawyer<br /></strong>I’m normally in court until 1pm or 1.30pm, and then I have to go back to my chambers, so I generally don’t get out to lunch before 2pm.

My favourite is a spaghetti alla carbonara that he makes with tuna and courgette.</p> \n<p>There’s another fantastic place nearby. There are tables, though not many.

Lunchtime in midtown and downtown Manhattan is an exception, though. For those who aren’t stuck with sandwiches or salads at their desks, it’s a genuinely frenetic event, marked by a crazy multiplicity of choices: traditional diners and delis; “fast casual” chains serving burgers, burritos or customised salads composed from a selection of 60 ingredients; plus the new generation of food trucks, serving curries and pad thai, lobster rolls and bacon-flavoured ice-cream.<br /></p> \n<p>“Haste seems to be a controlling factor in the luncheon of the worker,” <a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/lunchhour/exhibits/show/lunchhour/quick\">declared an article in Munsey’s Magazine in 1901</a>, a few years before “<a href=\"http://exhibitions.nypl.org/lunchhour/exhibits/show/lunchhour/automat\">automats</a>” appeared in Times Square, offering pies and cakes from behind individual glass-fronted compartments, to shave off a few more seconds. The automats are gone, but the sense of haste lives on – although it’s recently grown easier to stop and breathe, too, thanks to the increase in pedestrianised areas, peppered with tables and chairs, orchestrated by Michael Bloomberg’s visionary transport commissioner, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/environment/bike-blog/2011/jan/05/new-york-transportation-chief\">Janette Sadik-Khan</a>.</p> \n<p>Elsewhere in New York, far grander things are happening at lunchtime: the city was the birthplace of the original “power lunch” (the phrase was <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/14/world/americas/zagat-power-lunch-guide\">probably coined to describe meals at the Four Seasons restaurant, on 52nd Street</a>) and of the uptown, upmarket “ladies who lunch”, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies_who_lunch\">a term popularised by New York magazine</a>. For the non-plutocrats, meanwhile, it’s a speedy but crucial change of scenery in the working day, marked by an ever-increasing range of food options. There are a thousand more tranquil places on the planet to eat your lunch, of course, but what New Yorkers know is that plunging into the manic energy of the city for half an hour can be just as restorative. <strong> OB</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>\u0007Lunch is, all too frequently, doing whatever I’m doing at my desk</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Amber Hoover</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Amber Hoover, 37, foreign rights specialist at a publishing firm<br /></strong>I’m eating braised beef over spinach, sriracha string beans and some sort of spring greens with onions.

Almost all offer staple Brazilian fare, such as rice, <em>feij&atilde;o</em> (black beans), meat, <em>farofa</em> (toasted cassava flour) and <em>salgadinhos</em> (a variety of savoury snacks), alongside various other dishes.<br /></p> \n<p>Brazil has large and long-established Japanese, Italian and Middle Eastern communities, meaning sushi, spaghetti and <em>esfihas</em> (an unleavened bread pasty introduced by immigrants from Syria and Lebanon) are commonplace. Most <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants also boast a salad bar.</p> \n<p>They vary enormously in quality, price and atmosphere, but the high-end ones operate with the efficiency of a well-oiled production line. Customers are given tickets on their way in, form an orderly queue around the buffet, weigh their plates, then sit at a table where one of the waiting staff takes their order for drinks. Plates are cleared as soon as they are empty. Customers then queue again in front of the cashier, before handing their receipt to a member of staff who lurks by the exit. Lunch is often the only meal these restaurants serve, so ensuring a rapid flow of customers is key.</p> \n<p>For high-end professionals, there are more traditional restaurants with a set menu, but such establishments are relatively rare. At the other end of the scale, there are plenty of <em>lanchonetes</em>, snack bars that serve <em>salgadinhos</em> and fruit juices, where customers generally eat standing up.</p> \n<p>No one eats at their desk, because it’s considered bad manners, and grossly unhygienic. The importance of the lunch hour is such that the specific timing of the break is often written into contracts. Many workers also get food vouchers as part of their pay, with a daily allowance of about R$20 (&pound;4) loaded on to a credit card, accepted at most <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants. Eating out appeals to the Cariocas’ natural sociability, allowing colleagues to spend time together chewing the fat outside the office.<strong> BD</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Leaving the office is important, a chance to nourish myself and my creativity</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Clara Ara&uacute;jo</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p><strong>My lunch: Clara Ara&uacute;jo, 33, journalist for Criar Brasil, a media NGO<br /></strong>Today, I’m eating what I usually have for lunch: on one side of the plate I have a bit of salad, because my mother taught me it was important to have something healthy; on the other is the stuff I really like – a slice of meat in mushroom sauce and a couple of <em>esfihas</em>, one filled with meat and the other with cheese.</p> \n<p>I come to this restaurant regularly with my colleagues. We like it because it’s nearby and the food is varied and excellent value. All the <em>&agrave; quilo</em> restaurants in the centre of Rio are busy and noisy at lunchtime, but this place is still kind of intimate. There are even a few booths where couples can sit close together. For me, leaving the office for lunch is important. I don’t cook, so bringing food into work is not an option. I also like to get away from work for a while. Leaving the office gives you a chance to nourish both your belly and your creativity. You get the chance to interact with your colleagues in a different way.</p> \n<h2><strong>Nairobi</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b7889632e89cb4a40f4f844844b2b785946f3e0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435747805710/b28d8cf9-1234-461d-91ad-f86bb3a5dab6-460x321.jpeg\" alt=\"jack okinyi having lunch in nairobi\" width=\"460\" height=\"321\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Okinyi in Nairobi.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sven Torfinn for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Lunch is a raucous and communal affair in the Kenyan capital. For many, it’s an escape from the drudgery of desk jobs, and they gather in the large restaurants around the business district, where they share hour-long sit-down meals.<br /></p> \n<p>Not too many people have time for a proper breakfast before work. Cut-throat competition in schools means that the kids have to set off for class in the half-light of dawn; adults, too, generally leave home in the early hours, to beat the city’s notorious traffic. Lunch offers a welcome respite. At around midday, office workers troop out, in groups of three or four, and sometimes even seven or eight, to find a good spot in their favourite restaurant. Very few people go out for lunch alone.</p> \n<p>Local tastes vary, depending on affordability and a region’s culinary traditions. Cuisine from western Kenya is the most widespread, with smoked, fried or whole fish, sometimes stewed in coconut sauce – a popular choice. Those with a more adventurous palate can try boiled tilapia fish head, or chicken, beef or stewed goat tripe (the latter is a favourite at the popular <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ranalo-Foods-Kosewe/487365784662499\">Ranalo Foods</a> downtown). The national dish, <em>nyama choma</em> (goat rib roasted on an open spit), is mostly enjoyed on weekend afternoons with a couple of drinks.</p> \n<p>Some choose to have their lunch at cafeteria-style restaurants, where they queue and then go out into the sunshine with their plates. But on a recent, unusually chilly Wednesday afternoon (temperatures anywhere below 20C are considered too cold by Nairobians), two sisters who work in computer sales, Marissa Oluchina and Emma Mwongeli, explained that they prefer having lunch at Abu’s Place, located just behind the city’s main mosque, which specialises in coastal dishes. Abu’s mainstay is pilau (rice cooked in a seasoned broth), while Mwongeli names a dish from the mountain region of Kenya as her favourite: “There is nothing as good as a nice plate of githeri [a mix of stewed maize and beans], topped with fresh avocado, to set you off into the afternoon in a good mood.”<strong> MM</strong></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I rarely have time for breakfast or dinner, so lunch is important.

I usually grab a snack at dinner time (or sometimes forget to), but I can never miss lunch. I work in downtown Nairobi, so most of the time I take my lunch there.</p> \n<p>My favourite restaurant is <a href=\"http://www.ranalofoods.com/\">Ranalo Foods</a>, which specialises in the traditional cuisine of my Luo people; <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/us-news/2015/may/29/barack-obama-srs-grave-makeover-hopes-us-president-may-visit\">Barack Obama Sr</a> is one of our more famous kinsmen. Most of the time, I have fish and a brown millet cake known as ugali. The fish can be deep-fried, smoked or boiled, but it is always tilapia. The restaurant sources it from the freshwater Lake Victoria, which has very tasty fish.</p> \n<p>I always eat with a friend or two, since I do not enjoy eating alone. My favourite lunch is deep-fried whole tilapia with <em>osuga </em>(wild vegetables in cream) and brown ugali. At KSh 750 (about &pound;5), the meal is relatively expensive, but the restaurant is very clean and the service is world class.</p> \n<h2>Beijing</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"13f1fed430292158f82e9722df66586b0ba15ca4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435748494723/6e34ba51-419a-498d-bab8-a31c2f0e7bbc-382x420.jpeg\" alt=\"zhang tong having lunch in beijing\" width=\"382\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zhang Tong in Beijing.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Wasserman for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>When it comes to a working lunch in Beijing, you can’t beat the <em>baozi</em>, or Chinese steamed bun. Legend has it taht the baozi was invented more than 1,800 years ago by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhuge_Liang\">Zhuge Liang</a>, a Chinese statesman and military strategist who is also credited with creating the wheelbarrow. Facing crisis when his hungry, dehydrated soldiers began to fall ill, Zhuge dreamed up the idea of making doughy, human head-shaped buns packed with pork and beef. They are said to have cured his sick warriors and guaranteed subsequent battlefield success.<br /></p> \n<p>Today, baozi can be found the length and breadth of China, and are eaten morning, noon and night by those in search of a quick, nutritious and filling snack. In China’s capital, where office workers generally get 45 minutes to an hour for their break, a lunch on the run means a trip to somewhere such as the Qingfeng Steamed Stuffed Bun Shop. With 290 outlets, Qingfeng is one of the city’s top bun makers, churning out 16 tonnes of baozi each day for famished Beijingers.</p> \n<p>The baozi is so much a part of popular culture that <a href=\"http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1392160/president-xi-buys-meal-beijing-bun-shop?page=all\">even president Xi Jinping popped into one of Qingfeng’s shops</a> in an attempt to burnish his man-of-the-people credentials. The restaurant subsequently created the “Zhu xi tao can” or “<a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2014-01/03/content_17214891.htm\">President Xi Jinping combo</a>” meal, which includes buns stuffed with onion and pork, stir-fried pig liver and intestine, and a plate of greens.</p> \n<p>There are pork and spring onion buns, pork and cabbage buns, prawn and vegetable buns, and vegetarian buns, each costing up to 4.5 yuan (46p). Also on the menu are bowls of pumpkin porridge – a snip at 3 yuan (30p) – pork and spring onion buns, which cost 3.5 yuan each (36p), and bowls of spicy cold noodles that sell for 9 yuan (92p). <strong> TP </strong><em>Additional reporting by Luna Lin</em></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It’s fast, it tastes OK and it’s safe.

There are vegetarian ones, shrimp ones and pork ones, too. They cost 15-20 yuan (&pound;1.50-&pound;2). It is fast food, it tastes OK and it’s safe. Because of all the food scandals in China, I look for restaurants that are clean and tidy.</p> \n<p>In Beijing, common folk also go to restaurants that sell <em>zhajiang mian</em> – fried sauce noodles. There’s one just around the corner from here. The food is great, but the restaurant isn’t so clean. Sometimes I will eat with my colleagues and sometimes I dine alone – Chinese fast food chains are my go-to choices. I usually spend about 30 minutes having lunch. I hardly ever eat at my desk, because my job requires me to spend most of my working hours outside the office.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435746290308/tom-gilbert-and-david-coo-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tom Gilbart and David Cook having lunch in Phatha Phat in Manchester.

Nowadays, tourists treat a large part of the region in much the same way – barely touching the ground at Brindisi or Bari before speeding south to newly trendy Salento, Puglia’s far southern tip (which we’ve covered in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2014/apr/25/italy-puglia-salento-region\">a separate guide</a>).</p> \n<p>What they’re missing as they charge pell-mell for Lecce, Gallipoli et al is a profusion of medieval hilltop towns, olive groves, a coastline peppered with interesting towns, more olive groves, restaurant menus stuffed with local speciality dishes, two national parks, vineyards, yet more olive groves, and enough <em>castelli</em>, <em>cattedrali</em> and <em>palazzi</em> to keep even the most demanding of history buffs content. Oh, and Europe’s largest colony of pink flamingos.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/puglia-travel/giv-212774PgrifIEEokY/\" data-alt=\"Puglia map\"> \n <a href=\"http://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2015/07/puglia-travel/giv-212774PgrifIEEokY/\">Puglia map</a> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2014/apr/25/italy-puglia-salento-region\">Unspoilt Italy: fall head over heel for Puglia's Salento region</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The geography is fairly simple. The uplands are in the <a href=\"http://www.parks.it/parco.nazionale.gargano/Eindex.php\">Gargano promontory</a> in the north-east and the <a href=\"http://www.parks.it/parco.nazionale.alta.murgia/Eindex.php\">Alta Murgia national park</a> in the west, while the rest of the region is flatter, often pockmarked with small hills topped with a settlement of some sort. There are several hundred miles of Adriatic coastline to the east, a chunk of Ionian Sea to the south, and a brace of large, wildlife-rich lakes in the north (Varano and Lesina), which are separated from the sea by low hills and sand dunes.</p> \n<p>Since Puglia is basically the shape of an upturned hockey stick, finding a way to see all this is an uncomplicated affair. Hug the coast from Vieste in the north-east to Brindisi in the south, before turning inland to take in the citt&agrave; bianche. Then strike west to Alta Murgia, north to the mysterious hilltop Castel del Monte to experience one of its wonderful sunsets, west to Foggia and then back into the Gargano to complete the loop.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, take the train – the main line passes through Foggia before heading for the coast – to visit Trani, Bari, Polignano a Mare and Brindisi. The branch lines that crisscross the region are great for inexpensive day trips to places such as Altamura, Gioia del Colle or the citt&agrave; bianche.</p> \n<p>However you explore the place, just remember to take an empty stomach.</p> \n<h2>What to see</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5270ec7f657d38aa2c9bb21112ce52c4fbc77f7\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e5270ec7f657d38aa2c9bb21112ce52c4fbc77f7/0_65_4272_2562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The harbour and cathedral at Trani.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s unfortunate that most visitors’ first taste of Puglia is the sprawling mess of <em>autostrade</em> and industrial units around Bari airport. <strong>Bari </strong>itself has its moments – the narrow, cobbled streets of the old town by the Basilica di San Nicola and the 12th-century <a href=\"http://pugliaimperiale.com/turismo/wheretogo/beniculturali/content.asp?art=13&amp;lang=EN\">Castello Svevo</a> (Swabian castle) are worth a wander and you can sample some <em>ciambotta</em>, the local fish-based stew – but the port city is rather down at heel. At least <strong>Brindisi</strong>, the region’s other gateway, has spruced itself up in recent years. Broad thoroughfares of blanched stone flanked by tall palms brim with little shops and tempting places to eat.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>The ancient settlement of Alberobello is so well preserved it’s been given Unesco World Heritage status</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p>Look up on the wall of any restaurant in the region and there’s a good chance you’ll see a picture of Puglia’s favourite son, Padre Pio, who died in 1968 but was canonised 34 years later. Decked out in the brown habit of the Capuchin friars, the kindly San Pio gazes benignly down upon the faithful. Up on the Gargano peninsula, the astonishing, new shell-like church built by <a href=\"http://www.rpbw.com/project/50/padre-pio-pilgrimage-church/\">Renzo Piano at San Giovanni Rotondo</a>, where Pio worked, is already a magnet for pilgrims.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d94fcc8ef651fdd0d9b3605293af38d35c3cec1\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d94fcc8ef651fdd0d9b3605293af38d35c3cec1/0_94_1393_836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trulli huts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trulli scrumptious … Stone dwellings in Alberobello.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2004/aug/21/italy.salento\">Why Italians love Salento: great weather, beaches and party atmosphere</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Almost as numerous as San Pio sightings are Puglia’s <em>trulli</em>. Most abundant in the <strong>Valle d’Itria</strong>, just north-west of Salento, these small beehive-like stone dwellings give the landscape the appearance of having been scattered with upturned ice-cream cones. While most can be seen in the midst of plots of mature olive trees made square through decades of judicious pruning – the town of <strong>Alberobello</strong> boasts 1,400 trulli in a maze of narrow streets. The ancient settlement is so well preserved it’s been given Unesco World Heritage status. Just don’t mention hobbits – they’ve heard it before.</p> \n<p><strong>Alberobello</strong> is just one of Valle d’Itria’s string of <em>citt&agrave; bianche</em> or white towns, each on their own little hilltop rising up from the plain and each staring out defiantly at the rest, as if the days of petty fiefdoms were still with us. The white historic quarters of <strong>Cisternino</strong>, <strong>Martina Franca</strong>, <strong>Ceglie Messapica</strong>, <strong>Ostuni</strong> and <strong>Locorotondo</strong> are all worth a gander and are within easy striking distance of one another, making a day’s medieval hilltop citt&agrave; tour pretty much <em>obbligatorio</em> if you’re in the neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>All these towns, though, are dwarfed by the northern stronghold of <strong>Foggia</strong>, where ancient churches and palaces are so numerous it makes you wonder what the city’s inhabitants did beyond worshipping and living it up.</p> \n<p>By the sea there’s a good mixture of wild coastline and more happening spots. Among the latter is <strong>Trani</strong>, a slow food city (do try a <em>moscato di trani</em>, the local dessert wine) whose pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance is a magnificent Swabian fortress and a <a href=\"http://pugliaimperiale.com/turismo/wheretogo/beniculturali/content.asp?art=14\">Romanesque cathedral</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fb2ed1dcc4efa356c93a18f62cd086b789facdf\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5fb2ed1dcc4efa356c93a18f62cd086b789facdf/0_463_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polignano a Mare\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polignano a Mare’s tiny cove.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/may/09/italy-hotels-great-food-agriturismo\">10 of the best country hotels in Italy with great food</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, ask locals what their favourite seaside resort is and you’ll hear one name over and over again: <strong>Polignano a Mare</strong>. About 20 miles south-east of Bari, Polignano has a compact medieval quarter that might have been designed expressly for lovers of indolent pre-prandial ambles. The little town pushes itself right to the edge of limestone cliffs undercut by caves hewn by the ceaseless nibbling and gnawing of the Adriatic, while its tiny and postcard-pretty beach could be a Cornish cove, if it weren’t for the terrace of tall venerable buildings.</p> \n<p>North up the coast is the <strong>Sentiero Airone</strong> nature reserve, home to those pink flamingos. The reserve is squeezed between the forest and peaks of the <a href=\"http://www.parks.it/parco.nazionale.gargano/Eindex.php\"><strong>Gargano national park</strong></a>, which spreads over the eponymous northern peninsula, and the <a href=\"http://www.parcoaltamurgia.gov.it/uk/\"><strong>Alta Murgia national park</strong></a>, a high limestone plateau where, in one particular cave, are no fewer than 30,000 dinosaur footprints.<br /></p> \n<p>That’s not even the region’s most dramatic subterranean feature. <a href=\"http://www.grottedicastellana.it/en/\"><strong>Castellana Grotte</strong></a> (about 12 miles south-west from Polignano a Mare) is a two-mile-long labyrinth of passages and caverns – making a particularly welcome diversion on a hot summer day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"142e7a720ce4b78b4ac54040fc5ff2159bb9dba1\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/142e7a720ce4b78b4ac54040fc5ff2159bb9dba1/0_19_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Castellana Grotte\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the labyrinth … Castellana Grotte.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giuseppe Cacace/AFP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Back above ground, while there’s no classic cycling route through the region, seven miles have so far been opened of the <strong>Ciclovia dell’Acquedotto</strong>, a cycle path through the Valle d’Itria which will eventually form part of a 155-mile route through Puglia. Walkers, meanwhile, should head for the Alta Murgia national park where wardens lead <a href=\"http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/puglia/parco-alta-murgia\">day-long hikes</a> taking in castles and prehistoric tombs, falcons and sinkholes.</p> \n<h2>Where to eat</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ea652d1a13dee6258957ee5dc95fde37e4d8be3\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6ea652d1a13dee6258957ee5dc95fde37e4d8be3/0_13_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Mint Cucina Fresca\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mint Cucina Fresca, Polignano a Mare</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The region’s star attraction is the food. Relatively impoverished though Puglia may be, the Pugliese take their <em>alimento</em> very seriously indeed. As might be expected, seafood dishes predominate, with squid a favourite ingredient, but there’s also a host of local specialities. The inland town of <strong>Altamura</strong> produces bread prized all over Italy. It’s baked in wooden ovens to a recipe unchanged since the Middle Ages, with the <em>u pu&egrave;ne muedde</em> loaf cheekily mimicking a priest’s hat. <strong>Gioia del Colle</strong> is the place to go for mozzarella and burrata cheese; while in <strong>Murgia</strong>, <em>cardoncello</em> mushrooms and <em>lampascioni</em> (wild onions) abound. And wherever you are, you can order <em>fave e cicoria</em>, a traditional peasant dish consisting of a warm broad-bean p&acirc;t&eacute; mixed with the local olive oil and served with bitter chicory. Washed down with a carafe of an Apulian <em>primitivo</em>, of course.</p> \n<blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n <p>Seafood dishes predominate, with squid a favourite ingredient, but there’s also a host of local specialities</p> \n</blockquote> \n<p><strong>Mint Cucina Fresca, Polignano a Mare</strong><br />A bijou restaurant providing a break from the pasta, pizza and lead-with-the-meat joints, Mint’s ultra-healthy-eating philosophy produces dishes packed with organic seasonal ingredients sourced locally. <br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Via San Benedetto 32, + 39 080 424 1373, closed on Mondays, </em><a href=\"http://www.mintcucinafresca.com/\"><em>mintcucinafresca.com</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Trabucco di Montepucci, Montestrione, near Peschici</strong><br />This family restaurant is on the oldest of Gargano’s <em>trabucchi</em> (offshore fishing platforms).

And, of course, the beaches are just as beautiful as ever.</p> \n<p><strong>My dad would take my sisters and I surfing all day at The Pass</strong> – it’s a great beginners’ point-break wave. This kind of wave slowly breaks on one side so the surfer can ride the open face as it runs down the point. The ride is longer and better for a longer-length learner’s board.

The festival has earned the title of Capitale Mondiale Delle Luminarie and is very popular, so it’s a good idea to arrive early to avoid traffic queues – the city organises huge parking areas outside the village.<br /> <a href=\"http://www.santadomenicascorrano.it/web/category/english/\"><em>santadomenicascorrano.it</em></a> <strong><br />Yolandanda </strong></p> \n<h2><strong>Otranto jazz festival</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6998f0d9d7b8e4a0b9ae2418911bbe8e39bcc042\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435759727811/64664aa6-b6e6-45c7-9d25-297df976640c-460x305.jpeg\" alt=\"Artists at Otranto Jazz Festival.\" width=\"460\" height=\"305\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artists at Otranto Jazz Festival, Puglia, Italy.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: http://otrantojazzfestival.it</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> The historical walled town of Otranto is worth visiting in its own right, to walk through cobbled streets, chill out on the beach or stroll around the harbour with a local <em>panzerrotti</em> (a sort of cheese-and-ham mini pizza) but it really becomes animated and lively during the week-long <a href=\"http://otrantojazzfestival.it/\">summer jazz festival</a>, a not-for-profit affair held in the grounds of the castle overlooking the town (from 24 July in 2015).

The peninsula’s network takes in the unmissable ports of Otranto and Gallipoli, Bari and Brindisi, as well as the splendid inland towns of Lecce and Ostuni. Don’t miss the line connecting Martina Franca, Locorotondo and Alberobello, which winds through flower-filled valleys where <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/530ef8bee4b0fa8384b0c413/855753\">untouched Trulli houses</a> are scattered through the olive groves.
