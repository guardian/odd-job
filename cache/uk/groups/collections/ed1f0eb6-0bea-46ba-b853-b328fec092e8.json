Activities (some of which you have to pay for) include volleyball, pedal boats, rowing, archery and street tennis.

Dine on traditional French food at <a href=\"http://www.aubergedelabutte.com/\">l’Auberge de la Butte</a>, where €25 covers three courses. The legendary <a href=\"http://gladines-restaurant-paris.fr/\">Chez Gladines</a> offers copious Basque dishes from €7-€10, but go before 7pm to avoid a long wait. Most bars along rue de la Butte aux Cailles are reasonably priced, such as the popular hangout <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Le-Diapason/422366761143509\">Le Diapason</a>, where glasses of wine are €4, pints are €5-€6 and cocktails are €6.50.</p> \n<h2>Enjoy a museum for free</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2966e19a16e7b81a98810a5b3989d7a5f6a2258a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/3/1435941445401/20841cc5-9355-4a45-a622-f02138d04468-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Musee Carnavalet, Paris, France\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mus&eacute;e Carnavalet.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: R Ian Lloyd/Masterfile/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On the first Sunday of the month, visits to permanent collections in national museums are free. <a href=\"http://www.louvre.fr/en\">The Louvre</a> always has a long queue but Paris has 173 other museums to choose from.

Dealers often sell their goods cheaper at these two flea markets before raising the prices at Saint-Ouen. If strolling around the elite galleries of the Marais or Saint-Germain-des-Pr&eacute;s inspires you to invest in art, check out the squat <a href=\"http://www.59rivoli.org/main.html\">59 Rivoli</a>, where artists work and sell their creations.

The other park is the <a href=\"http://www.paris.fr/jardins\">Bois de Boulogne</a> and, at more than double the size of Central Park in Manhattan, it feels more like a forest.

Entry is free; you simply wander on to the quai on any night during July and August. If it’s raining, opt for live music at <a href=\"http://www.truskel.com/\">Le Truskel</a>, an innocuous-looking bar, on Rue Feydeau, known for its free concerts starring musicians before they get famous; Pete Doherty, Franz Ferdinand, Bloc Party and Metronomy all played here.

All its bread is made before your eyes in a brick oven. In the Marais, try the <a href=\"http://marchedesenfantsrougesfr.com/\">March&eacute; des Enfants Rouges</a> on Rue de Bretagne; it’s Paris’s oldest market, where delicacies from all over the world share space with French produce.

A return ticket costs €8.70 and a visit to the ch&acirc;teau, now an archeology museum (<a href=\"http://musee-archeologienationale.fr/\">Mus&eacute;e d’Arch&eacute;ologie nationale</a>), is €7. A €5.50 return, and a 30-minute ride from Ch&acirc;telet on the RER B heading south, will get you to Sceaux, where you’ll discover another ch&acirc;teau with guided visits for €6. Its grounds, the <a href=\"http://domaine-de-sceaux.hauts-de-seine.net/informations-pratiques/acces-horaires-et-tarifs/\">Parc de Sceaux</a>, are free to visit and were designed by Le N&ocirc;tre, who was the landscaper of Versailles.

For centuries rampaging armies used this heel of Italy as a convenient motorway en route to richer pickings further afield. Nowadays, tourists treat a large part of the region in much the same way – barely touching the ground at Brindisi or Bari before speeding south to newly trendy Salento, Puglia’s far southern tip (which we’ve covered in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2014/apr/25/italy-puglia-salento-region\">a separate guide</a>).</p> \n<p>What they’re missing as they charge pell-mell for Lecce, Gallipoli et al is a profusion of medieval hilltop towns, olive groves, a coastline peppered with interesting towns, more olive groves, restaurant menus stuffed with local speciality dishes, two national parks, vineyards, yet more olive groves, and enough <em>castelli</em>, <em>cattedrali</em> and <em>palazzi</em> to keep even the most demanding of history buffs content.

The uplands are in the <a href=\"http://www.parks.it/parco.nazionale.gargano/Eindex.php\">Gargano promontory</a> in the north-east and the <a href=\"http://www.parks.it/parco.nazionale.alta.murgia/Eindex.php\">Alta Murgia national park</a> in the west, while the rest of the region is flatter, often pockmarked with small hills topped with a settlement of some sort. There are several hundred miles of Adriatic coastline to the east, a chunk of Ionian Sea to the south, and a brace of large, wildlife-rich lakes in the north (Varano and Lesina), which are separated from the sea by low hills and sand dunes.</p> \n<p>Since Puglia is basically the shape of an upturned hockey stick, finding a way to see all this is an uncomplicated affair. Hug the coast from Vieste in the north-east to Brindisi in the south, before turning inland to take in the citt&agrave; bianche. Then strike west to Alta Murgia, north to the mysterious hilltop Castel del Monte to experience one of its wonderful sunsets, west to Foggia and then back into the Gargano to complete the loop.</p> \n<p>Alternatively, take the train – the main line passes through Foggia before heading for the coast – to visit Trani, Bari, Polignano a Mare and Brindisi. The branch lines that crisscross the region are great for inexpensive day trips to places such as Altamura, Gioia del Colle or the citt&agrave; bianche.</p> \n<p>However you explore the place, just remember to take an empty stomach.</p> \n<h2>What to see</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e5270ec7f657d38aa2c9bb21112ce52c4fbc77f7\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/e5270ec7f657d38aa2c9bb21112ce52c4fbc77f7/0_65_4272_2562/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trani\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The harbour and cathedral at Trani.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s unfortunate that most visitors’ first taste of Puglia is the sprawling mess of <em>autostrade</em> and industrial units around Bari airport. <strong>Bari </strong>itself has its moments – the narrow, cobbled streets of the old town by the Basilica di San Nicola and the 12th-century <a href=\"http://pugliaimperiale.com/turismo/wheretogo/beniculturali/content.asp?art=13&amp;lang=EN\">Castello Svevo</a> (Swabian castle) are worth a wander and you can sample some <em>ciambotta</em>, the local fish-based stew – but the port city is rather down at heel. At least <strong>Brindisi</strong>, the region’s other gateway, has spruced itself up in recent years.

Decked out in the brown habit of the Capuchin friars, the kindly San Pio gazes benignly down upon the faithful. Up on the Gargano peninsula, the astonishing, new shell-like church built by <a href=\"http://www.rpbw.com/project/50/padre-pio-pilgrimage-church/\">Renzo Piano at San Giovanni Rotondo</a>, where Pio worked, is already a magnet for pilgrims.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d94fcc8ef651fdd0d9b3605293af38d35c3cec1\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/4d94fcc8ef651fdd0d9b3605293af38d35c3cec1/0_94_1393_836/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Trulli huts\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trulli scrumptious … Stone dwellings in Alberobello.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2004/aug/21/italy.salento\">Why Italians love Salento: great weather, beaches and party atmosphere</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Almost as numerous as San Pio sightings are Puglia’s <em>trulli</em>. Most abundant in the <strong>Valle d’Itria</strong>, just north-west of Salento, these small beehive-like stone dwellings give the landscape the appearance of having been scattered with upturned ice-cream cones. While most can be seen in the midst of plots of mature olive trees made square through decades of judicious pruning – the town of <strong>Alberobello</strong> boasts 1,400 trulli in a maze of narrow streets. The ancient settlement is so well preserved it’s been given Unesco World Heritage status. Just don’t mention hobbits – they’ve heard it before.</p> \n<p><strong>Alberobello</strong> is just one of Valle d’Itria’s string of <em>citt&agrave; bianche</em> or white towns, each on their own little hilltop rising up from the plain and each staring out defiantly at the rest, as if the days of petty fiefdoms were still with us. The white historic quarters of <strong>Cisternino</strong>, <strong>Martina Franca</strong>, <strong>Ceglie Messapica</strong>, <strong>Ostuni</strong> and <strong>Locorotondo</strong> are all worth a gander and are within easy striking distance of one another, making a day’s medieval hilltop citt&agrave; tour pretty much <em>obbligatorio</em> if you’re in the neighbourhood.</p> \n<p>All these towns, though, are dwarfed by the northern stronghold of <strong>Foggia</strong>, where ancient churches and palaces are so numerous it makes you wonder what the city’s inhabitants did beyond worshipping and living it up.</p> \n<p>By the sea there’s a good mixture of wild coastline and more happening spots. Among the latter is <strong>Trani</strong>, a slow food city (do try a <em>moscato di trani</em>, the local dessert wine) whose pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance is a magnificent Swabian fortress and a <a href=\"http://pugliaimperiale.com/turismo/wheretogo/beniculturali/content.asp?art=14\">Romanesque cathedral</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fb2ed1dcc4efa356c93a18f62cd086b789facdf\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/5fb2ed1dcc4efa356c93a18f62cd086b789facdf/0_463_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Polignano a Mare\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Polignano a Mare’s tiny cove.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/may/09/italy-hotels-great-food-agriturismo\">10 of the best country hotels in Italy with great food</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>However, ask locals what their favourite seaside resort is and you’ll hear one name over and over again: <strong>Polignano a Mare</strong>. About 20 miles south-east of Bari, Polignano has a compact medieval quarter that might have been designed expressly for lovers of indolent pre-prandial ambles. The little town pushes itself right to the edge of limestone cliffs undercut by caves hewn by the ceaseless nibbling and gnawing of the Adriatic, while its tiny and postcard-pretty beach could be a Cornish cove, if it weren’t for the terrace of tall venerable buildings.</p> \n<p>North up the coast is the <strong>Sentiero Airone</strong> nature reserve, home to those pink flamingos. The reserve is squeezed between the forest and peaks of the <a href=\"http://www.parks.it/parco.nazionale.gargano/Eindex.php\"><strong>Gargano national park</strong></a>, which spreads over the eponymous northern peninsula, and the <a href=\"http://www.parcoaltamurgia.gov.it/uk/\"><strong>Alta Murgia national park</strong></a>, a high limestone plateau where, in one particular cave, are no fewer than 30,000 dinosaur footprints.<br /></p> \n<p>That’s not even the region’s most dramatic subterranean feature. <a href=\"http://www.grottedicastellana.it/en/\"><strong>Castellana Grotte</strong></a> (about 12 miles south-west from Polignano a Mare) is a two-mile-long labyrinth of passages and caverns – making a particularly welcome diversion on a hot summer day.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"142e7a720ce4b78b4ac54040fc5ff2159bb9dba1\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/142e7a720ce4b78b4ac54040fc5ff2159bb9dba1/0_19_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Castellana Grotte\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Into the labyrinth … Castellana Grotte.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Giuseppe Cacace/AFP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Back above ground, while there’s no classic cycling route through the region, seven miles have so far been opened of the <strong>Ciclovia dell’Acquedotto</strong>, a cycle path through the Valle d’Itria which will eventually form part of a 155-mile route through Puglia. Walkers, meanwhile, should head for the Alta Murgia national park where wardens lead <a href=\"http://www.lifeinitaly.com/tourism/puglia/parco-alta-murgia\">day-long hikes</a> taking in castles and prehistoric tombs, falcons and sinkholes.</p> \n<h2>Where to eat</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ea652d1a13dee6258957ee5dc95fde37e4d8be3\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/6ea652d1a13dee6258957ee5dc95fde37e4d8be3/0_13_720_432/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Mint Cucina Fresca\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Mint Cucina Fresca, Polignano a Mare</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The region’s star attraction is the food. Relatively impoverished though Puglia may be, the Pugliese take their <em>alimento</em> very seriously indeed. As might be expected, seafood dishes predominate, with squid a favourite ingredient, but there’s also a host of local specialities. The inland town of <strong>Altamura</strong> produces bread prized all over Italy. It’s baked in wooden ovens to a recipe unchanged since the Middle Ages, with the <em>u pu&egrave;ne muedde</em> loaf cheekily mimicking a priest’s hat. <strong>Gioia del Colle</strong> is the place to go for mozzarella and burrata cheese; while in <strong>Murgia</strong>, <em>cardoncello</em> mushrooms and <em>lampascioni</em> (wild onions) abound. And wherever you are, you can order <em>fave e cicoria</em>, a traditional peasant dish consisting of a warm broad-bean p&acirc;t&eacute; mixed with the local olive oil and served with bitter chicory.

I absolutely loved those trips. Byron has changed a lot since then. The population has grown rapidly, which some people have objected to, but it’s still very relaxed. And, of course, the beaches are just as beautiful as ever.</p> \n<p><strong>My dad would take my sisters and I surfing all day at The Pass</strong> – it’s a great beginners’ point-break wave. This kind of wave slowly breaks on one side so the surfer can ride the open face as it runs down the point. The ride is longer and better for a longer-length learner’s board. Even as an advanced surfer, point breaks are my favourite waves.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"56bc68577d71c128eac5caaf97d96c8dca57f69c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435857622551/63e98407-645d-4109-b7c6-a33289fe0aad-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Steph Gilmore\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Gilmore</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Women’s presence in surfing is growing rapidly.</strong> I see more and more girls, of all ages, in what were formerly male-dominated line-ups.

The location helps: a former storeroom, decorated with salvaged timber, beach-hut decor and with an open kitchen. The property extends on to an elevated terrace overlooking Fistral beach. And the food (refined without being pretentious) is among the best in town. The a la carte menu is a little more expensive (&pound;13.95 for a generous plate of fish curry with <em>basmati</em>, <em>raita</em> and <em>papadums</em>) but the light lunch menu is great value: tiger prawns cooked in garlic and chilli with homemade <em>focaccia</em>, <em>moules frites</em> or crispy squid with Greek salad and aioli. My daily special (two fresh, grilled mackerel fillets, cooked in a curry paste with a zingy tomato and coriander salad) was billed as a starter (from &pound;6.50) but with a bowl of crisp, hand-cut chips (&pound;2.50) it made an excellent lunch for just under &pound;10.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Lunches from &pound;6.95, mains from &pound;11.50.

Either way, you arrive at a ramshackle boathouse shop (a curious mix of beach kit, souvenirs and tanks of live of crabs and lobsters), before taking a long flight of steps that meanders through a wild cliff garden to the cafe, run by the Northey family since 1910. The food may not be the finest (think jacket potatoes and cheese and pickle) but it is well worth the climb for the views, the chickens in the garden, the rustic picnic tables and the fresh crab sandwiches (&pound;7.25) made with crab caught and landed by the Northey family’s own fishing boat.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Cakes from &pound;1.25, sandwiches from &pound;4.50. 19 Riverside Crescent, Pentire Head, </em><a href=\"http://fernpit.co.uk/\"><em>fernpit.co.uk</em></a><em>.

The idea is to be a seaside fuelling station: hop in and out between surfs, grab a bacon roll (&pound;3.95), a <em>nasi goreng</em> (&pound;7.95) or a fish chilli burger (&pound;5.95). The space is open-plan and has canteen tables and lots of rope and steel, though it also lacks a little soul. For me, the Goan chicken curry lacked spice; ditto the <em>pad</em> <em>thai</em> (ask to have the chilli ramped up if you like more heat). Favourites on the Asian menu are the rich, meaty lamb<em> karahi</em> and the buttery vegetable <em>makhanwala</em> – order both; these dishes work best when shared.

The lunch menu looks basic – just hot sandwich of the day or an “all-in salad box” – but a lot goes into a Gusto dish. In the box, there are five or six vegan salads, plus a choice of “two proteins” (pulled Cornish pork, salt beef, roast lamb, two varieties of falafel, chicken, crab or fish fritters), a drizzle of spicy dressing (mild pickled mango, chilli and garlic or Moroccan pesto, among others) and a chunk of freshly-baked bread (including a splendid wholemeal focaccia with a crisp salted crust). The hot sandwich is no mean little toastie, either. Mine was a generous flatbread wrap filled with boneless lamb rib and served with salads and a feta-and-mint fritter.

Start the day with Mexican eggs (perfectly cooked in a spiced tomato sauce with wilted spinach and a doorstep of buttered sourdough) or a huge breakfast burrito served with fresh tomato salsa and sour cream.

But it was nearly lost for ever: in the 1970s, the Khmer Rouge ordered that Cambodia’s pepper vines be grubbed up and replaced with rice paddies.</p> \n<p>However, some farmers in the Kampot province kept alive the skills and traditions of pepper cultivation and in the 1990s started producing small amounts in the rainy, quartz-rich hillsides that run down to the Gulf of Thailand.</p> \n<p>It was well received, and this year the world price of Kampot pepper rose to an all-time high – with farmers saying they’re still only producing about 30% of demand. The best are cultivated using organic methods, with crab shells as fertiliser to nurture the climbing stems, and fallen branches as supports.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90f3b00db3204094e3f3285f8f2f4c1527eed7c2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435251945836/e63c66df-51ac-46e1-9be9-fbce1562af9f-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg\" alt=\"Kampot pepper on bush.\" width=\"315\" height=\"189\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Ptschelinzew/Getty Images/Lonely Planet Image</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Kampot pepper goes well with fish and shellfish, and is available by mail order in black, white or pink, but in Cambodia you can eat fresh green peppercorns still on their edible stalks: they’re served all over the country but are at their best in their home province. The seaside town of Kep, near the Vietnamese border, is the crab capital of south-east Asia, and restaurants in its seafront crab market – a collection of stilted shacks – sell fried, freshly caught crab with Kampot pepper. That’s a world-class treat for just &pound;2-3.</p> \n<p>Or to get even more involved, there’s the nearby <a href=\"http://www.thevineretreat.com/\">Vine Retreat</a> (doubles from $25), an organic pepper farm with accommodation, yoga and saltwater swimming pool.</p> \n<p><strong> <br /></strong></p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Travel/Late_offers/pictures/2015/6/25/1435251635710/crabby-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Crab fried with green peppercorns.
