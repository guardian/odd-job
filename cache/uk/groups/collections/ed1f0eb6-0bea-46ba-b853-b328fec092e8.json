Forget standing in a crowded bar trying to avoid being stabbed in the eye by a tourist wielding a cocktail stick loaded with chorizo: it’s time for a proper meal, with chairs, and tables. But restaurants in a place such as Barcelona can empty your wallet quickly; the answer is a men&uacute; del d&iacute;a, the ubiquitous set lunch. The best offer good value and quality and they’ll see you through to the evening and back on the tapas trail.</p> \n<p><strong>All men&uacute;s here include three courses, a drink and bread unless stated</strong></p> \n<h2>La Polpa, Eixample</h2> \n<p>A wander up Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia is pretty much a must-do, whether you’re gawping at Gaud&iacute; buildings or heading for the shops. But the Eixample is proper moneyed Barcelona. The shops, the people, and the restaurants are expensive. That’s why La Polpa, a couple of blocks off the Passeig, is such a find. It’s got linen napkins, smartly dressed staff and a patina of posh, but the men&uacute; is still only €10.30. That really is astonishingly good value for this part of town. The food is modern and expertly turned out. A standout was an exceptionally tasty loin of tuna in teriyaki sauce. Even the house wine, a muscat, was a cut above the usual men&uacute; offerings.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€10.30 for the men&uacute;.

Carrer de l’Hospital, all phone shops and dive bars, is fascinating and when you want a break you can duck into the courtyard of the 15th-century Hospital de la Santa Creu. It’s a lovely quiet space and there’s a little open-air restaurant, El Jardi, which puts out great food from its tiny kitchen. It’s not fancy stuff but delicious. I had a thick leek and potato soup packed with flavour and a hearty lentil and sausage casserole. Handily, this place ticks another spot off the Gaud&iacute; trail: the old hospital is where the architect died after being knocked down by a tram in 1926.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€9.90 for the men&uacute;.</em> <em>Carrer de l’Hospital 56, +34 933 291 550, </em><a href=\"http://www.eljardibarcelona.es/\"><em>eljardibarcelona.es</em></a><em>.

It claims to be the oldest restaurant in Barcelona and the men&uacute; doesn’t feel like it has changed in a couple of hundred years. It’s always packed with Spanish families, gossiping <em>abuelas</em> and tourists. And they all look like they are having a very good time. Individual dishes are such good value (goose with apples is lovely, filling and only €9.50) that they almost make the €17.50 men&uacute; look expensive, but three courses give plenty of time to enjoy the atmosphere.

Given its climate and location, Iceland imports most of its fruit and vegetables. But at Fridheimar farm, near the town of Selfoss, 30 miles from Reykjavik, a large greenhouse produces 300 tonnes of them a year. Big, red, implausibly juicy specimens are harvested there every single day, despite the long, dark winters. Its farm cafe makes a great place to stop for a bloody mary with a brilliant tomato tang, or a perfect bowl of tomato soup.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a833dc4b2bf425f6b0e2d4ee0e0fb016a1d90c55\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113342848/eb9e6bb0-6fc5-4336-b4f5-caedad707ed7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside a greenhouse at Fridheimar, where geothermal energy is used to grow fruit and vegetables.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside a greenhouse at Fridheimar, where geothermal energy is used to grow fruit and vegetables.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arctic-Images/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/apr/30/top-10-hotels-in-reykjavik\">Top 10 hotels in Reykjavik</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The farm’s Arctic location actually works in its favour: there are fewer pests here, and warm ocean currents keep the climate deceptively warm. Also, Iceland’s geothermal energy creates enough electricity to heat and light the plants all year round. A volcanic growing medium is used in place of soil and 600 bumble bees imported from Holland take care of pollination.</p> \n<p>It’s a major operation: the farm uses 1.2 megawatts of electric power, the equivalent of the domestic use of a town of 3,000 people. Computers control heat, humidity, CO2, lighting, and watering, while weather stations on the rooftops monitor wind speed and direction and sunlight.</p> \n<p>As well as the cafe, there are talks and exhibitions, riding demonstrations and a foodie souvenir shop. The bloody mary recipe is a secret, says Kn&uacute;tur Rafn &Aacute;rmann, who runs the farm with his wife Helena and their five children.

If you know there are foods you love that are easy to get to, why wouldn’t you have a go at &shy;collecting them? I can’t think of anything nicer than eating food you’ve caught yourself. <br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/foraging\">Foraging</a> is great for all ages and you don’t need much kit to get started. A good knife helps and a bag to store your goods in. Start by taking a walk along the coastline. If you’re armed with a pocket book to identify species, you’ll find the experience so much more satisfying. <br /></p> \n<p>Rock pools are great for finding the odd largish crab or little fish, but I always find that if you walk along the rocks, you’ll find a bit of sea spinach growing, or some samphire. It’s best to go <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/foraging\">foraging</a> on an outgoing tide so everything is fresh and wet. <br /></p> \n<p>Avoid anywhere built-up or near harbours and marinas because of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/pollution\">pollution</a>. Don’t pick up anything if you don’t know what it is or anything dead. <br /></p> \n<p>One of my favourite catches is prawns. Last summer, my &shy;neighbour called me over – we have a little &shy;pontoon outside the front of our house in Brixham, Devon. He’d caught about 150 prawns and we sat on our steps and boiled them. We had a bottle of wine, looking out to sea, and wolfed them down in 20 minutes. Perfect.<strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Sea beets (also known as sea spinach)</strong><br />You can find these on rocky shores. Boil them in a pan over a fire – they’re a bit like tough leeks – and naturally salty. A spoonful or two of ricotta is a delicious addition, along with a bit of olive oil or butter, and plenty of black pepper. Available all year round but best between April and July.</p> \n<p><strong>Clams and mussels</strong><br />Wait until low tide when it should be easier to spot clam beds; rake along the shoreline and wait for them to come to the top. Boil them in a pan over your camp fire and add a couple of dashes of sherry, then throw in some finely chopped onion, coriander and a bay leaf.</p> \n<p><strong>Samphire</strong><br />Look out for samphire on muddy flats around estuaries or tidal creeks. You can eat the young types now. Laver seaweed, the basis of Welsh laver bread, is another easy find. Boil it down then add a bit of seasoning, use olive oil and lemon juice.</p> \n<p><strong>Crabs</strong><br />You can either hunt in rockpools or use a crabbing line – near a jetty is good. Boil in salted seawater over your beach fire for around 20 minutes. Smash them up and eat with crusty bread and mayonnaise, with your feet in the water.</p> \n<p><strong>Prawns</strong><br />Find a jetty where there’s seaweed hanging down, get yourself a little net and just lie on the pontoon, scooping all the way along the weeds. Just boil them in some seawater or salt water. Lemon juice, mayonnaise and bread optional.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Recipe for steamed clams over seaweed</strong><br />1. Dig a shallow hole a little smaller than the width of your grill. Line with stones and light a fire to make your beach barbecue.</p> \n<p>2. Put a little water in a pan and heat over your barbecue.</p> \n<p>3. Place a bunch of seaweed – bladderwrack (black in colour with pods) is one of the most plentiful – in the pan so it covers the water.</p> \n<p>4. Lay your clams over the seaweed, ideally with some wild fennel if <br />it’s handy. </p> \n<p>5. Season, cover with foil and let the clams steam for 8-10 minutes. (This is even tastier made with white fish but mackerel is good too if you can catch any.) Best served with crisp white wine and a spicy slaw.<em><br />Words by Rosie Ifould.

The walks are not circular, but some hotels offer drop-offs and pick-ups, and guesthouses can put hikers in touch with local drivers.</p> \n<p>One day we checked out the elegant stone bridges built by those Ottoman traders from the 17th century onwards. Kokkoros, soaring between natural limestone pillars, and the three-humped Plakidas bridge near Kipi, were particularly memorable. We spent another day driving between villages. In Monodendri, we parked in the square and walked for 10 minutes to 15th-century Saint Paraskevi monastery, built into the side of a gorge, where saints stare down from carefully restored frescos.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c09d82e1cdcc940eb487431b1abab905b7e817f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434108969020/aca94441-70de-4272-857f-b6f85d499eaa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The three-arched Plakidas bridge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The three-arched Plakidas bridge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hercules Milas/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The smell of roasting lamb tempted us into family-run Sta Risa taverna in Elati, where we gorged on <em>gigantes</em> – huge beans with spinach and tomato – warm bread, lamb chops, hand-cut fries strewn with thyme, and slow-roast lamb.

I’ll call them the Mystic East, the Dead Centre, and the Wild West. Most people flying to Faro will end up at the popular resort towns of the Dead Centre such as Vilamoura, Albufeira and Lagos, leaving a whole lot of Algarve relatively free of visitors. But if you do fetch up in such a resort, a 20-minute drive will deliver you to some of southern Europe’s most scented, empty countryside.</p> \n<p>Our Mystic East is the borderland. The Guadiana river separates the Algarve – where humility is regarded as a strength – from brasher Spain. Inland, it’s possible to meander for miles through enchanted valleys, hear birdsong, see few people and find peace. The east’s coastal margin is where the ocean is tamed by the sand islands, salt pans and azure lagoons of the Ria Formosa natural park, where flamingos and dolphins abound.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Map of the Algarve area of Portugal\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1434025757299/Travel_Algarve_WEB.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The central Algarve coastline has been relentlessly developed, but even here there are havens of old Portugal with its carob, fig and almond trees, where time treads softly and slowly and life’s pleasures are priced with locals in mind.</p> \n<p>To the Arabs who ruled here for the best part of 900 years, Al Gharb – “The West” – was the end of the world. Go west today and you’ll find wind-brushed cliff paths and superb swimming coves. Turn north at Cabo de S&atilde;o Vicente and there are miles of surf beaches, inland from which white villages huddle amid sheep-nibbled farms and ancient forests.</p> \n<p>With the Gulf of C&aacute;diz and the Atlantic beyond being among Europe’s most fertile marine areas, and a climate where mangoes and bananas thrive, visitors eat extremely well – and surprisingly cheaply – here. The Algarvian kitchen excels at honest, hearty dishes, and the local beers and wines from the region, and neighbouring Alentejo, are world-class and inexpensive.</p> \n<p>In recent years, a few smart visionaries have opened tiny hotels that succeed in being chic yet open-hearted and warm. Visitors staying at one of these will feel cared for – and lucky. So, with 300-plus days of sunshine, abundant budget flights, excellent roads and deep traditions of hospitality and affordability, the only question worth asking is: which Algarve to visit?</p> \n<h2><strong>THE EAST</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"053123bce1f2da9230752ca4922cd3d2316cd04f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434036330003/37dd2d5f-5e11-4bc8-a5ca-ad9d0fa9c709-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Ponte Romana across the Gilao river, Tavira.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ponte Romana across the Gilao river, Tavira.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sabine Lubenow/JAI/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s worth heading inland to pretty Alcoutim for the drive alone. Cistus, wild orchids and house-high castor oil plants fringe the roadside. Alcoutim’s slim, cobbled streets tumble down to this gorgeous bend of the Guadiana with its peace and sandy river beaches. <strong>O Soeiro </strong>restaurant (4 Rua do Munic&iacute;pio, +351 281 546 241) opens out onto the adjoining church steps and riverside. It’s family-style and not fancy. The grilled chicken is heroic.<br /></p> \n<p>The Guadiana meets the sea at Vila Real de Santo Ant&oacute;nio. Elegant, once-wealthy and still popular with Spaniards perusing bargain household textiles, Vila Real is where the ferry chugs across to Ayamonte in Spain. Some 300 metres up the all-but-abandoned quayside from the ferry terminal is <strong>Tasquinha da Muralha</strong> (+351 963 267 265), a blue-and-white shack serving faultless grilled fish.</p> \n<p>Monte Gordo is a 1960s tourist town that need not detain us but, from here, there are beaches all the way to Faro. Praia do Cabe&ccedil;o is popular with clammers but also families and strollers, and runs from Monte Gordo to Manta Rota. The popular (and good) <strong>Sem Espinhas</strong> (+351 281 956 026, <a href=\"http://www.semespinhas.net/praiadocabeco.html\">semespinhas.net</a>) beach hangout will cook you lunch, sell you a lolly and/or get you tipsy.</p> \n<p>Once the home of 12th-century Sufi poets drunk on divine love, Cacela Velha is a jewel-like three-bar, two-restaurant seaside hamlet on a cliff top overlooking market gardens, oyster beds and inviting, strollable sandy islands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbbdf533c4edde610977728ba288b72978af363b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037146930/a46a9db0-49f9-4b32-9f06-0dae8d6a62c6-460x205.jpeg\" alt=\"The beach at Cacela Velha.\" width=\"460\" height=\"205\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beach at Cacela Velha.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Gould</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cabanas de Tavira was once a tuna fishery and is now a slow, low-rise village with the excellent <a href=\"https://pt-pt.facebook.com/noeliaejeronimorestaurante?rf=12992224708658\"><strong>No&eacute;lia e Jer&oacute;nimo</strong></a> (3 Rua da Fortaleza, +351 281 370 649). No&eacute;lia is a seriously good chef who serves updated Portuguese classics such as octopus fritters with coriander rice. Opposite is Cabanas island beach, which is reached by ferry (€1.30) in three minutes. If doing nothing is too much for you, Eolis (<a href=\"http://www.kitesurfeolis.com/\">kitesurfeolis.com</a>) will teach you kitesurfing … and that you’re not as young as you used to be.</p> \n<p>Tavira is slightly the victim of its own elegant loveliness: eating places abound, as do visitors. But its beach is a gem: Ilha da Tavira, only reachable by boat, has shops, cafes and a campsite. Ferries run to here from Tavira town, Cabanas de Tavira and Quatro &Aacute;guas.</p> \n<p>Between Tavira and the island is adorable Santa Luzia. This whitewashed fishing village is Portugal’s “capital of octopus”. Book ahead at <strong>Casa do Polvo Tasquinha</strong> (8 Avenida Engenheiro Duarte Pacheco, +351 281 328 527) for Nicole’s perfect chargrilled octopus. Walk lunch off at <strong>Praia Barril</strong> beach, reached on the vintage train (€1.30 each way) which deposits you at the beach cafe/shop complex. Like many eastern Algarve beaches, Barril is naturist-friendly.</p> \n<p>Still heading west, <strong>Marisqueira Fialho</strong> restaurant (Estr Vale Formoso, +351 281 961 222) is at Pinheiro, a tranquil shallow lagoon where visitors can stroll the marshes among the abundant bird life and soak up the sun on lonely sand bars. Fialho specialises in eel, fish and clam dishes, and much unforced Portuguese cheer.</p> \n<p>Fuzeta is a 1930s fishing/holiday town with another fabulous island beach. Splendid outdoor fish lunches, expertly grilled by Senhor Filipe, are yours for €10 a pop at <strong>A Lota </strong>(next to the fish market, Largo 1 de Maio, +351 289 794 860). An afternoon’s paddle and stroll along Fuzeta beach brings you to Armona and its ferries (<a href=\"http://www.olhao.web.pt/horariobarcos.htm\">olhao.web.pt</a>) to Olh&atilde;o.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b66fb244dc3586691e499d537fdb08006ee2c2cb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037046514/e2d7393d-a1f1-4bd9-940e-8614d282e426-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A chapel in Culatra.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chapel in Culatra.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Gould</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Algarve’s largest commercial port and its extensive clam beds make Olh&atilde;o a busy, living, salty place. Clam digger Alexander cooks (relatively) upscale dishes opposite the thriving, exciting market at <a href=\"https://pt-pt.facebook.com/pages/Sabores-Da-Ria/258474680879347\"><strong>Sabores da Ria</strong></a> (Pra&ccedil;a Patr&atilde;o Joachim Lopes, +351963479472), while <strong>Carlos and Helena</strong> (10 Rua Olhanense, +351 289 702 892) offers Helena’s pitch-perfect family cooking.</p> \n<p>The Ilha da Culatra can be reached by ferry from Olh&atilde;o. There’s sometimes a shack on its beach with drinks and sunloungers; the few folk who come here do so for solitude and its beautiful waters. By the jetty, friendly <strong>Caf&eacute; Janoca </strong>(meals from €15) will overfeed you with pleasure. Culatra is also a destination for <strong>Passeios Ria Formosa </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.passeios-ria-formosa.com/en/\">passeios-ria-formosa.com</a>) which operates tours and water taxis from Olh&atilde;o, Fuzeta, Santa Luzia and Cabanas de Tavira.</p> \n<h2>Where to stay</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60bccb117d0cd1a84629f0cadb8ff7643f10254a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434035732292/acaa85a6-0932-4577-9d33-209b954ac504-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"‘Sexy B&amp;B’ … the stylish Convento riad in Olh&atilde;o\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Sexy B&amp;B’ … the stylish Convento riad in Olh&atilde;o</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>New this year, <strong>Convento</strong> (doubles from €80, 10 Travessa Antonio Bento, +351 911 970 167, <a href=\"http://conventoolhao.com/\">conventoolhao.com</a>) is a serene nine-room riad with a rooftop pool in the heart of Olh&atilde;o’s medina.

Faro is a thriving university town with a pretty centre: find fun and alfresco drinks and snacks at <a href=\"http://www.barcolumbus.pt/\"><strong>Bar Columbus</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Jardim Manuel Bivar).</p> \n<p>The hills behind and beyond Faro offer many a sturdy dinner. In an old dairy in the village of Machados, near S&atilde;o Br&aacute;s de Alportel, <strong>Adega Nunes </strong>(+351 289 842 506) offers home cooking and homemade firewater digestifs. Another happy place to lose an afternoon in is <strong>Lagar da Mesquita</strong> (Mesquita Baixa 315A, +351 289 845 809), a restaurant in an old oil press in the hamlet of Mesquita.</p> \n<p>Paderne is a sweet village nine miles inland from Albufeira with two great restaurants: <a href=\"http://www.restauranteveneza.com/en/\"><strong>Veneza</strong></a><strong> </strong>(560A Estrada de Paderne, +351 289 367 129) with its renowned cellar, and <a href=\"http://restaurantexerem.com/\"><strong>Xer&eacute;m</strong></a> (Estrada Ferreiras,+351 289 543 141), famous for <em>xer&eacute;m</em> – Portugal’s polenta.

After a hard week at work, isn’t that precisely what you want from a weekend away? You need a place to retreat, de-stress and regroup. You need Tudor Farmhouse.</p> \n<p>“Ask people around here if they’re from England or Wales and they’ll say Forest,” said owner Colin Fell, as we motored from Lydney station through the Forest of Dean. This somewhat isolated enclave – above Bristol and the river Severn, almost Wales, not quite the Cotswolds – remains relatively unknown. Outdoorsy types come to get muddy in the Wye Valley, and history buffs love Tintern Abbey and Raglan Castle, but the area lacks the picturesque, ivy-clad villages that would attract day-trippers.</p> \n<p>The village of Clearwell is evidently an exception. Bathed in evening sunlight, it felt like the set of a Richard Curtis film, with its old stone buildings, minimal traffic and strangers saying hello. It is tiny, but there are country walks in every direction, several nooks to explore (a grotto-like well, its Gothic revival castle) and, importantly, two village pubs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ced393023128b124d9b94bc0b7766752c849b1e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434036566927/b6255db6-47c7-48da-96aa-945bcd766f23-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Bedroom at Tudor farmhouse\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Tudor Farmhouse is a collection of 16th-century stone buildings, with a courtyard garden, orchard, allotments and free-range hens. It is a ridiculously pretty spot, but, internally, the rugged character of these handsome buildings is allowed to shine. There are floors so uneven you feel drunk walking on them, ancient winding staircases, huge grates now housing wood-burning stoves, and medieval panelling, doors and beams. Its 20 bedrooms (many were refurbished over the winter) are restrained in their neat greige decor. Throughout, there is a pleasing lack of clutter and cottagey cuteness.<br /></p> \n<p>My entry-level “hatchling” room (all are named after chicken sizes, except the suites) was compact but smooth-functioning – tiny niggles aside (slightly fiddly Velux window, small wine crates for bedside tables). The space has been used intelligently and has everything you need, from a full-length mirror to homemade shortbread. The detail (wooden hangers, duckdown pillows, fresh milk) was sound. I liked the clear TV instructions and the one-click Wi-Fi. It all just worked. The staff were, likewise, warm but well-drilled.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ed477282c8babd7164685c45b67d5af4dd603cd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434036630592/ca18579c-ab02-4c79-8a57-18a67bd4e661-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Restaurant at Tudor\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The hotel’s restaurant is the final redoubt, a cocoon of tea lights, exposed stone and leaded windows. After an aperitif of white wine from a <a href=\"http://www.parvafarm.com/\">vineyard in nearby Tintern Parva </a>(spritzy and enjoyable) or a beer from local Hillside Brewery (excellent), real life will seem very remote.</p> \n<p>There was the odd fault, most notably an over-reduced meat jus that was more like glue, but generally chef Martin Adams’s food is technically adept and his flavours ring true. His dish design needs greater discipline, however. White chocolate was an interesting garnish for mackerel (like salted chocolate), but jarred with the accompanying pickled beetroot. The dish didn’t need both. Likewise, in its individual components, a main course of calf’s liver and 72-day aged brisket was impressive but, texturally, the two meats were not complementary. It felt like I had two competing, if tasty, dishes on the same plate.</p> \n<p>Well-fed nonetheless, I toddled off to bed and fell asleep to a soundtrack of bleating lambs. Next morning, after breakfast (a quality spread), it was back to grim reality, joining the commuters at Lydney station.

Lots and lots of emails. On paper I was organising the movement of chemicals around the world, but in reality I was just at my desk sending emails. I’m going to be honest: I hated it.</p> \n<p>My degree was in <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_engineering\">chemical engineering</a>, and after I finished I was keen to move to London. I decided to go into trading – buying and selling chemicals.</p> \n<p>I lasted there for about three years. The nature of trading is that you don’t hear back about a job unless it’s gone wrong. Then you get a phone call with someone screaming at you. It’s a lot of pressure for something that you don’t care about in the grand scheme of life.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, two of my best friends, Will and Andy, from back home in Nottingham, were talking about turning their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrewing\">homebrewing</a> hobby into a business. Nottingham is well known for its beer and when we were younger we spent a lot of time going to beer festivals, visiting breweries and drinking a lot of beer. We even made the jump to brewing our own using homebrew kits. I told them I wanted to leave my job and managed to elbow my way into their scheme to open a brewery.</p> \n<p>Quitting my job was the biggest sense of relief I’ve ever felt in my life. Even though I was worrying about how I was going to make money, it was amazing not to be kept awake at night worrying about a tank stuck in China. I had gone back to zero, starting anew, but this time with a bit of knowledge and experience. I took a part-time bar job and did session singing to pay the bills.</p> \n<p>We started with absolutely no money. We put our first batch of beer – our ruby ale – in other breweries’ bottles, and I drove the van to bars and restaurants trying to sell it. We got enough orders to justify doing a whole batch as cuckoo brewers – borrowing other people’s equipment. The first batch was 20 casks, around 1,000 bottles, and we stayed up late hand-tying our labels to every single one.</p> \n<p>Our original plan was to build a nano-brewing kit in a basement under a pub in Walthamstow and be a small brewery. But it quickly became apparent that we were getting too many orders and would need to find a bigger place.</p> \n<p>We applied for a loan from the <a href=\"http://www.thebrightsidetrust.org/\">Brightside Trust</a>, and also did a call-out on Twitter to raise money, tweeting: “Do you want to invest in a local business?” People had spotted us in the area and drunk our beer, and they lent us bits and bobs. They got loan terms and an awful lot of free beer.</p> \n<p>I’m now head brewer of <a href=\"http://www.wildcardbrewery.co.uk/\">Wild Card Brewery</a>, and we have a home on an industrial estate in Walthamstow village. I would say it’s changed me. Being involved in a start up means you have to adapt. If something needs doing, you do it. I get to work at about 7am and the first thing I do is go to the speakers and turn my playlist up ridiculously loud. My life is completely different now. There aren’t a lot of women in engineering and there also aren’t a lot of women in beer, so it has that in common.</p> \n<p>The difference is this is a hell of a lot more fun. In what other industry would you attend a serious business meeting and get a funny look if you don’t have a pint in your hand?<br /><em>As told to Becky Barnicoat</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3020ceba9037fac16c38a7b62c3e6d33295d94b6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432653337354/8daa9021-0aaa-4bcb-81f5-e594f67685a6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Gary Stocker, who have up his previous life to become a human cannonball.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gary Stocker, who have up his previous life to become a human cannonball.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>From lawyer to human cannonball<br /><strong>Gary Stocker, 32</strong></h2> \n<p>Magic was my favourite hobby as a child. I’d regularly visit Covent Garden with my dad to watch the street performers. When I was 15, I plucked up the courage to perform there – a 40-minute magic show I had developed myself.</p> \n<p>I loved performing but I’d always been good academically, and when I was offered a place at Oxford to read law, I took it. Afterwards, I tried to keep the magic going, but all my university friends were heading off for careers in the city, and street entertaining doesn’t pay well.</p> \n<p>Ten years later, I was a lawyer, with a six-figure salary and a house in Waterloo complete with swimming pool. I could easily have continued on that comfortable path if an old friend from Sweden hadn’t called. We’d known each other as street performers and he’d recently won Sweden’s Got Talent and been given his own television show. He wanted to use some of my old material, including a cannonball stunt I’d always dreamed of performing in public. When I said yes, it felt like I was handing him the remnants of my dream.</p> \n<p>We agreed that any props he built using my ideas would be mine to keep, which is how I came to be a lawyer with a cannon. Then another friend got in touch to say he was starting a circus and would I be part of it? My human cannonball could be the finale in the show. When I told colleagues my plan, they thought I was having an early mid-life crisis and that I’d be back at my desk in weeks.</p> \n<p>,I started practising the trick in the grounds of my house, using the swimming pool as a soft landing, testing the elasticity of the cannon mechanism and gradually building up my confidence.</p> \n<p>Today, I am the human cannonball at <a href=\"http://www.chaplinscircus.com\">Chaplin’s</a>, a circus-themed show. It took a lot of money to get the circus off the ground, and we employ and house about 25 people full-time, so initially the stakes were high. But the elation I felt the first time I performed the stunt in public was incredible.</p> \n<p>You can sense huge anticipation in the audience when the cannon is wheeled on. Meanwhile, I’m waiting in the barrel, tensely going through a mental checklist of safety measures – has the firing mechanism been pulled back enough? Is any of the metalwork bent out of shape? Then suddenly I’m flying though the air and everything’s in slow motion until I hit the net, when I’m overwhelmed for a moment by a sense of invincibility, even though I know that no matter how much care I take, every flight could be my last.</p> \n<p>I’ve always been driven by the need to feel free, and waking up somewhere new every few weeks gives me that. We perform nine shows a week and I work longer hours than I ever did in the City. But every week we pitch up on grounds that had tents just like ours 200 years ago. I love being part of that tradition. <br /><em>As told to</em> <em>Chris Broughton</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8381dd109bfdada4c2ac4c6f0582cd8014ffff3c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432653564652/4c075c81-cde8-4730-a866-c88ad0523ff8-280x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jessie Tuckman, who gave up her previous life to become a surfer.\" width=\"280\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessie Tuckman, who gave up her previous life to become a surfer.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Molly Johnson for The Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>From loans officer to surfer<br /><strong>Jessie Tuckman, 26</strong></h2> \n<p>I left school at 16 with mostly A grades and my parents expected me to go to college, but I wanted to start earning. I took a job at a call centre and they trained me up as a loans officer. At first I enjoyed it; I was earning enough my firstanto buy my first apartment when I was 18. But when the financial crisis hit the industry became gloomier and I started to wonder if there might be something else.</p> \n<p>One weekend my cousin invited me to go surfing in <a href=\"https://www.scarboroughsurfschool.co.uk\">Scarborough</a>. It was freezing cold and windy – nothing like the vision in my mind of blue skies and white sand. The water was brown and my wetsuit was too small. I didn’t even manage to stand up on the board – I just clung to it as I hurtled towards the shore. But it was a great feeling. I was 20 and had never surfed before, but after that day I couldn’t stop thinking about it.</p> \n<p>Surfing made my office job feel boring. I joined a surf club and went on trips every weekend. I stuck a photo of a wave above my desk and my bosses joked they were going to lose me to surfing – which they did. At 22, I quit my job and, with &pound;150 in my account and no job or accommodation lined up, moved to <a href=\"http://www.newquay.co.uk\">Newquay</a>. I got a bed in a bunk room above a pub. The window didn’t close, but it only cost &pound;60 a week including breakfast.</p> \n<p>All I had were my clothes, my guitar and my surfboard. I thought: “What else do I need?”</p> \n<p>That first winter was tough. I earned &pound;65 a week in a nightclub and lived on noodles and bread and butter. The town was cold and quiet, and I felt lonely – I’d left behind all my home comforts and my friends. But by the summer the atmosphere changed – everyone seemed happy and spent more and more time outdoors.</p> \n<p>That was three years ago; now I call Newquay home. I work as a cleaner in a pizza restaurant on Fistral beach for two and a half hours every morning. Then I rush to the surf club, get into my gear and I’m in the sea. I spend four to six hours a day surfing, six days a week; I’m in the open air and I’m healthier. I’ve got sponsors behind me and my coach is an ex-British champion. Last year I finished 13th, which is pretty good for someone who didn’t touch a surfboard until they were 20.</p> \n<p>I still don’t earn much. Some weeks my fiance and I only have &pound;40 to spend on food, but we survive. The locals thought I was mad when I moved here. They couldn’t believe I would leave behind a stable job and good income. But even though I’d had the money, I didn’t have my freedom – or the beach, which is my favourite thing in the world.<em> BB</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a99bbccd244921744b1b64a023bd9703c78495a0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432653891941/ded30e6a-9335-403a-a2e3-cb203d0375fa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ian Usher, who gave up his job as a Pharmacy manager to become a desert islander.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Usher, who gave up his job as a Pharmacy manager to become a desert islander.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Solo Syndication</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>From pharmacy manager to desert islander<br /><strong>Ian Usher, 51</strong></h2> \n<p>It was the breakup of my marriage that forced me to re-evaluate my life. I’d moved from the UK to Australia with my wife, had a job managing a pharmacy and built our own home. After we separated, I wanted to cut my ties with the past. I sold everything except a few clothes. At 45 I was suddenly free – no ties, no home, and all the money from the sale.</p> \n<p>My dad had died at 61, leaving his plans for retirement unfulfilled, which gave me a sense of urgency. I decided I wanted to settle somewhere tropical, and discovered Panama through an internet search. I contacted an estate agent and the last place he showed me was an island – part of the archipelago of <a href=\"http://www.bocasdeltoro.com\">Bocas del Toro </a>in the Caribbean Sea northwest of Panama. It was two acres of overgrown jungle, roughly circular, and about 100 yards across. I made what I thought was a stupid offer and, unexpectedly, the owner said: “Give me a couple of thousand more and it’s yours.” How could I resist?</p> \n<p>A little under &pound;18,000 changed hands and the deed was done – I owned a tropical island.</p> \n<p>Even though I’d barely seen what I was buying, I knew it had the makings of paradise, though it took another two years to reach that point. When I arrived, you could just about battle your way round the edge with a machete, but it was impossible to get to the middle. With the help of locals I cleared the land and built a house, complete with solar panels, electrics and a water system.</p> \n<p>For the first couple of years I was mostly alone on my island – I’ve always been happy in my own company. There was a lively pizza restaurant on a nearby island if I wanted a chat. Then, on a visit to London, I met Vanessa, who had recently divorced and wanted to start a new life. She shared my love of adventure and asked me questions about the island. “Come and visit,” I said. She did – and within a fortnight, she’d resigned from her job and arranged for her possessions to be sold.</p> \n<p>At first, we felt like we’d achieved the perfect life – sunny days skimming across the water in our little boat watching dolphins, snorkelling in clear water through shoals of fish. We were living on fresh seafood, bananas, pineapples, coconuts and eggs from the chickens that roamed freely across the island.</p> \n<p>But after a year, we realised we couldn’t spend the rest of our lives in a hammock sipping margaritas. We started to ask: “What’s next?”</p> \n<p>So now we’re on to a new chapter, working as language teachers in China and the island is back on the market. Everything I’ve done seems incredible, but when I look back on it, I can’t help thinking: “Well, that was easy.” <em>CB</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"199b91cd832c825dedb891df3c3657f394352530\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432654063167/38138abe-c066-44bd-b7e8-122afd4700ce-334x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Zan Kaufman, who gave up her former career in New York as a corporate lawyer to run her burger takeaway company \" bleecker=\"\" st.\".\"=\"\" width=\"334\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Zan Kaufman, who gave up her former career in New York as a corporate lawyer to run her burger takeaway company “Bleecker St.”.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>From litigation lawyer to burger seller<br /><strong>Zan Kaufman, 35</strong></h2> \n<p>Ten years ago, I was working as a corporate lawyer in New York City. My father had been a lawyer and it was what I’d always seen myself doing. I imagined living in the city, earning a big salary. What I didn’t imagine was the reality: it was stressful, with long hours and a strict hierarchy.</p> \n<p>In 2011, I offered to help in my friend’s family burger restaurant on Sundays to break up the monotony of my day job. I thought I’d be their bartender. I wasn’t much of a cook and I’d never cared for burgers – I usually found them disappointing. But the burgers there were amazing – the perfect bun and meat combination, like some kind of magic. I knew then what I wanted to do for a living.</p> \n<p>Two weeks later I quit my job and began working in the restaurant full-time. It seems extreme, but I was moving to London the following year anyway to marry my girlfriend, and I knew this job could travel. Looking back, it should have been daunting – financially, it’s difficult to get a restaurant off the ground. But I think my passion overcame my fear.</p> \n<p>In the end I couldn’t get funding for a restaurant, but I had enough money to buy a truck, so <a href=\"http://bleeckerburger.co.uk\">Bleecker St. Burger</a> launched in London in the summer of 2012. I had to hustle constantly for pitches and for custom, but I fell in love with trading on the streets. It’s instant gratification – everyone tells you what they think of your food and you’re face to face with your customers rather than hidden behind a wall of waiters and a kitchen.</p> \n<p>I didn’t know many people when I arrived in the UK and a lot of my customers have become good friends. Plus there are the other traders – it’s an amazing community.</p> \n<p>We’ve now opened a permanent kiosk in Spitalfields Market, but I’m still tied to the streets and we pitch up there in the summer.</p> \n<p>Looking back at everything that’s happened is surreal. There are sacrifices – I have very little separation between work and home life, and my wife and I have had to postpone our plans for a baby.</p> \n<p>But I get real perspective when I take my truck to trade outside the Gherkin in the city.
