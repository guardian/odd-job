Good news for independent travellers looking for unspoilt gems, because this far south-western corner of Andaluc&iacute;a, between C&aacute;diz and Portugal, has many, and not least along its 75-mile coastline, part of the Costa de la Luz, or the Coast of Light.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Huelva map\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1435320844789/TRAVEL_Huelva-web-.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n</figure> \n<p>To the east, the coastal area is dominated by <a href=\"http://www.andalucia.com/environment/protect/donana.htm\"><strong>Do&ntilde;ana</strong></a>, the largest and wildest of several protected marshlands, and a great long stretch of virgin beach backed by high dunes. And to the west, after the over-optimistic coastal developments of Isla Canela, there’s a string of chilled-out, small seaside resorts and fishing villages where life is easy, exceptional seafood is as cheap as chips, and people dance barefoot in beach bars on wide stretches of sand until the early hours.</p> \n<p>With the coastal <a href=\"http://www.andalucia.com/cities/huelva.htm\"><strong>city of Huelva</strong></a> equidistant between Faro and Seville airports (one-and-a-half hours away), access couldn’t be easier.

One of the most important and biodiverse protected areas in Europe, Do&ntilde;ana is home to the Iberian lynx (which you won’t see) and a favoured spot for waterfowl (which you will). The waters are packed with avocets, spoonbills, greylag geese, herons, flamingos, and various endangered ducks, although in high summer, much of the water disappears – as do many of the birds. Arranging a visit can be baffling. Only one company is authorised to drive visitors into the national park, and that’s <strong>Cooperativa Marismas del Roc&iacute;o</strong>, which offers a four-hour bus trip (+34 959 430 432, no website, <em>€</em>29.50pp).

There are three visitor centres signposted off the A483 from Matalasca&ntilde;as to El Roc&iacute;o, from which to get information about short walking trails. <strong>El Acebuche</strong> is officially the main centre, but twitchers may prefer the trail from <strong>La Rocina</strong> which follows the course of a stream.</p> \n<p><strong>El Roc&iacute;o</strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"8395070ffd167dc96db30d32712b0169c8d20ca7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435323464349/0acc51fa-546f-4eb0-a90e-71a0fd577778-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"El Rocio, view to Ermita del Rocio\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">El Roc&iacute;o.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images/Westend61</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Few places are as pleasantly weird as <a href=\"http://www.andalucia.com/province/huelva/rocio/home.htm\">El Roc&iacute;o</a> in mid-afternoon – you’ll think you’ve stumbled across the filmset of a western. Literally a backwater on the edge of the Do&ntilde;ana marshes, its wide streets are made of drifting sand, low-flying flamingos cross the plazas, people get around on horseback, every house has a hitching post, and the few shops sell flamenco dresses, Catholic trinkets, or riding boots. Once a year, at Pentecost in May, 1 million all-singing, all-dancing pilgrims converge in wagons and on horses to pay homage to the sparkling statue of Our Lady of El Roc&iacute;o, Queen of the Marsh – an event that’s only for the most nocturnal and devout of partygoers.</p> \n<p><strong>Ruta Brit&aacute;nica, Huelva</strong><br />When an earthquake struck Lisbon in 1755, Huelva city, which sits on marshland, wobbled like jelly and collapsed, so there’s little evidence of its long history as an Atlantic trading post. But this self-guided tour celebrates the peculiarities of its recent past. The British came to set up the Rio Tinto Mining Company in 1873, took copper and left suburbia, private clubs, Victorian bathrooms, library books and a steam railway, as well as a local passion for billiards, badminton, and golf and, most importantly, the very first football club in Spain (unfortunately, Huelva is currently on a losing streak). The colony lasted 81 years, finally dispersed by Franco in 1954. Huelva Experiences runs a tour of the route, which includes the anachronistically suburban <strong>Barrio Reina Victoria</strong>, a dock and station constructed by the Rio Tinto company, and, as an add-on, the tomb of William Martin AKA Glyndwr Michael, The Man Who Never Was, whose body – along with documents detailing fake invasions of Greece and Sardinia – washed ashore here during the Second World War for the attention of German spies as part of Operation Mincemeat.<br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Puerta del Atl&aacute;ntico Visitor Centre, +34 959 541 817, </em><a href=\"http://www.huelva.es/turismo/index.php?lang=en\"><em>huelva.es/turismo</em></a><em>; Huelva Experiences, +34 687 243 802, </em><a href=\"http://huelvaexperiences.com/rutas/colombina.aspx\"><em>huelvaexperiences.com</em></a><em>, adult €40, children €20, under-fours free</em></p> \n<p><strong>In the footsteps of Christopher Columbus</strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"37005f89ed38d8299a8c562354d0730473970de5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435323902250/03c9768a-f91c-4749-aad6-51373c39b921-460x318.jpeg\" alt=\"Replicas of ships Columbus sailed to the Americas in at in La R&aacute;bida.\" width=\"460\" height=\"318\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Replicas of ships Columbus sailed to the Americas in at in La R&aacute;bida.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If it weren’t for the good people of Huelva, Columbus may never have reached the new world – his boats, sailors and funding were all procured from an 8-mile stretch along the steamy, sleepy Rio Tinto.</p> \n<p>The untouristy <strong>Ruta Colombina </strong>takes you to <strong>Moguer</strong> where, behind the blinding white walls of the medieval <strong>Santa Clara Monastery</strong>, Columbus talked the Abbess into persuading her nephew, King Ferdinand, to back his madcap venture. The tours of this well-preserved place are fascinating (especially of note are the translucent alabaster windows and the massive great storks’ nests on top).</p> \n<p>In <strong>Palos de la Frontera</strong>, 15 minutes’ drive south, there’s a collection of bits and bobs and a short docudrama about Columbus in what remains of <strong>the house of Mart&iacute;n Alonso Pinz&oacute;n</strong>, the influential, wealthy mariner who, with his two brothers, joined the explorer on that first voyage in 1492. At the <strong>Iglesia de San Jorge </strong>round the corner, you can stand in the very spot the royal order was read out to unenthusiastic villagers, explaining they were to set sail with this Col&oacute;n (Columbus) character to “certain parts of the ocean”. <strong>The Fontanilla</strong>, the old fountain at which the ships’ barrels were filled, is nearby but not the navigable river as its course was shifted in the Lisbon earthquake. So the excellent replicas of the three <em>caravales</em> that made the voyage – the Ni&ntilde;a, the Pinta and the Santa Mar&iacute;a – sit at a purpose-built dock, a little further south again in <strong>La R&aacute;bida</strong>, below the monastery that accommodated Columbus from 1491-1492 while he waited for his funds. <br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Moguer Tourist Office, +34 959 371 898.

All Huelva’s bounty is on display from Jabugo hams and Condado de Huelva wine, and locally caught and canned fish in arty tins on fruit-crate shelves. It’s a sweet spot, popular in the evenings.

The boat’s big enough to take cars, but this international experience is laid-back and stress-free.

From the “car park” at <strong>Cuesta Maneli</strong>, a wooden walkway of almost a mile leads up and over the lofty <strong>Duna del Asperillo</strong>, ending at the virgin beach, <strong>Playa de Castilla</strong>. Further east, towards Matalasca&ntilde;as, there’s a sign for the <strong>Laguna del Jaral </strong>trail. Here the trip to the beach and back is sufficiently long (3&frac12; miles) and adventurous (some hauling on a rope is required to get up and down the the sandy cliff) to put some people off hence a higher chance of splendid isolation. A third option is to head east from built-up Matalasca&ntilde;as into the protected beaches of the Do&ntilde;ana national park. <strong>The Beach Trail </strong>runs for 20 miles, ending on the banks of the Guadalquivir, opposite the fish restaurants of <strong>Sanl&uacute;car de Barrameda</strong>.</p> \n<p>For boat trips, there are few regions where it’s easier – or cheaper – to test the ocean waves, and there are innumerable operators up and down the coast. After watching boats slipping in and out of the marina at <strong>Mazag&oacute;n</strong>, you’ll want to be on one. The <a href=\"http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=es&amp;u=http://www.rutasenbarcomazagon.es/&amp;prev=search\">Rutas en Barco Mazag&oacute;n</a> (+34 667 351 552, €25pp) runs dolphin-spotting, river estuary trips and voyages into Do&ntilde;ana. At the adventurous end of the spectrum, Huelva’s wide beaches are increasingly popular with kitesurfers. Centres in Isla Canela, Isla Cristina and El Portil offer kit rental, full courses and four-hour beginner sessions. Operators include <a href=\"http://www.islacanelakite.com/\">Isla Canela Kite el Paradise</a> (+34 646 280 860) or <a href=\"http://flechaextreme.com/\">Flecha Extreme</a> (+34 617 000 546) in El Portil, which also offers stand-up paddleboarding and kayaking.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9ed13248b4f345f05496a051a229e0fc11bc093\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435324822499/543ccb22-f5e0-403d-83e3-f6baee5c710d-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Duna del Asperillo\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Duna del Asperillo.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you find the prospect of stumbling across nudists alarming, remain alert at all times when approaching the following areas (from west to east): <strong>Playa Flecha de Nueva Umbr&iacute;a</strong>, just south of Lepe (a mile or so beyond the village of Casas del Terr&oacute;n); <strong>Playa de la Mata Negra</strong>, just west of Punta Umbr&iacute;a where the Odiel Marshes meet the sea in a mass of pines, junipers and dunes; the 3-mile stretch between the Mazag&oacute;n parador and the photogenic Torre del Loro; and <strong>Playa del Asperillo </strong>and<strong> Playa de Castilla</strong>, both accessed from Cuesta Maneli on the road to Matalasca&ntilde;as. All have designated nudist beach areas, although “textiles” – clothes wearers – are welcome.</p> \n<p>An easy and jolly choice, <strong>Isla Cristina</strong>, wedged between marsh and sea, offers cream sand, lifeguards, a promenade, easy parking, a frontline of palms, small white hotels, bars, and restaurants serving cold beer, fresh sardines and <em>arroz marinero</em>. There are a selection of playas to suit everyone, from the family-friendly <strong>Playa del Carmen</strong> to <strong>La Redondela</strong> to the east, where you can abandon your car beside the wooden <em>chiringuito</em> (small bar) and follow the “chameleon route” through pine groves to find your own space in the dunes.</p> \n<p>Just west of Huelva, the river Piedras runs parallel to the coast, creating an 8-mile sandy spit, <strong>la Flecha del Rompido</strong>, and the beaches from El Rompido to El Portil are tucked behind it. So, emerging through the pines at Playa Nuevo Portil, you find yourself on one paradisiacal beach facing another, beyond which is a third and the Atlantic ocean. Small boats ferry people over the calm turquoise channel from three points along the length of la Flecha (€3 return). The sandbar is a protected area and utterly devoid of infrastructure, while <strong>Nuevo Portil </strong>benefits from a smattering of chiringuitos, among them Roman Chavez Mar&iacute;n’s friendly and chic KM6 (open 15 June-15 September), built from a shipping container, pallets and fruit boxes and shaded by sails. Come here for fresh fish at lunchtime, and for beach parties after dark.<br /></p> \n<h2>Where to eat<br /></h2> \n<p><strong>Ac&aacute;nthum, Huelva</strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b9827a3d9d2a53d78857a31b3e9291223625faf7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435325081723/66d789d2-7b72-4142-867b-4e879f449a69-460x329.jpeg\" alt=\"Ac&aacute;nthum, Huelva Coast, Spain\" width=\"460\" height=\"329\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ac&aacute;nthum, Huelva Coast, Spain</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Visit almost any restaurant along Huelva’s Costa de la Luz and you’ll find the same choice, which is fine because the fried every-type-of fish, seafood risotto, and jam&oacute;n from the sierras is universally excellent. Nevertheless, a new breed of young chefs in the city of Huelva have taken the level of sophistication, innovation, and creativity of local fare to a higher plane. Most notable is Xanty El&iacute;as, whose restaurant, Ac&aacute;nthum, was the first in the province to be awarded a “sol” in Spain’s prestigious Repsol Guide. El&iacute;as spent two years at three Michelin-starred Arzak in San Sebasti&aacute;n, and it shows: not just oysters, but oyster with <em>chicharrones</em> (fried pork rinds) and an apple infusion; not just ham, but ham hock tartar and mustard ice-cream, and so on.

Run by the third generation of a local family, this atmospheric restaurant looks more like 500 years old than 60 with its thick white walls, barrels, dark corners and hunting trophies.

Most people ignore the formal restaurant and cram into the patio, which is neon-lit and decorated with yokes, hoes, partridge cages, and things that look suspiciously like snares. What with that and europop on the radio, it may seem an inauspicious choice in this historic town, but the translucent ham (sliced from a leg dangling over the bar), the tongue-tingling ewe’s cheese, the piping-hot fried fish and spicy, oily patatas bravas can’t be bettered. A plus for ditherers is the check-box menu – a list of items available in €2,€3 or €4 portions, and set menus with wine from €11.50. <br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Calle Fuentes 60, +34 959 371 281, </em><em><a href=\"http://bodeguitadelosraposo.es/\">bodeguitadelosraposo.es</a></em></p> \n<p><strong>Restaurante Toru&ntilde;o, El Roc&iacute;o<br /></strong>To get a handle on the strange world that is the marshy outpost of El Roc&iacute;o and a good choice of <em>cocina onubense</em> (Huelva cooking), eat here.

Outside, in the shade of a 1,000-year-old olive tree, everyone appears to be related and inebriated, and waiters are serving drinks to well-turned out riders on well-turned out horses. The food is hearty, a perfect blend of local hunting, shooting, farming (partridge pat&eacute;, venison, duck and pork) and fishing (prawns, sole and “various wild fish”), the Atlantic being just down the road. Ornithologists in particular will appreciate the tooting and murmured quark-quark serenade of waterfowl sploshing through the adjacent marsh.<br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Plaza del Acebuchal 22, +34 959 442 323</em></p> \n<h2>Places to stay</h2> \n<p><strong>Mazagonia Hotel, Mazag&oacute;n</strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a8eb6eecb0f8224af48c3bd471815e3df208093b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435325668656/a5f2ee6e-b575-4e5b-920d-2f7b1e84c8e4-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hotel Mazagonia, Huelva Coast, Spain\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>There are views of an ocean liner in an urban oasis of pine and flowers at this cool boutique hotel.

Selected by Thomson, Melia also actively attracts independent travellers with bargain offers. <br /><em><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Doubles from €75 all inclusive,</em><br /><em>+34 959 621 000, </em><a href=\"http://www.melia.com/\"><em>melia.com</em></a><em>, open 1 May to end of October</em></p> \n<p><strong>Hotel Toru&ntilde;o, El Roc&iacute;o </strong><br />A cheery, relaxed hotel with comfy leather sofas, books, art, help-yourself homemade wine in the lobby and a very good restaurant next door.

Covering ecology, environment, agriculture and industry, it is full of futuristic, interactive stands and snack bars, but admission is horribly over-priced at €22.</p> \n<p>Still, it has brought attention to Marghera itself, a leafy mainland suburb of La Serenissima that houses a tight-knit community of Venetians who left the island part of the city because of soaring rents. Most residents commute each day to work in Venice’s restaurants, bars and hotels. Marghera is more genuinely Venetian than Venice itself, but without a tourist in sight, and it is worth a day trip for those who want a change from the famous sights.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7ef68d1767bfdd0f5084ac2247c56394a02e89a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435317802480/4b79236a-8440-4d8d-9d24-1ba8b89f0ed0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Fresh produce at Marghera market.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fresh produce at Marghera market</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The bus arrives at Piazza Mercato, a wide tree-lined boulevard which is crammed with stalls of the daily food market.

It only entailed a short train journey to Tigre, and a 40-minute boat ride (about &pound;8).</p> \n<p>Each year, on my return to Argentina with my family, I still head here.

The alfesco setting enhances the eating experience (there’s no interior just a small grocer shop) and we arrive hungry.

The only sound that might break the tranquillity is the distant chug of a boat or the hiss of the <em>cigarras</em> (crickets).

Inside this huge wooden drum, dashing black-clad chaps on motorbikes go full throttle so they can cling to its vertical walls. “Look!” shouts the spieler, “side-saddle riding with no hands!”</p> \n<p>At the height of its popularity in the 1960s, when it attracted more than two million thrill-seekers a year, Dreamland boasted a wall of death run by legendary stunt motorcyclist Yvonne Stagg. I never knew it firsthand, only through Lindsay Anderson’s unsettling 1953 documentary film, O Dreamland, with its terrifying animatronic electric chair and Haunted Snail ride.</p> \n<p>The park closed, seemingly forever, in 2003, but here it is, a candy-striped phoenix, saved from being turned over to featureless residential properties by the indomitable energies of The Dreamland Trust, aided by a dramatic CPO by Thanet District Council and, now, private backing. The Grade II-listed scenic railway, devastated by an arson attack in 2008, has been rebuilt, wooden slat by wooden slat, back to its rickety, grinding glory. Though sadly, the restoration wasn’t finished quite in time for opening last weekend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84c3d2ca05ce7b092f2ec2ce7701f94da457ae6c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063380541/d31ef1a5-f277-46f4-8a8b-89899099d2ec-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Messhams Wall of Death\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Defying gravity … Messhams Wall of Death provides traditional thrills</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On my first visit, I go along with Rob Ball, a photographer who has created a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/gallery/2015/jun/08/margate-dreamland-amusement-park-tintype-photographs-in-pictures\">series of haunting, tintype photographs of the park during its transition</a>. He knew it in the late 1990s when it was “more like a travelling fair, everything seemed temporary and a bit broken. It was like Margate at the time – lacking any kind of energy”.</p> \n<p>Energy it now has in spades. The staff, in their vintage Levi’s 501s, denim overalls and jaunty 1950s-style bandanas – are bursting with sugar-rush enthusiasm. Their T-shirts bellow fairground-speak: “Scream if you want to go faster”, “Hands in the air”, “We cater for pleasure”, a riff on the original strapline, Pleasure Without Measure. My first teenage, um, stirrings took place on the waltzers, and I’m delighted to see that the long-haired, tattooed ride-wrangler aesthetic is still in place, even if it’s softened by the seaside rock palette. More than 200 new jobs have been created, mostly for locals: Dreamland is already contributing significantly to Margate’s steady revival.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457255339__\n</div> \n<p>One entrance is via the imposing, brick-fronted building, off the seafront parade of arcades and pubs and the striking, fin-fronted art deco cinema. This brings you past The Emporium, bristling with superior souvenirs, many designed by local artists, such as <a href=\"http://www.zoemurphy.com/\">Zoe Murphy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.keithbrymerjones.com/537/about-keith-brymer-jones\">Keith Brymer Jones</a>. There’s also retro furniture from <a href=\"http://junkdeluxe.co.uk/\">Junk Deluxe</a>, including decorative items crafted from pieces of the original scenic railway. You’re immediately in the heart of the hubbub: a glorious tin-tiled ceiling left in decoratively peeling state soars over roller-disco, bar, acres of neon – including a wonderful artwork by Ramsgate-based artist <a href=\"http://www.rachelwilberforce.com/\">Rachel Wilberforce</a> – and banks of original pinball machines. You can also go in via an entrance under the rollercoaster – I can only imagine how exciting this will be when the cars are rumbling above your head.</p> \n<p>Once, Dreamland was at the cutting edge of fairground excitement. But now it has a whole other agenda: rather than competing with the high-tech thrills of Alton Towers and Thorpe Park, it offers a gentle, sweetly retro vision of seaside fun masterminded by designer <a href=\"http://houseofhemingway.co.uk/hemingway-design/projects/dreamland/\">Wayne Hemingway</a>. Old rides have been refurbished, old fairground paraphernalia upcycled. But your hair will still be raised: 17 rides are currently open, more than enough for a day out, ranging from the vintage galloper merry-go-round, its handsome, brightly painted steeds performing a stately dance, to the hectic, waltzer-meets-rollercoaster swoops of the Crazy Mouse which has us screaming like hopped-up teenagers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62b7a4aa9c2815cc1480c513269787db2954a0a6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063878076/583de9ec-a223-453c-815f-0e2b6c5592bc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dreamland helter-skelter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dreamland is not aiming to compete with the likes of hi-tech Thorpe Park and Alton Towers</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Design is a huge part of it: you don’t need to notice that the teacups ride has been painted by a Wedgewood artist in classic Jasperware style – but with cultural icons from mods and rockers to new romantics. Or that the original dodgems have been repainted with David Bowie and Chuck Berry. But if you do, it adds an extra layer of pleasure.</p> \n<p>It costs &pound;14.95 for a pre-booked daily ticket (&pound;17.95 on the day), a price that has caused some local chuntering. My friend Jane remembers hanging out there every Saturday evening when entry was free, you only had to pay for rides. “As a 14-year-old, it was the only place to go – in all senses.” But I think the pricing is fair: your daily wristband allows you to go in and out as you please. So you can take time out for art at the <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/\">Turner Contemporary</a>, or to mooch round the indie shops of the Old Town – some of which, like vintage clothes specialist <a href=\"http://www.madampopoff.com/\">Madam Popoff</a>, are capitalising on Dreamland’s arrival by offering discounts to customers with wristbands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2df334c18f549fc16caffb44b929407f6659e02\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435064170608/0a93940f-fbef-49d1-8c28-3ed971d8d22d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The careful restoration of old arcade games has been part of Dreamland's redevelopment.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The careful restoration of old arcade games has been part of Dreamland’s redevelopment.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Stothard/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The one element that’s not floating my swing boat is the food. The food court looks attractive, fringed by herb-filled planters made from more reclaimed rollercoaster. But the only local presences I detect are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yamasmargate?fref=nf\">Yama’s Thai</a> (closed during our visit) and <a href=\"http://propercoffeehouse.co.uk/\">Proper Coffee</a>. Despite being served from a gleaming Airstream caravan, my cheeseburger is last century in a bad way: greasy, a stranger to quality meat products, topped with sweaty cheese. At &pound;4.50, it’s not cheap – and it nearly makes a second appearance after one too many turns on the dizzying Chair-O-Planes. I’m not sure, either, why the (expensive) ice-cream concession is by the Cotswold-based <a href=\"http://www.marshfield-icecream.co.uk/\">Marshfield Farm</a> when there’s the likes of <a href=\"http://www.morellisgelato.com/heritage\">Morelli’s</a>, which was founded in Broadstairs, nearby. So on my second visit, I use my wristband to trot out to newly opened <a href=\"http://www.hantverk-found.co.uk/\">Hantverk &amp; Found</a> (18 King St), a tiny seafood cafe and gallery, for gorgeous local seafood dishes and a clever winelist. It’s great to see outside tables at <a href=\"http://greatbritishpizza.com/margate-contact-us/\">GB Pizza</a> (14A Marine Drive) and <a href=\"http://bebeached.co.uk/\">BeBeached</a> (Harbour Arm) mobbed, too.</p> \n<p>But this is early days, phase one of four, promising over the next couple of years everything from a “fine dining” restaurant to the revival of the cinema and ballroom. The mood is fantastic: upbeat, from a crowd of older locals reliving their youth to cool young thangs attracted by Margate’s burgeoning reputation as Dalston-sur-Mer; fiftysomething men in braces and Harringtons, candy-floss-chomping teens… People are picnicking on the fake lawn beside the hair and beauty caravan, children gyrating newly bought hula-hoops to the strains of I’ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts. Elsewhere, drag queens in Hi-de-Hi! outfits groove to Blondie by the original 1940s toy car circuit, and a magician enthrals a crowd by the helter-skelter. Yes, there’s still work to be done.

In between Kanye West and Florence and the Machine, visitors will flock to food trucks and portable pubs, with around 500 traders due to set up stall on the festival site and more than 100 licensed premises. </p> \n<p>These small businesses have a captive audience. Each visitor spent more than &pound;466 on average at independent music festivals in 2014 (including the ticket price), according to<a href=\"http://aiforg.com/wp-content/uploads/AIF-Six-Year-Report-2014.pdf\"> research</a> from the Association of Independent Music Festivals (AIF). </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It isn’t just a bunch of stalls burning incense now as it was in the mid-nineties!</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Paul Reed, AIF</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The festival season is a huge marketing opportunity, too, and can provide a launch pad for small businesses. Cult London restaurant MEATliquor, for example, was first sampled at festivals. Paul Reed, general manager at <a href=\"http://aiforg.com/\">AIF</a>, says: “A presence at festivals can greatly enhance your brand. It isn’t just a bunch of stalls burning incense now as it was in the mid-nineties.”<br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.chunkychipswickeddips.co.uk/\">Chunky Chips,Wicked Dips</a> is one small business that has been increasing its festival appearances year-on-year. Steve Lavell and Jono Rich started the business six years ago while struggling to find jobs after university. Since then, they’ve picked up slots at nearly every festival, including Glastonbury, <a href=\"http://www.secretgardenparty.com/\">Secret Garden Party</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bestival.net/\">Bestival</a> on the Isle of Wight, and <a href=\"http://www.readingfestival.com/\">Reading</a>. Lavell says: “Word spreads rapidly at festivals and we get return custom.” </p> \n<p>Lavell admits it can be tough to get into bigger festivals as a small trader – to win a pitch at Glastonbury they were competing with 3000 other enterprises. Selling at festivals isn’t cheap, either. It cost &pound;10,000 for their pitch at Latitude, which had to be paid several months in advance. But the &pound;19,000 made in sales alleviated the cost. </p> \n<p>The pitching process for most festivals begins the previous autumn. Lavell says their festival calendar starts in October, when the Glastonbury online applications open (they close in December). Most festival applications shut by March, with around a month for the selected businesses to complete the documentation and pay for the pitch. For Glastonbury this is sped up, with a week’s turnaround.<br /></p> \n<p>Organising stock is another thing to consider. Chunky Chips, Wicked Dips have all stock delivered to the site on the first day and store it in vans. At Glastonbury, they’ve got two, which are big enough to hold all the ingredients for the four days. By trial and error, Lavell and Rich have a good idea of how much they’ll sell and rarely have stock left over. <br /></p> \n<p>Lavell says: “We have a small menu, which makes it easier to feed the masses. It’s about getting a happy medium of quantity and quality.” </p> \n<p>Lavell reckons Bestival is the most profitable festival for his business. “It’s the most fun to sell at,” he adds. This year, Bestival has chosen Chunky Chips, Wicked Dips as one of a small number of traders organisers expect to earn the most. This means Lavell and Rich will be given pitches in the most popular areas of the site. As part of this arrangement, the organisers take a 28% cut of the business profits. Lavell says they are happy with this, given the better chance of sales. Typically, the cut taken by festival organisers ranges from 25-30%. </p> \n<p>With this in mind, they have to keep tight tabs on their annual budget, with most of the earnings coming in over the summer and pitch fees paid well in advance. But, they also sell at winter events. Last year they won a contract to sell at a fireworks display at Alexandra Palace as well as darts and ice rink events.<br /></p> \n<p>A traditional pitch isn’t the only way to catch the attention of festival goers. There are other marketing opportunities for canny entrepreneurs.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cf05070af0458bfb3fc84cbb642ccfacf184f39\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434727754809/03c15e3c-7cb0-4510-954e-5e24e55bde68-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"women at festival\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the MOA team at Secret Garden Party last year.

Cosmetics brand <a href=\"http://www.moa.london/pages/beauty\">MOA</a>, which sells herbal skin care products, has teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.wildwellbeing.co.uk/\">Wild Wellbeing</a>, which runs massage stalls at festivals. Wild Wellbeing used MOA’s products in the massages, promoting them to its customers.</p> \n<p>MOA is sponsoring all Wild Wellbeing’s on-site massages at <a href=\"http://www.greenman.net/\">Green Man </a>festival this year. It’s also the first time MOA staff have a pitch to sell products from. To encourage passers by to make a pit stop, they’ll be offering craft activities, such as making flower headbands.<br /></p> \n<p>Charlie Fowler, creative and managing director at MOA, says: “We’re quite a niche brand – but we find the right type of customer at festivals.” She says it is hard to judge benefit of festivals in terms of sales, but thinks it helps to build MOA’s image. “People reach out to us after they’ve seen the brand at a particular festival,” she says. </p> \n<p>Reed says independent festivals, such as Green Man, allow small business to be creative in their promotional approach. “The best kind of marketing doesn’t feel at all like marketing,” he adds. “I’m not sure that such partnerships would be as possible at huge commercial events.”</p> \n<p>However, Reed points out that 30% of festival-goers in 2014 were 17-24 years old, so visitors’ age and spending power should be considered before signing up. <br /></p> \n<p>Barry Tiffen has 25 years of experience of selling at festivals with his vegetarian food stall, <a href=\"http://www.mobileveggiefood.co.uk/\">Goodness Gracious Healthy Foods</a>, which was named concession of the year at the UK Festival Awards last year. He says bigger festivals are less worthwhile for traders, with the exception of Glastonbury. “You can make a good living [there]. It attracts middle class people who have money to spend and there’s an range of age groups.” He says this is preferable to the younger demographic of Reading or Leeds, who tend to skimp on healthy food.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It helps to build relationship with our customers. And we have some good reviews on our website through festivals.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Charlie Fowler, MOA</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Reed agrees: “It’s not necessarily a numbers game in terms of footfall. That doesn’t matter if everyone is walking past your stall but not engaging. Its about reaching the right audience.”<br /></p> \n<p>Fowler thinks targeting such customers helps to boost MOA’s online profile. “It’s really effective in terms of social returns. When someone meets you, or encounters your product at a festival, they might ‘like’ you on Facebook, or interact with you on Twitter. It helps to build relationship with our customers. And we have some good reviews on our website through festivals.”<br /></p> \n<p>While festivals can be a marketing boon, they require a lot of organisation and there are nitty gritty aspects to take into account, including health and safety regulations.<br /></p> \n<p>Reed says: “It’s important for organisers to have all of their licensing requirements, insurance and health and safety procedures in place.” He adds that, for food traders, the caterers association (NCASS) has launched an online<a href=\"http://www.ncass.org.uk/eho-area/ncass-connect\"> hub</a> demonstrating due diligence and documentation. “There isn’t something similar for non-food traders, but there should be,” he adds. “It’s something we are looking at.”</p> \n<p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>","section":"Guardian Small Business Network","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434727396590/f8ccfcb2-390a-42d8-bb37-da32263db850-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ian Gavan/Getty Images","altText":"festival goers in front of glastonbury sign","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434727755314/67b36c63-64da-4e27-b054-fac26d898b5e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Some of the MOA team at Secret Garden Party last year.
