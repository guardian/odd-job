A brunch of <em>huevos rancheros</em> and pancakes is a good start before an assault on its IPAs, as, later, might be shared charcuterie and cheese boards or small plates such as short rib in Baltic porter gravy or mac’n’cheese balls with arrabiata sauce. The best value is in its larger plates and, particularly, in taking them away, as you get 25% off. I lingered over a half of Cloudwater’s excellent spring 2015 IPA (&pound;2.24, Junkyard has 15 keg lines), while the kitchen rustled up my Cuban sandwich: a serious stack of ham, salami and roast pork, topped with Swiss cheese, dill pickles and French’s mustard, served on (for once) genuinely lactic, grilled sourdough.

All the action happens on the plate, in a variety of tapas and meze which, between midday and 4pm, Wednesday to Saturday, cost &pound;6.95 for three. Portions are very generous and the food, while not boasting much in the way of finesse, delivers big, robust flavours. A herby sausage (<em>loukanika</em>), sliced and fried in onions, had a rather chewy texture, like an overdone Frankfurter, but was curiously moreish. The <em>stifado</em> beef casserole, its tomato sauce fragrant with cinnamon and mined with tiny black peppercorns, is like meeting a friend’s jovial Greek uncle: it is a stocky, bustling, back-slapping pleasure.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Lunch from &pound;4.95. 5 Thurland Street, 0115 950 1000, </em><a href=\"http://www.yamas.co.uk/\"><em>yamas.co.uk</em></a><em>.

As well as a highly creditable flat white (coffee from &pound;1.70), it is also a good place to pick up filled croissants, quiches and offbeat soups and salads, all prepared on site each morning. The sandwiches are not huge (for the money, &pound;4.95), but this is a matter of quality over quantity. These innovatively filled flatbreads and sangers – BBQ pulled chicken, tomato, smoked cheddar; cauliflower cheese with chilli and spinach – certainly deliver on flavour. My braised beef baguette with mustard and emmental actually made effective use of one of food’s most egregious ingredients, red and yellow peppers.

Oscar and Rosie’s has thin-crust, stone-baked pizzas topped with high-quality ingredients, from (terrific) ham hock to butternut squash, and they have names such as Meat Sweats and Boom Chicken Wah-Wah. Personally, I prefer a Neapolitan slice (simple, wood-fired, classic ingredients), but this was nonetheless thoroughly enjoyable pie.

It serves hot rolls (fish fingers and homemade tartare sauce, pulled pork and honey mustard etc), cheeseboards and snack items all day and, until 4pm, a set lunch that includes main courses at &pound;7.95. The Hand and Heart’s rare, sweet’n’smoky bavette steak, served with a decent garnish of leaves and pickled radish, has to be one of Nottingham’s best bargains. The chips are an abrupt challenge to accepted wisdom, too: they are bought-in and fried on-site and – utterly crisp without, perfectly fluffy within – are miles better than most pubs’ attempts at homemade, triple-cooked chips.

Its profits fund the upkeep of the building and the group’s street pastors, who offer assistance to distressed late-night revellers. Militant atheists may bridle at the subtext to all this, but you would have to look hard to discern any Christian messaging at Malt Cross. There may be a dedicated prayer room somewhere, but to most people this will simply look like a beautiful old building, which serves superb craft and cask beers (pint from &pound;3.30), and great hulking piles of smoked meats – as sandwiches and salads.

These people eat their burgers with minimal toppings and can tell you, in detail, the correct ratio of fat to lean meat and the precise blend of chuck, brisket, sirloin or short rib that will produce the finest all-beef burger. Annie’s American owner, Anmarie Spaziano, takes a more freewheeling approach. She makes what she describes as “authentic Rhode Island-style burgers” (85% beef, 15% pork, distinctively seasoned with smoked paprika), and is not afraid of outlandish toppings, from seafood sauce and king prawns to square Scottish sausage. I was a little sceptical, but my “German” – a well-charred and moist burger, topped with sauerkraut and American mustard – was highly persuasive. Little wonder this homage to rural US diners has been such a hit. Please note, not all of the Annie’s menu comes in below this series’ &pound;10-a-head cut-off. There’s a choice of 10 burger and hotdog meals for under &pound;10. Incidentally, if you love “dude food” and are a little short on cash, you may want to check out the &pound;6.95, express lunch dishes at Red’s True Barbecue (11 Queen Street, <a href=\"http://truebarbecue.com/nottingham/\">truebarbecue.com</a>).<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Meals from &pound;8.90. 5 Broadway, Lace Market, 07463 033255, </em><a href=\"http://www.anniesburgershack.com/\"><em>anniesburgershack.com</em></a><em>.

Five miles out of the centre, in Wollaton, is the multi-award-winning <a href=\"http://www.codsscallops.com/\">Cod’s Scallops</a>. George’s Tradition – about three miles from the centre, in West Bridgford – may not enjoy quite the same glittering rep but it knocks out a reliably good fish supper and is actually more convenient – particularly if you are visiting Trent Bridge for the cricket or Nottingham Forest’s City Ground (they are 15 minutes away on foot). The menu at George’s, a small regional chain, takes in homemade pies, fishcakes and sustainably caught cod and haddock served in an admirably clean, light batter with genuine chip-shop chips. That is, chips that are a little chewy and caramelised at the edges, rather than shatteringly crisp, and that taste readily of freshly harvested potato. The tartare sauce, however, a sweet indistinct gloop, needs work. A good tartare, chunky with capers and gherkins, is a simple thing to produce and can transform good fish and chips, which these undoubtedly are, into a truly outstanding meal.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Meals from &pound;3.35. 95 Melton Road, West Bridgford, </em><a href=\"https://www.georgestradition.co.uk/\"><em>georgestradition.co.uk</em></a><em>.

It’s all pretty impressive, more like a small hotel than a country pub.</p> \n<p>Downstairs, rippled flagstone floors, and walls lined with antique portraits and framed yellowing pages from hunting manuals provide the kind of heritage touches that Japanese and American tourists coo over (while nursing a tankard of Oxford Gold ale).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bea755b2ddcd910ad3f3af5c1284cdeb277e8a6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433243590902/36c3040f-31ba-4bfa-ac8a-8aedaecb5d81-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"The Porch House,\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In a place like this it would be easy to serve any old food and make a killing, but someone in the kitchen is making an effort.

But this isn’t just any piece of wood: it is the oldest grapevine on Earth, as certified by Guinness World Records. At about 450 years old, the <a href=\"http://maribor-pohorje.si/worlds-oldest-vine.aspx\">Old Vine</a> has survived war, fire and pestilence, and still produces fat bunches of red Žametovka grapes (most vines slow down at the tender age of 40). Bottles of the Old Vine’s precious wine – which is admittedly undrinkable – have been presented to popes, presidents, emperors … and Brad Pitt.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ce8cb5bc410a2b3bdb389284eba91c0915ca0ac\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433335082296/1c7cee01-279a-4445-bff4-ccb5829761f1-382x420.jpeg\" alt=\"The Old Vine\" width=\"382\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Old Vine</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The vine is the jewel in the crown of Maribor, Slovenia’s wine-loving second city, in the north-east of the country, which can now be reached by direct flights from Southend with <a href=\"https://www.adria.si/en/\">Adria Airways</a>. In Maribor, 11 November isn’t Remembrance Day but <a href=\"http://maribor-pohorje.si/top-events/st-martins-day-celebrations-in-maribor.aspx\">St Martin’s Day</a>, a drunken party to mark the end of the <a href=\"http://maribor-pohorje.si/old-vine-festival.aspx\">Old Vine festival </a>and honour the saint who turned grape juice into wine. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anton_Martin_Slom%C5%A1ek\">Anton Martin Slomšek</a>, who became the city’s first bishop in 1846, is also well-known for writing a popular drinking song. The city has two statues of Bacchus, the god of wine; Slovenes joke that visitors can get drunk just breathing the air here.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.slovenia.info/en/Museums-and-galleries/The-Old-Vine-House.htm?muzej=9389&amp;lng=2\">Old Vine Museum </a>(Vojašniška 8) offers tastings (from €4) of Slovenian grape varieties, such as crisp, herbaceous zelen, and pinot gris, gew&uuml;rztraminer and muscat. I tried sweet ice wine, made from grapes that have frozen on the vine. There are also tastings at <a href=\"http://maribor-pohorje.si/vinag-wine-cellar0.aspx\">Vinag</a>, one of the biggest cellars in Europe: it holds 5&frac12; million litres of wine in 2&frac12;km of tunnels under the city’s Trg Svobode (Freedom Square), including a riesling made during the second world war.</p> \n<p>Two good wine bars are ultra-modern <a href=\"http://www.rozmarin.si/en\">Rozmarin</a> (Gosposka 8), and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/LUFT-kavica-zabavica/698706616911408\">Luft</a> (Vita Kraigherja 3), a smart space with great views on the top floor of the Communist-era Slavija hotel (now offices). Both serve a delicate šipon white made by Benedictine monks at their Dveri Pax winery a few miles north of the city. On the banks of the Drava, the 16th-century Water Tower (Usnjarska 10) is now a romantic wine bar with live jazz and passing swans.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1fe4137c42f2c5713363eb1559c96e009509e258\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433334935021/cc43f89d-2f0b-4c39-a92b-bda0d94949e4-460x165.jpeg\" alt=\"Maribor on the banks of the Drava\" width=\"460\" height=\"165\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maribor on the banks of the Drava</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maribor is also a great base for exploring the Drava Valley vineyards, perhaps on an electric bike hired from <a href=\"http://www.kulebike.si/\">KULeBIKE</a>, which has downloadable routes and free transfers from the city.</p> \n<p>But there is more to Maribor than wine – it has great beer, too. Postna, a street near the university, has a cluster of lively bars: Isabella (no 3) serves <a href=\"http://bevog.at/#\">Bevog</a> pale ale and oatmeal stout made by a Slovene in a microbrewery just over the Austrian border. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TheLivingRoomMB/timeline\">The Living Room</a> on Glavni Square, one of the three main squares, serves guest ales from breweries such as Reservoir Dogs in western Slovenia. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Udarnikcafe/timeline\">Udarnik Cafe</a> on Grajski Square is a great circular space in a 1930s cinema, with film quotes on the wall and seriously cheap beer.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fe63db3fee1de673ff97875bbe2ce9c97f372bad\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433335464776/2117ac55-5638-4a87-a67d-e783ed724d86-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Udarnik Cafe\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Udarnik Cafe</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Slovenian cuisine is an interesting mix of Balkan and Mediterranean. <a href=\"http://www.trijeribniki.si/en/#about\">Gostilna Pri treh Ribnikih</a> (+386 2 23 44 170, Ribniška 9) is Maribor’s oldest restaurant (established 1825), in a park north of the centre. I had wild garlic soup, zander fillets with polenta and asparagus, and a yoghurt parfait. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RestavracijainpivnicaStajerc/timeline\">Štajerc</a> (+386 2 234 42 34, Vetrinjska 30), in the old town, does Slovenian specialities such as stuffed squid, washed down with the restaurant’s startlingly green beer.</p> \n<p>Architecturally, Maribor is a mixed bag, too: those expecting a little Ljubljana will be disappointed. It was badly bombed during the second world war, and President Tito’s reconstruction will not be universally admired. But there is plenty left to enjoy: the 15th-century castle, the even older cathedral, the Renaissance town hall, the synagogue. Maribor hit hard times after the breakup of Yugoslavia, and again in the 2008 financial crisis, and unemployment is still high. After a huge shopping centre opened on the edge of town in 2000, many city centre shops went out of business.</p> \n<p>Things are improving, though. Farm shops such as <a href=\"http://www.zadruga-dobrina.si/\">Zadruga Dobrina Trgovina</a>, on narrow Tkalski prehod, sell local food and wine, and nearby at Gosposka 7, <a href=\"http://www.artmar.si/Index.asp?action=trgovina\">Art Mar</a> sells contemporary Slovenian arts and crafts. The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SALON.maribor/timeline\">Salon of Applied Arts</a> on Glavni Square is a symbol of this regeneration: formerly a grand cafe, it became a casino, then went bust. Now it is a beautifully restored cafe-bar that hosts gigs and sells work by local designers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59e110fb23a8af30071c66ac113fd471fe8efde6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433335624732/8e80719e-ed43-45b8-8d93-79aff8fc6a1c-460x386.jpeg\" alt=\"Contemporary crafts at Art Mar\" width=\"460\" height=\"386\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Contemporary crafts at Art Mar</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Maribor was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2011/dec/30/maribor-slovenia-european-capital-culture\">European capital of culture in 2012</a> and is home to Slovenia’s biggest festival, <a href=\"http://www.festival-lent.si/en/\">Lent</a> (26 June-11 July), which has nothing to do with Easter, and the <a href=\"http://www.sng-mb.si/en/\">Slovene National Theatre</a>, where I caught an experimental production of Dracula: lots of nudity, swearing and politics but a conspicuous lack of vampires.</p> \n<p>The city’s hotels haven’t kept pace with its cuisine and culture, however. Those in the centre tend to be business-focused, and there are “luxury” (but very dated) options near the Pohorje ski area. The closest thing to a boutique is <a href=\"http://cityhotel-mb.si/en/\">Hotel City</a> (doubles from €80 B&amp;B), built in 2011, which has 66 modern rooms and a top-floor bar/restaurant serving seasonal menus – in June, the focus is on porcini and chanterelle mushrooms.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"886e44d6e31f3931ff92ac3a4aa57a0ec7aecc6e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433335851946/58ac8f39-3f55-480e-9130-138052b82049-460x306.jpeg\" alt=\"Tourist farm Stern Pri Kovacniku\" width=\"460\" height=\"306\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tourist farm Stern Pri Kovacniku</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Another option is a farm stay.

Breakfast was a lavish spread, including home-cured ham and a tarragon and strawberry cake. There was lots more homegrown food at dinner – pearled spelt with wild garlic pesto was a revelation – plus three local wines to wash it all down. None was particularly old – and all were definitely drinkable.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Flights were provided by </em><a href=\"https://www.adria.si\"><em>Adria Airways</em></a><em>, which flies from Southend to Maribor from €139 return.

been one of Europe’s top party cities, with its famous ruin pubs and late-night bars where a pint, shot or glass of wine often costs less than a pound. Right now, the city is undergoing a craft beer revolution; not just bars devoted to ales but microbreweries opening across the country and a young generation of “Gypsy brewers” conjuring up new recipes at home, renting brewery space and creating intriguing beers. Prices remain very reasonable – &pound;1-&pound;1.50 for roughly a pint of draught – and the highlight of the year is <a href=\"http://www.fozdefeszt.hu/\">Főzdefeszt</a>, a three-day festival celebrating Hungarian beers and street food. It is expected that 40,000 beer enthusiasts will attend from 5-7 June, though if you can’t be there our selection should help give you a “head” start on any future visits.</p> \n<h2>&Eacute;lesztő Craftbeer Garden</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"855371fb99135a689282665c6ae7fbc41bfb94c8\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433424763698/4875ed0d-37cc-4255-a1ab-acba24d8e9f9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"&Eacute;leszt&iquest; Craftbeer Garden, Budapest\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>&Eacute;lesztő, or “Yeast”, is a must-see; a rambling post-industrial space that was once a glassworks.

The latest innovation is a beer-cocktail bar run by mixologist G&aacute;bor N&eacute;meth, who stirs creations such as &Eacute;den, a startling combination of lemon juice, lavender and honey syrup, Tanqueray, a dash of bitters and American Beauty pale ale, garnished with a lemon pill, chocolate truffle, juniper and hops.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><em> Tűzolt&oacute; utca 22 +36 70 233 5052, </em><a href=\"http://www.elesztohaz.hu/\"><em>elesztohaz.hu</em></a><em>.

Kolos K&oacute;sa, a craft-beer fanatic, opened L&eacute;hűtő when he was organising the first Főzdefeszt, and currently, he explains, indicating a huge map on the bar’s wall: “The choice for beer-lovers is incredible, with around 50 artisan microbreweries dotted round Hungary producing over 200 different craft beers.” With around 60 brews to choose from, it is difficult to know where to start, but Kolos recommends at least tasting Fekete Erdő (Black Forest), a porter using forest fruit and four types of malt, Keserű M&eacute;z (Bitter Honey), a lager that actually has a bitter honey, ale-like taste, and V&ouml;r&ouml;sbegy (Red Robin), a delicious caramel malt brew.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Holl&oacute; utca 12-14,+36 30 731 0430, </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/lehuto.kezmuvessorozo\"><em>Facebook page</em></a>.<em> Open Sun-Tues 4pm-midnight, Wed-Thurs 4pm-2am, Fri-Sat 4pm-6am</em></p> \n<h2>J&oacute;n&aacute;s Craft Beer House</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"175ef8bbbfee109ddc7ecd2e0fd470805eda8f74\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433424917760/86f2cf89-1a75-48c8-834c-848a716b55aa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"J&oacute;n&aacute;s Craft Beer House, Budapest\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You can’t miss the giant whale-like glass and metal B&aacute;lna building on the edge of the Danube just by the Liberty bridge.

This is an institution for beer aficionados and Gergely has been brewing his own since 2009, joking that: “The difficult part of my job is that I try every beer, so I am sure I really do like it before I sell it.” Although he is a pioneer of the local beer revolution, he also stocks ales from around the world.

Not only does he make some of Hungary’s finest craft beers, he has led the way in collaborating with young Gypsy brewers, giving them the chance to come and create their own beers in his brewery. A trip to his Beerhouse is definitely for beer fanatics as it is a half-hour tram/train trek into the suburbs. But the tourists who make it out get a warm welcome, there is a beer garden and the chance to try zsiroskeny&eacute;r, Hungary’s favourite bar snack: a slice of bread thickly spread with pork lard topped with raw onions. Rizmajer admits: “I am a malt rather than hop fanatic. I always wanted to make my own Guinness, but I never liked the bitterness, so instead I made a sweeter porter stout, and even a chocolate stout, where cocoa beans soaked in alcohol are added into the mix.” Not to be missed is Cortez, his unique corn beer that Budapest’s many burger and Mexican restaurants are stocking instead of Corona.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span><em> Tancsics Mih&aacute;ly utca 110, +36 1 277 2395, </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rizmajersor?fref=ts\"><em>Facebook page</em></a><em>.

To Danes from Copenhagen, with its pancake-flat surroundings, the Baltic island’s rolling hills and steep cliffs made a welcome change, while its location – 20 miles from Sweden and closer to Poland than to the Danish capital – made it feel like an exotic destination. But the advent of low-cost flights to places like the Canary Islands and Thailand in the 1980s changed all that. And Bornholm has had to reinvent itself.</p> \n<p>First, it became a “gourmet island”, home to <a href=\"http://www.kadeau.dk/bornholm_english.php\">Kadeau</a>, the celebrated restaurant of the local Michelin-starred chef Rasmus Kofoed. Now the island’s big ambition is to be 100% green by 2025 – a carbon-neutral community based on sustainable, renewable energy. The latest venture is the Green Solution House, the world’s first “cradle-to-cradle”(C2C) hotel, built with reusable or biodegradable materials, which was officially opened by Denmark’s Crown Prince Frederik this April.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"807c5ea771a21623e8859d1c6ec97ee308f40fb3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433246486058/6f2d6918-172e-4746-a670-6353f7fe42e9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kadeau, Bornholm, Copenhagen; DenmarkKadeauBornholmMarie Louise MunkegaardPhotographerCopenhagenDenmark\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Outdoor seating at Kadeau restaurant.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marie Louise Munkegaard</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Bornholm is also where the iconic Christiania cargo bikes are made, and its biggest reinvention has arguably been to turn itself into a cycling paradise. Since 1981, it has rolled out northern Europe’s largest network of cycling routes: 150 miles of paths criss-crossing and circling the island, many following forest tracks and disused railway lines far from any traffic. The local tourism agency estimates that 30,000 cyclists arrive every year. The island’s size – about half as big again as the Isle of Wight – is perfect for a short break or even a week-long biking adventure. And whatever the Danes might think, it is actually pretty flat. Here are the highlights for a tour on two wheels …</p> \n<h2>Best cycle route</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3ace01de7677f34e5edd47952483bfbe20b8fd6a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433246720396/b8ed1843-1517-4c66-8e6e-d8a2fc1c7534-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Sunset over sea --- Image by   torolfvaagan/RooM The Agency/Corbisbeautybeauty in natureBornholmCapital Region of DenmarkcloudsdaytimeDenmarkEuropeeveningflowergrasslandgrowthhorizon over wateridylliclens flarelightlushmeadownatural worldnobodyoutdoorsreflectionripplesrural sceneScandinaviascenicseaseasonsserenitysummersunsetsunshinewaterwildflowersZealand\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sunset on the sea … the coastal cycling route is the island’s most picturesque.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For the simple satisfaction of rounding an island, the 64-mile coastal route wins out. The start is on forest paths on the west coast, then there is a climb past the ruin of <a href=\"http://www.visitdenmark.com/denmark/hammershus-slotsruin-gdk614896\">Hammershus castle</a> and the rocky granite cliffs of the north; then it’s over the rolling hills of the interior, with its bright yellow fields of rapeseed, pastures, and Christmas trees, before the path takes you back from the sandy beaches of the south. The cross-island routes are further from the main roads and, in some cases, they are stunning. </p> \n<p>The route between Klemensker and R&oslash; takes you down a narrow fissure valley between steep cliffs. Others cross Almindingen forest, one of Denmark’s largest, where in mid-May the beeches and birch were a vibrant green. In autumn, the colours are incredible. You could do the round-trip route in a day, but the resort towns of Allinge, Gudhjem and Svaneke, and the pretty fishing villages between them – Teglk&aring;s and Snogeb&aelig;k stand out – are perfectly spaced out for taking it slower, stopping every couple of hours to explore the alleys between whitewashed, low-roofed cottages, feasting on smoked fish, and visiting the sites. The official cycling guide recommends four days.</p> \n<h2>Best beach</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6daac510b1b3c778290c41fbf6be71beb674bf11\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433253637747/2962068b-2451-4ca3-98b7-8a36d28ce4b7-460x287.jpeg\" alt=\"The beach at Dueodde.\" width=\"460\" height=\"287\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Orange</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Dueodde is easily the best beach on the island, and possibly the best in Denmark. The sand – almost white and so fine it was used in hourglasses – curves around the island’s south-eastern tip, backed by dunes and pine. It’s good for swimming, as there’s always deep water close to shore between the sandbars. Be warned though, the Baltic takes time to warm up, so swimming before mid-June is only for the hardy. Besides the beach, Dueodde has Scandinavia’s highest lighthouse, two German bunkers, and a much-loved ice-cream parlour, Bornholm Softice, but not much else. I also liked clambering over the rocky coastline in the north, particularly south of Svaneke, where a craggy ledge pushes out some 50 meters into the sea, meaning you can drop immediately into deep water.</p> \n<h2>Best places for food and drink</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3004d6a3d436232fe5d8d9af9744f46bc6b92711\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433249486289/1afd084a-0276-4da0-9211-706abe55c970-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Herring smoke house attached to a cottage on the island of Bornholm, Denmark \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Many old cottages on the island have pyramid-shaped chimneys for hot-smoking.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Gudhjem’s smokery is the traditional home of the Bornholm speciality Sol over Gudhjem: a smoked herring fillet on rye bread, topped with radish, dill, a little mound of salt, and a raw egg yolk. But it’s not the best place to eat it, as most of its herrings are now smoked elsewhere and the yolk seemed like it had come from a bottle. Instead, I’d recommend the <a href=\"http://www.hasleroegeri.dk/\">Hasle smokery</a>, the first stop out of R&oslash;nne. If you get there for 10.30am, you can watch the artisans dive into the smoky chamber above an open fire and pull out rods hung with golden-smoked herrings, the so-called “Bornholmers”. The local hot-smoking technique is the reason why many old fishing cottages on the island have unusual pyramid-shaped chimneys. Eating freshly smoked herring while still lukewarm is special, and at &pound;5.40 not too expensive. You can eat it at tables outside in the harbour as you watch the ferries go out to the tiny island of Christians&oslash;. Gudhjem has often been judged the island’s most beautiful village, and it is a great place to break up a round-trip. <a href=\"http://www.hotelklippen.dk/index.php?lang=en\">Hotel Klippen</a> (doubles from &pound;58 B&amp;B), with good food and clean, simple rooms that look down from a clifftop to the waves below, is a good choice. Or if you want to experience a traditional Danish Bathing Hotel, try the imposing <a href=\"http://www.stammershalle-badehotel.dk/pages/da/stammershalle-badehotel.php\">StammersHalle Badehotel</a> (doubles from &pound;87 B&amp;B), builton the rocky coastline in 1911.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"600a1290eaffc1990e445a9da45e1642f3058c8f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433247150465/18fa5438-8e6b-4ea7-a449-dbfa3a9b9af0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kadeau, Bornholm, Denmark\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fine dining at Kadeau. </span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mary Louise Munkegaard</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>For dedicated gourmands, though, it’s all about Restaurant Kadeau. Opened eight years ago in the dunes of the south, it was a trailblazer of the New Nordic style, sourcing and foraging its ingredients from the surrounding countryside and sea, with a heavy reliance on forest herbs and berries, pickling and smoking. Pork from the forest pigs, which forage freely outside Svaneke, is a speciality. A two-course lunch is &pound;30; the full tasting menu costs &pound;100. If you’re doing the circuitous cycle trip, you’ll be nearly finished when you reach Kadeau, so you’ll deserve it.</p> \n<h2>Best small town</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"148514cbd98e3d6cf9b71377b00644c6bc5f0521\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433247480247/f55eb126-c8d6-435b-8ff3-05a08a4f6f6c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"E5XG3W Denmark, Bornholm Island Pictures taken between 1st and 5th August 2014.

It is also arguably prettier, with handsome old merchants’ houses in the harbour and narrow alleys of half-timbered houses leading down from the town square. It also has Svaneke Bodega, one of the island’s best pubs, which even early in the season, was lively with locals and tourists. It serves beers from the town’s tiny brewery, <a href=\"http://bornholm.info/en/brewery-svaneke-bryghus-on-bornholm\">Svaneke Bryghus</a>, which include an excellent stout and brown ale. The town is also home to Svaneke Bolcher, where you can watch traditional Danish sweets being made, and <a href=\"http://liquorice.nu/\">Johan B&uuml;low</a>’s inventive liquorice, which is now sold in shops such as Harvey Nichols and Fortnum &amp; Mason.</p> \n<h2>Best places to stay</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c8275e23f1ea74c3778998825d4207cf15256e5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433247385305/3b0066ff-fba6-4f4a-85f2-1a0b89b07a01-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Green Solution House\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Green Solution House</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.greensolutionhouse.dk/\">Green Solution House</a> (doubles from &pound;117 B&amp;B), which opened in April, seeks to imitate natural systems by using reusable and biodegradable materials. Copenhagen architects GXN reused glass and bricks from the hotel previously on the site, turning the glass into “glass wool insulation” and the bricks into foundations. Waste water is fed into glass cylinders filled with algae, which cleans it before it is used to water the plants. The algae itself is then turned into gas and used to generate electricity, supplementing the solar cells built into the windows and balconies. But GXN has done all this at the same time as creating a restful, airy space. The restaurant aims to join Kadeau and Stammarshalle Badehotel in the list of gourmet destinations. The only thing guests may miss is the swimming pool, which has been repurposed as an insulated reservoir storing 80,000 litres of water heated by the hotel’s solar panels.</p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.hullehavn.dk/\">Hullehavn Camping</a> (adults &pound;7, kids up to 11 &pound;3.50, tent hire &pound;2), five minutes’ drive from Svaneke, has one of the best locations, sheltered by trees and looking out to sea over a rocky plateau broken up with sandy inlets, where you can watch the sun rise in the morning and watch it set at night.</p> \n<ul> \n <li>This article was amended on 5 June 2015.
