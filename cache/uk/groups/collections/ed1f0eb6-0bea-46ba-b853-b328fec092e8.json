Paso Robles, 20 miles up state route 46, is in the heart of California’s Central Coast wine region. Paso, as locals know it, is in San Luis Obispo county, where the Salinas river runs out of the Santa Lucia mountains. The city of Paso Robles has a quaint downtown surrounded by 20 square miles of coastal mountain terrain.</p> \n<p>Although wine-making in the region dates back two centuries to when missionaries first began growing grapes, it’s only recently that the Paso Robles American Viticultural Area (AVA, a federally recognised wine classification) has become a region to watch. In the past decade the numbers of producers and acres under vine have doubled, and now the Paso Robles AVA is the fastest-growing wine region in the US, with over 200 boutique and family-owned wineries producing zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon and other varietals from Spain, Italy, Bordeaux and the Rhone.</p> \n<p>The terrain offers plenty for the eye: flat river valley floodplains give way to sweeping slopes dotted with homesteads, farms and wineries, with most vineyards sitting on rolling hillsides between 500 and 1,000 feet above sea level. One of Paso’s charms is its as-yet-undiscovered feel: on-property tasting rooms are cosy and nowhere near as packed as those in Napa valley, and are more often than not manned by the vintners themselves. And Paso’s charming historic downtown has great new places to eat and drink without the crowds – or the higher price point – of its more famous northern counterpart.</p> \n<h2><strong>WINEMAKERS TO VISIT</strong></h2> \n<h2>Bianchi</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eb876386e96e609b636a7eb530d4e1a70da1418\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434472899787/0d04312d-c83f-4762-9af2-d872c401f2dd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bianchi Wine, Paso Robles, California\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In September 2014, Bianchi’s zinfandel beat stiff competition to be crowned California Zinfandel Champion. Of the 93 wines entered, only four won double gold; Bianchi’s was one, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/may/20/california-sonoma-valley-wine-route-top-10-guide\">the other three were from Sonoma</a>, a wine region neighbouring Napa. Known for estate-grown and hand-crafted wines, the Bianchi family’s wine producing heritage dates from 1974, when Joseph Bianchi and his son Glenn set up shop on the banks of the San Joaquin river, eight miles from downtown Paso. Winemaker Tom Lane attributes the brand’s recent success to the 2011 zinfandel’s subtle layers, something he strives to achieve in every vintage through experimentation with fruit from different vineyards, changing harvest times, new yeast strains, and fermentation and aging regimes in spicy barrel types. A glass-walled tasting room overlooks flat fields of vines that begin to sweep upwards to the rear of the property and, inside, a fireplace and warm earth tones create a welcoming setting for winter tastings. Outside, a patio borders a lake teeming with koi carp gliding beneath miniature sailboats.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>3380 Branch Road, Paso Robles, +1 805 226 9922, </em><a href=\"http://www.bianchiwine.com/\"><em>bianchiwine.com</em></a><em>.

Baldwin now has 25 vintages under his belt and Isosceles – a blend of cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc and merlot – remains the winery’s flagship and best-seller. Its other labels are delicious, too, particularly the big bold reds made using old world methods, such as harvesting by hand and small barrel-ageing in French oak. Sixteen miles from downtown Paso, its tasting room and restaurant have panoramic views of vineyards that undulate with the rolling hills. There’s also a three-room inn, where stays (from $375 a night for two) include a complimentary tasting experience: choose from a “deconstruction” or vertical tasting of different vintages of Isosceles, or a library tasting hosted in the Chateau, Justin Baldwin’s former home.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>11680 Chimney Rock Road, Paso Robles, +1 805 238 6932, </em><a href=\"http://justinwine.com/\"><em>justinwine.com</em></a><em>.

Every wine in their portfolio is estate-grown over 200 acres of vineyards – half are east of Paso Robles and the other half are at the Templeton Gap winery – but only a small proportion of the grapes they grow become Red Soles wine; the rest are sold to large wineries. Randy and Cheryl also run the Hacienda-style, terracotta-coloured tasting room.

Forget standing in a crowded bar trying to avoid being stabbed in the eye by a tourist wielding a cocktail stick loaded with chorizo: it’s time for a proper meal, with chairs, and tables. But restaurants in a place such as Barcelona can empty your wallet quickly; the answer is a men&uacute; del d&iacute;a, the ubiquitous set lunch. The best offer good value and quality and they’ll see you through to the evening and back on the tapas trail.</p> \n<p><strong>All men&uacute;s here include three courses, a drink and bread unless stated</strong></p> \n<h2>La Polpa, Eixample</h2> \n<p>A wander up Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia is pretty much a must-do, whether you’re gawping at Gaud&iacute; buildings or heading for the shops. But the Eixample is proper moneyed Barcelona. The shops, the people, and the restaurants are expensive. That’s why La Polpa, a couple of blocks off the Passeig, is such a find. It’s got linen napkins, smartly dressed staff and a patina of posh, but the men&uacute; is still only €10.30. That really is astonishingly good value for this part of town. The food is modern and expertly turned out. A standout was an exceptionally tasty loin of tuna in teriyaki sauce. Even the house wine, a muscat, was a cut above the usual men&uacute; offerings.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€10.30 for the men&uacute;.

Carrer de l’Hospital, all phone shops and dive bars, is fascinating and when you want a break you can duck into the courtyard of the 15th-century Hospital de la Santa Creu. It’s a lovely quiet space and there’s a little open-air restaurant, El Jardi, which puts out great food from its tiny kitchen. It’s not fancy stuff but delicious. I had a thick leek and potato soup packed with flavour and a hearty lentil and sausage casserole. Handily, this place ticks another spot off the Gaud&iacute; trail: the old hospital is where the architect died after being knocked down by a tram in 1926.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€9.90 for the men&uacute;.</em> <em>Carrer de l’Hospital 56, +34 933 291 550, </em><a href=\"http://www.eljardibarcelona.es/\"><em>eljardibarcelona.es</em></a><em>.

There’s no escape – time to go old school at the “House of Spoons”. It claims to be the oldest restaurant in Barcelona and the men&uacute; doesn’t feel like it has changed in a couple of hundred years. It’s always packed with Spanish families, gossiping <em>abuelas</em> and tourists. And they all look like they are having a very good time. Individual dishes are such good value (goose with apples is lovely, filling and only €9.50) that they almost make the €17.50 men&uacute; look expensive, but three courses give plenty of time to enjoy the atmosphere. The fish soup is not too heavy, which was a good job because I followed it with pig’s trotter cooked in cava and the inevitable <em>crema catalana</em>.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>€17.50 for the men&uacute;.</em> <em>Carrer d’en Quintana 5, +34 933 173 022, </em><a href=\"http://www.culleretes.com/en/home\"><em>culleretes.com</em></a><em>.

Given its climate and location, Iceland imports most of its fruit and vegetables. But at Fridheimar farm, near the town of Selfoss, 30 miles from Reykjavik, a large greenhouse produces 300 tonnes of them a year. Big, red, implausibly juicy specimens are harvested there every single day, despite the long, dark winters. Its farm cafe makes a great place to stop for a bloody mary with a brilliant tomato tang, or a perfect bowl of tomato soup.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a833dc4b2bf425f6b0e2d4ee0e0fb016a1d90c55\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113342848/eb9e6bb0-6fc5-4336-b4f5-caedad707ed7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Inside a greenhouse at Fridheimar, where geothermal energy is used to grow fruit and vegetables.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside a greenhouse at Fridheimar, where geothermal energy is used to grow fruit and vegetables.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Arctic-Images/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/apr/30/top-10-hotels-in-reykjavik\">Top 10 hotels in Reykjavik</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The farm’s Arctic location actually works in its favour: there are fewer pests here, and warm ocean currents keep the climate deceptively warm. Also, Iceland’s geothermal energy creates enough electricity to heat and light the plants all year round. A volcanic growing medium is used in place of soil and 600 bumble bees imported from Holland take care of pollination.</p> \n<p>It’s a major operation: the farm uses 1.2 megawatts of electric power, the equivalent of the domestic use of a town of 3,000 people. Computers control heat, humidity, CO2, lighting, and watering, while weather stations on the rooftops monitor wind speed and direction and sunlight.</p> \n<p>As well as the cafe, there are talks and exhibitions, riding demonstrations and a foodie souvenir shop. The bloody mary recipe is a secret, says Kn&uacute;tur Rafn &Aacute;rmann, who runs the farm with his wife Helena and their five children. But it’s all in the tomato.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <a href=\"http://fridheimar.is/en\"><em>fridheimar.is</em></a><em>, greenhouse tour &pound;4.50, bloody mary &pound;7.50</em></p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113103703/38b480af-e4b7-4c75-8e19-544bf238c017-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"PR","altText":"A bloody mary at Fridheimar greenhouse, Iceland","cleanCredit":"Photograph: PR"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434113343482/eb9e6bb0-6fc5-4336-b4f5-caedad707ed7-bestSizeAvailable.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":369,"width":615,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Inside a greenhouse at Fridheimar, where geothermal energy is used to grow fruit and vegetables.

If you know there are foods you love that are easy to get to, why wouldn’t you have a go at &shy;collecting them? I can’t think of anything nicer than eating food you’ve caught yourself. <br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/foraging\">Foraging</a> is great for all ages and you don’t need much kit to get started. A good knife helps and a bag to store your goods in. Start by taking a walk along the coastline. If you’re armed with a pocket book to identify species, you’ll find the experience so much more satisfying. <br /></p> \n<p>Rock pools are great for finding the odd largish crab or little fish, but I always find that if you walk along the rocks, you’ll find a bit of sea spinach growing, or some samphire. It’s best to go <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/foraging\">foraging</a> on an outgoing tide so everything is fresh and wet. <br /></p> \n<p>Avoid anywhere built-up or near harbours and marinas because of <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/environment/pollution\">pollution</a>. Don’t pick up anything if you don’t know what it is or anything dead. <br /></p> \n<p>One of my favourite catches is prawns. Last summer, my &shy;neighbour called me over – we have a little &shy;pontoon outside the front of our house in Brixham, Devon. He’d caught about 150 prawns and we sat on our steps and boiled them. We had a bottle of wine, looking out to sea, and wolfed them down in 20 minutes. Perfect.<strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Sea beets (also known as sea spinach)</strong><br />You can find these on rocky shores. Boil them in a pan over a fire – they’re a bit like tough leeks – and naturally salty. A spoonful or two of ricotta is a delicious addition, along with a bit of olive oil or butter, and plenty of black pepper. Available all year round but best between April and July.</p> \n<p><strong>Clams and mussels</strong><br />Wait until low tide when it should be easier to spot clam beds; rake along the shoreline and wait for them to come to the top. Boil them in a pan over your camp fire and add a couple of dashes of sherry, then throw in some finely chopped onion, coriander and a bay leaf.</p> \n<p><strong>Samphire</strong><br />Look out for samphire on muddy flats around estuaries or tidal creeks. You can eat the young types now. Laver seaweed, the basis of Welsh laver bread, is another easy find. Boil it down then add a bit of seasoning, use olive oil and lemon juice.</p> \n<p><strong>Crabs</strong><br />You can either hunt in rockpools or use a crabbing line – near a jetty is good. Boil in salted seawater over your beach fire for around 20 minutes. Smash them up and eat with crusty bread and mayonnaise, with your feet in the water.</p> \n<p><strong>Prawns</strong><br />Find a jetty where there’s seaweed hanging down, get yourself a little net and just lie on the pontoon, scooping all the way along the weeds. Just boil them in some seawater or salt water. Lemon juice, mayonnaise and bread optional.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Recipe for steamed clams over seaweed</strong><br />1. Dig a shallow hole a little smaller than the width of your grill. Line with stones and light a fire to make your beach barbecue.</p> \n<p>2. Put a little water in a pan and heat over your barbecue.</p> \n<p>3. Place a bunch of seaweed – bladderwrack (black in colour with pods) is one of the most plentiful – in the pan so it covers the water.</p> \n<p>4. Lay your clams over the seaweed, ideally with some wild fennel if <br />it’s handy. </p> \n<p>5. Season, cover with foil and let the clams steam for 8-10 minutes. (This is even tastier made with white fish but mackerel is good too if you can catch any.) Best served with crisp white wine and a spicy slaw.<em><br />Words by Rosie Ifould.

Luxury for a little more than &pound;80 a night for two.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7ab08428f30c412f53b90b185c777db8beaae361\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434109083718/0f2d4ebf-9e0d-4fd5-8375-efc88a338b28-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A lounge area at the Aristi Mountain Resort\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A lounge area at the Aristi Mountain Resort</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The national park has smooth, empty roads, pristine hiking trails and traditional stone villages, many of which are home to good-value restaurants, B&amp;Bs and small hotels (from around €40 a night if you’re looking for a cheaper stay). Tourism has developed slowly and organically here, with strict regulation reining in excess and eyesores.</p> \n<p>My partner Adam and I spent the days hiking, or rafting down the Voidomatis, and the evenings on the hotel terrace, looking over the valley and watching the Astraka peaks turn pink and orange. Dinners included a €30 “tasting feast”, with foraged mushrooms, trout and smoked eel.</p> \n<p>In the 17th and 18th centuries, the villages were prosperous staging posts for Ottoman traders, and the paths they travelled are now ideal for hiking: routes between villages range from under two hours to all-day treks.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2ba5029b3178d2ef79d51cda020bcd3d4ca0d853\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434109293899/9aaa65ce-f681-4b56-bb3b-21d6e5c89812-460x299.jpeg\" alt=\"The river Vikos near Vitsa.\" width=\"460\" height=\"299\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The river Vikos near Vitsa.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Hellier/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Local company <a href=\"http://www.trekking.gr/sections/outdoor-holidays-in-greece\">Trekking Hellas</a> does guided or self-guided tours with rooms and meals.

Our favourite took us down a valley from Vikos to the source of the Voidomatis, then steeply up to the pretty village of Mikro Papigo, in around four hours. The walks are not circular, but some hotels offer drop-offs and pick-ups, and guesthouses can put hikers in touch with local drivers.</p> \n<p>One day we checked out the elegant stone bridges built by those Ottoman traders from the 17th century onwards. Kokkoros, soaring between natural limestone pillars, and the three-humped Plakidas bridge near Kipi, were particularly memorable. We spent another day driving between villages. In Monodendri, we parked in the square and walked for 10 minutes to 15th-century Saint Paraskevi monastery, built into the side of a gorge, where saints stare down from carefully restored frescos.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c09d82e1cdcc940eb487431b1abab905b7e817f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/12/1434108969020/aca94441-70de-4272-857f-b6f85d499eaa-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The three-arched Plakidas bridge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The three-arched Plakidas bridge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Hercules Milas/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The smell of roasting lamb tempted us into family-run Sta Risa taverna in Elati, where we gorged on <em>gigantes</em> – huge beans with spinach and tomato – warm bread, lamb chops, hand-cut fries strewn with thyme, and slow-roast lamb.

I’ll call them the Mystic East, the Dead Centre, and the Wild West. Most people flying to Faro will end up at the popular resort towns of the Dead Centre such as Vilamoura, Albufeira and Lagos, leaving a whole lot of Algarve relatively free of visitors. But if you do fetch up in such a resort, a 20-minute drive will deliver you to some of southern Europe’s most scented, empty countryside.</p> \n<p>Our Mystic East is the borderland. The Guadiana river separates the Algarve – where humility is regarded as a strength – from brasher Spain. Inland, it’s possible to meander for miles through enchanted valleys, hear birdsong, see few people and find peace. The east’s coastal margin is where the ocean is tamed by the sand islands, salt pans and azure lagoons of the Ria Formosa natural park, where flamingos and dolphins abound.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Map of the Algarve area of Portugal\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.guim.co.uk/ni/1434025757299/Travel_Algarve_WEB.svg&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot; /&gt;\"></iframe> \n <figcaption> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The central Algarve coastline has been relentlessly developed, but even here there are havens of old Portugal with its carob, fig and almond trees, where time treads softly and slowly and life’s pleasures are priced with locals in mind.</p> \n<p>To the Arabs who ruled here for the best part of 900 years, Al Gharb – “The West” – was the end of the world. Go west today and you’ll find wind-brushed cliff paths and superb swimming coves. Turn north at Cabo de S&atilde;o Vicente and there are miles of surf beaches, inland from which white villages huddle amid sheep-nibbled farms and ancient forests.</p> \n<p>With the Gulf of C&aacute;diz and the Atlantic beyond being among Europe’s most fertile marine areas, and a climate where mangoes and bananas thrive, visitors eat extremely well – and surprisingly cheaply – here. The Algarvian kitchen excels at honest, hearty dishes, and the local beers and wines from the region, and neighbouring Alentejo, are world-class and inexpensive.</p> \n<p>In recent years, a few smart visionaries have opened tiny hotels that succeed in being chic yet open-hearted and warm. Visitors staying at one of these will feel cared for – and lucky. So, with 300-plus days of sunshine, abundant budget flights, excellent roads and deep traditions of hospitality and affordability, the only question worth asking is: which Algarve to visit?</p> \n<h2><strong>THE EAST</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"053123bce1f2da9230752ca4922cd3d2316cd04f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434036330003/37dd2d5f-5e11-4bc8-a5ca-ad9d0fa9c709-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Ponte Romana across the Gilao river, Tavira.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Ponte Romana across the Gilao river, Tavira.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sabine Lubenow/JAI/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s worth heading inland to pretty Alcoutim for the drive alone. Cistus, wild orchids and house-high castor oil plants fringe the roadside. Alcoutim’s slim, cobbled streets tumble down to this gorgeous bend of the Guadiana with its peace and sandy river beaches. <strong>O Soeiro </strong>restaurant (4 Rua do Munic&iacute;pio, +351 281 546 241) opens out onto the adjoining church steps and riverside. It’s family-style and not fancy. The grilled chicken is heroic.<br /></p> \n<p>The Guadiana meets the sea at Vila Real de Santo Ant&oacute;nio. Elegant, once-wealthy and still popular with Spaniards perusing bargain household textiles, Vila Real is where the ferry chugs across to Ayamonte in Spain. Some 300 metres up the all-but-abandoned quayside from the ferry terminal is <strong>Tasquinha da Muralha</strong> (+351 963 267 265), a blue-and-white shack serving faultless grilled fish.</p> \n<p>Monte Gordo is a 1960s tourist town that need not detain us but, from here, there are beaches all the way to Faro. Praia do Cabe&ccedil;o is popular with clammers but also families and strollers, and runs from Monte Gordo to Manta Rota. The popular (and good) <strong>Sem Espinhas</strong> (+351 281 956 026, <a href=\"http://www.semespinhas.net/praiadocabeco.html\">semespinhas.net</a>) beach hangout will cook you lunch, sell you a lolly and/or get you tipsy.</p> \n<p>Once the home of 12th-century Sufi poets drunk on divine love, Cacela Velha is a jewel-like three-bar, two-restaurant seaside hamlet on a cliff top overlooking market gardens, oyster beds and inviting, strollable sandy islands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bbbdf533c4edde610977728ba288b72978af363b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037146930/a46a9db0-49f9-4b32-9f06-0dae8d6a62c6-460x205.jpeg\" alt=\"The beach at Cacela Velha.\" width=\"460\" height=\"205\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The beach at Cacela Velha.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Gould</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cabanas de Tavira was once a tuna fishery and is now a slow, low-rise village with the excellent <a href=\"https://pt-pt.facebook.com/noeliaejeronimorestaurante?rf=12992224708658\"><strong>No&eacute;lia e Jer&oacute;nimo</strong></a> (3 Rua da Fortaleza, +351 281 370 649). No&eacute;lia is a seriously good chef who serves updated Portuguese classics such as octopus fritters with coriander rice. Opposite is Cabanas island beach, which is reached by ferry (€1.30) in three minutes. If doing nothing is too much for you, Eolis (<a href=\"http://www.kitesurfeolis.com/\">kitesurfeolis.com</a>) will teach you kitesurfing … and that you’re not as young as you used to be.</p> \n<p>Tavira is slightly the victim of its own elegant loveliness: eating places abound, as do visitors. But its beach is a gem: Ilha da Tavira, only reachable by boat, has shops, cafes and a campsite. Ferries run to here from Tavira town, Cabanas de Tavira and Quatro &Aacute;guas.</p> \n<p>Between Tavira and the island is adorable Santa Luzia. This whitewashed fishing village is Portugal’s “capital of octopus”. Book ahead at <strong>Casa do Polvo Tasquinha</strong> (8 Avenida Engenheiro Duarte Pacheco, +351 281 328 527) for Nicole’s perfect chargrilled octopus. Walk lunch off at <strong>Praia Barril</strong> beach, reached on the vintage train (€1.30 each way) which deposits you at the beach cafe/shop complex. Like many eastern Algarve beaches, Barril is naturist-friendly.</p> \n<p>Still heading west, <strong>Marisqueira Fialho</strong> restaurant (Estr Vale Formoso, +351 281 961 222) is at Pinheiro, a tranquil shallow lagoon where visitors can stroll the marshes among the abundant bird life and soak up the sun on lonely sand bars. Fialho specialises in eel, fish and clam dishes, and much unforced Portuguese cheer.</p> \n<p>Fuzeta is a 1930s fishing/holiday town with another fabulous island beach. Splendid outdoor fish lunches, expertly grilled by Senhor Filipe, are yours for €10 a pop at <strong>A Lota </strong>(next to the fish market, Largo 1 de Maio, +351 289 794 860). An afternoon’s paddle and stroll along Fuzeta beach brings you to Armona and its ferries (<a href=\"http://www.olhao.web.pt/horariobarcos.htm\">olhao.web.pt</a>) to Olh&atilde;o.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b66fb244dc3586691e499d537fdb08006ee2c2cb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037046514/e2d7393d-a1f1-4bd9-940e-8614d282e426-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"A chapel in Culatra.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A chapel in Culatra.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kevin Gould</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The Algarve’s largest commercial port and its extensive clam beds make Olh&atilde;o a busy, living, salty place. Clam digger Alexander cooks (relatively) upscale dishes opposite the thriving, exciting market at <a href=\"https://pt-pt.facebook.com/pages/Sabores-Da-Ria/258474680879347\"><strong>Sabores da Ria</strong></a> (Pra&ccedil;a Patr&atilde;o Joachim Lopes, +351963479472), while <strong>Carlos and Helena</strong> (10 Rua Olhanense, +351 289 702 892) offers Helena’s pitch-perfect family cooking.</p> \n<p>The Ilha da Culatra can be reached by ferry from Olh&atilde;o. There’s sometimes a shack on its beach with drinks and sunloungers; the few folk who come here do so for solitude and its beautiful waters. By the jetty, friendly <strong>Caf&eacute; Janoca </strong>(meals from €15) will overfeed you with pleasure. Culatra is also a destination for <strong>Passeios Ria Formosa </strong>(<a href=\"http://www.passeios-ria-formosa.com/en/\">passeios-ria-formosa.com</a>) which operates tours and water taxis from Olh&atilde;o, Fuzeta, Santa Luzia and Cabanas de Tavira.</p> \n<h2>Where to stay</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"60bccb117d0cd1a84629f0cadb8ff7643f10254a\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434035732292/acaa85a6-0932-4577-9d33-209b954ac504-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"‘Sexy B&amp;B’ … the stylish Convento riad in Olh&atilde;o\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">‘Sexy B&amp;B’ … the stylish Convento riad in Olh&atilde;o</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>New this year, <strong>Convento</strong> (doubles from €80, 10 Travessa Antonio Bento, +351 911 970 167, <a href=\"http://conventoolhao.com/\">conventoolhao.com</a>) is a serene nine-room riad with a rooftop pool in the heart of Olh&atilde;o’s medina.

Faro is a thriving university town with a pretty centre: find fun and alfresco drinks and snacks at <a href=\"http://www.barcolumbus.pt/\"><strong>Bar Columbus</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Jardim Manuel Bivar).</p> \n<p>The hills behind and beyond Faro offer many a sturdy dinner. In an old dairy in the village of Machados, near S&atilde;o Br&aacute;s de Alportel, <strong>Adega Nunes </strong>(+351 289 842 506) offers home cooking and homemade firewater digestifs. Another happy place to lose an afternoon in is <strong>Lagar da Mesquita</strong> (Mesquita Baixa 315A, +351 289 845 809), a restaurant in an old oil press in the hamlet of Mesquita.</p> \n<p>Paderne is a sweet village nine miles inland from Albufeira with two great restaurants: <a href=\"http://www.restauranteveneza.com/en/\"><strong>Veneza</strong></a><strong> </strong>(560A Estrada de Paderne, +351 289 367 129) with its renowned cellar, and <a href=\"http://restaurantexerem.com/\"><strong>Xer&eacute;m</strong></a> (Estrada Ferreiras,+351 289 543 141), famous for <em>xer&eacute;m</em> – Portugal’s polenta.

After a hard week at work, isn’t that precisely what you want from a weekend away? You need a place to retreat, de-stress and regroup. You need Tudor Farmhouse.</p> \n<p>“Ask people around here if they’re from England or Wales and they’ll say Forest,” said owner Colin Fell, as we motored from Lydney station through the Forest of Dean. This somewhat isolated enclave – above Bristol and the river Severn, almost Wales, not quite the Cotswolds – remains relatively unknown. Outdoorsy types come to get muddy in the Wye Valley, and history buffs love Tintern Abbey and Raglan Castle, but the area lacks the picturesque, ivy-clad villages that would attract day-trippers.</p> \n<p>The village of Clearwell is evidently an exception. Bathed in evening sunlight, it felt like the set of a Richard Curtis film, with its old stone buildings, minimal traffic and strangers saying hello. It is tiny, but there are country walks in every direction, several nooks to explore (a grotto-like well, its Gothic revival castle) and, importantly, two village pubs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ced393023128b124d9b94bc0b7766752c849b1e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434036566927/b6255db6-47c7-48da-96aa-945bcd766f23-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Bedroom at Tudor farmhouse\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Tudor Farmhouse is a collection of 16th-century stone buildings, with a courtyard garden, orchard, allotments and free-range hens. It is a ridiculously pretty spot, but, internally, the rugged character of these handsome buildings is allowed to shine. There are floors so uneven you feel drunk walking on them, ancient winding staircases, huge grates now housing wood-burning stoves, and medieval panelling, doors and beams. Its 20 bedrooms (many were refurbished over the winter) are restrained in their neat greige decor. Throughout, there is a pleasing lack of clutter and cottagey cuteness.<br /></p> \n<p>My entry-level “hatchling” room (all are named after chicken sizes, except the suites) was compact but smooth-functioning – tiny niggles aside (slightly fiddly Velux window, small wine crates for bedside tables). The space has been used intelligently and has everything you need, from a full-length mirror to homemade shortbread. The detail (wooden hangers, duckdown pillows, fresh milk) was sound. I liked the clear TV instructions and the one-click Wi-Fi. It all just worked. The staff were, likewise, warm but well-drilled.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ed477282c8babd7164685c45b67d5af4dd603cd\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434036630592/ca18579c-ab02-4c79-8a57-18a67bd4e661-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Restaurant at Tudor\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The hotel’s restaurant is the final redoubt, a cocoon of tea lights, exposed stone and leaded windows. After an aperitif of white wine from a <a href=\"http://www.parvafarm.com/\">vineyard in nearby Tintern Parva </a>(spritzy and enjoyable) or a beer from local Hillside Brewery (excellent), real life will seem very remote.</p> \n<p>There was the odd fault, most notably an over-reduced meat jus that was more like glue, but generally chef Martin Adams’s food is technically adept and his flavours ring true. His dish design needs greater discipline, however. White chocolate was an interesting garnish for mackerel (like salted chocolate), but jarred with the accompanying pickled beetroot. The dish didn’t need both. Likewise, in its individual components, a main course of calf’s liver and 72-day aged brisket was impressive but, texturally, the two meats were not complementary. It felt like I had two competing, if tasty, dishes on the same plate.</p> \n<p>Well-fed nonetheless, I toddled off to bed and fell asleep to a soundtrack of bleating lambs. Next morning, after breakfast (a quality spread), it was back to grim reality, joining the commuters at Lydney station.
