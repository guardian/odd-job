Escaping the reach of the city usually involved a long trek on a bus. My one salvation was Tres Bocas – an island in the Rio Paran&aacute; delta. It only entailed a short train journey to Tigre, and a 40-minute boat ride (about &pound;8).</p> \n<p>Each year, on my return to Argentina with my family, I still head here. The island’s main restaurant and only shop is El Hornero, astride a small tributary, a short amble along a mud track from the landing bay. We usually sit outside in the courtyard, under the welcome shade of a giant wisteria and savour the alchemy of smoke and meat being grilled.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"356a0ca85b83fba44c5fd3674caed15587973413\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435145668942/d0a735f7-bd6d-4734-b2ff-8a6240c1f970-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"El Hornero, Tres Bocas Island, Panama Delta, Buenos Aires\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">El Hornero, Tres Bocas Island.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Daughton</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/feb/17/tigre-delta-argentina-buenos-aires-kayak-barbecue\">Barbecue joints and a boho vibe in the Tigre delta, Argentina</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The food is nothing fancy – the usual Argentinian suspects of chorizo, <em>morcilla</em> (blood sausage), <em>vacio</em> (flank), <em>entrańa</em> (skirt) – but it’s well executed and cheap too, about &pound;10 a head. The alfesco setting enhances the eating experience (there’s no interior just a small grocer shop) and we arrive hungry. Having eaten long and well, we sit back under the cool, dappled light and polish off the remaining malbec, while the kids scamper off, ice-creams in hand, to explore the island.</p> \n<p>Though only an hour away, the bustle and grind of the city seem a distant prospect. The only sound that might break the tranquillity is the distant chug of a boat or the hiss of the <em>cigarras</em> (crickets). The waters gurgle past and the late-afternoon light slants through the birch trees. For now, for this short while, all is fine.</p>","section":"Travel","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435145343912/7cef43d0-3be3-4358-b480-f804b9cefd15-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"M G Therin Weise/Getty Images","altText":"Tigre, Paraná Delta, Argentina.

Inside this huge wooden drum, dashing black-clad chaps on motorbikes go full throttle so they can cling to its vertical walls. “Look!” shouts the spieler, “side-saddle riding with no hands!”</p> \n<p>At the height of its popularity in the 1960s, when it attracted more than two million thrill-seekers a year, Dreamland boasted a wall of death run by legendary stunt motorcyclist Yvonne Stagg. I never knew it firsthand, only through Lindsay Anderson’s unsettling 1953 documentary film, O Dreamland, with its terrifying animatronic electric chair and Haunted Snail ride.</p> \n<p>The park closed, seemingly forever, in 2003, but here it is, a candy-striped phoenix, saved from being turned over to featureless residential properties by the indomitable energies of The Dreamland Trust, aided by a dramatic CPO by Thanet District Council and, now, private backing. The Grade II-listed scenic railway, devastated by an arson attack in 2008, has been rebuilt, wooden slat by wooden slat, back to its rickety, grinding glory. Though sadly, the restoration wasn’t finished quite in time for opening last weekend.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84c3d2ca05ce7b092f2ec2ce7701f94da457ae6c\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063380541/d31ef1a5-f277-46f4-8a8b-89899099d2ec-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Messhams Wall of Death\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Defying gravity … Messhams Wall of Death provides traditional thrills</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>On my first visit, I go along with Rob Ball, a photographer who has created a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/artanddesign/gallery/2015/jun/08/margate-dreamland-amusement-park-tintype-photographs-in-pictures\">series of haunting, tintype photographs of the park during its transition</a>. He knew it in the late 1990s when it was “more like a travelling fair, everything seemed temporary and a bit broken. It was like Margate at the time – lacking any kind of energy”.</p> \n<p>Energy it now has in spades. The staff, in their vintage Levi’s 501s, denim overalls and jaunty 1950s-style bandanas – are bursting with sugar-rush enthusiasm. Their T-shirts bellow fairground-speak: “Scream if you want to go faster”, “Hands in the air”, “We cater for pleasure”, a riff on the original strapline, Pleasure Without Measure. My first teenage, um, stirrings took place on the waltzers, and I’m delighted to see that the long-haired, tattooed ride-wrangler aesthetic is still in place, even if it’s softened by the seaside rock palette. More than 200 new jobs have been created, mostly for locals: Dreamland is already contributing significantly to Margate’s steady revival.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457255339__\n</div> \n<p>One entrance is via the imposing, brick-fronted building, off the seafront parade of arcades and pubs and the striking, fin-fronted art deco cinema. This brings you past The Emporium, bristling with superior souvenirs, many designed by local artists, such as <a href=\"http://www.zoemurphy.com/\">Zoe Murphy</a> and <a href=\"http://www.keithbrymerjones.com/537/about-keith-brymer-jones\">Keith Brymer Jones</a>. There’s also retro furniture from <a href=\"http://junkdeluxe.co.uk/\">Junk Deluxe</a>, including decorative items crafted from pieces of the original scenic railway. You’re immediately in the heart of the hubbub: a glorious tin-tiled ceiling left in decoratively peeling state soars over roller-disco, bar, acres of neon – including a wonderful artwork by Ramsgate-based artist <a href=\"http://www.rachelwilberforce.com/\">Rachel Wilberforce</a> – and banks of original pinball machines. You can also go in via an entrance under the rollercoaster – I can only imagine how exciting this will be when the cars are rumbling above your head.</p> \n<p>Once, Dreamland was at the cutting edge of fairground excitement. But now it has a whole other agenda: rather than competing with the high-tech thrills of Alton Towers and Thorpe Park, it offers a gentle, sweetly retro vision of seaside fun masterminded by designer <a href=\"http://houseofhemingway.co.uk/hemingway-design/projects/dreamland/\">Wayne Hemingway</a>. Old rides have been refurbished, old fairground paraphernalia upcycled. But your hair will still be raised: 17 rides are currently open, more than enough for a day out, ranging from the vintage galloper merry-go-round, its handsome, brightly painted steeds performing a stately dance, to the hectic, waltzer-meets-rollercoaster swoops of the Crazy Mouse which has us screaming like hopped-up teenagers.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62b7a4aa9c2815cc1480c513269787db2954a0a6\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435063878076/583de9ec-a223-453c-815f-0e2b6c5592bc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Dreamland helter-skelter\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dreamland is not aiming to compete with the likes of hi-tech Thorpe Park and Alton Towers</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Design is a huge part of it: you don’t need to notice that the teacups ride has been painted by a Wedgewood artist in classic Jasperware style – but with cultural icons from mods and rockers to new romantics. Or that the original dodgems have been repainted with David Bowie and Chuck Berry. But if you do, it adds an extra layer of pleasure.</p> \n<p>It costs &pound;14.95 for a pre-booked daily ticket (&pound;17.95 on the day), a price that has caused some local chuntering. My friend Jane remembers hanging out there every Saturday evening when entry was free, you only had to pay for rides. “As a 14-year-old, it was the only place to go – in all senses.” But I think the pricing is fair: your daily wristband allows you to go in and out as you please. So you can take time out for art at the <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/\">Turner Contemporary</a>, or to mooch round the indie shops of the Old Town – some of which, like vintage clothes specialist <a href=\"http://www.madampopoff.com/\">Madam Popoff</a>, are capitalising on Dreamland’s arrival by offering discounts to customers with wristbands.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b2df334c18f549fc16caffb44b929407f6659e02\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/23/1435064170608/0a93940f-fbef-49d1-8c28-3ed971d8d22d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The careful restoration of old arcade games has been part of Dreamland's redevelopment.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The careful restoration of old arcade games has been part of Dreamland’s redevelopment.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Stothard/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The one element that’s not floating my swing boat is the food. The food court looks attractive, fringed by herb-filled planters made from more reclaimed rollercoaster. But the only local presences I detect are <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/yamasmargate?fref=nf\">Yama’s Thai</a> (closed during our visit) and <a href=\"http://propercoffeehouse.co.uk/\">Proper Coffee</a>. Despite being served from a gleaming Airstream caravan, my cheeseburger is last century in a bad way: greasy, a stranger to quality meat products, topped with sweaty cheese. At &pound;4.50, it’s not cheap – and it nearly makes a second appearance after one too many turns on the dizzying Chair-O-Planes. I’m not sure, either, why the (expensive) ice-cream concession is by the Cotswold-based <a href=\"http://www.marshfield-icecream.co.uk/\">Marshfield Farm</a> when there’s the likes of <a href=\"http://www.morellisgelato.com/heritage\">Morelli’s</a>, which was founded in Broadstairs, nearby. So on my second visit, I use my wristband to trot out to newly opened <a href=\"http://www.hantverk-found.co.uk/\">Hantverk &amp; Found</a> (18 King St), a tiny seafood cafe and gallery, for gorgeous local seafood dishes and a clever winelist. It’s great to see outside tables at <a href=\"http://greatbritishpizza.com/margate-contact-us/\">GB Pizza</a> (14A Marine Drive) and <a href=\"http://bebeached.co.uk/\">BeBeached</a> (Harbour Arm) mobbed, too.</p> \n<p>But this is early days, phase one of four, promising over the next couple of years everything from a “fine dining” restaurant to the revival of the cinema and ballroom. The mood is fantastic: upbeat, from a crowd of older locals reliving their youth to cool young thangs attracted by Margate’s burgeoning reputation as Dalston-sur-Mer; fiftysomething men in braces and Harringtons, candy-floss-chomping teens… People are picnicking on the fake lawn beside the hair and beauty caravan, children gyrating newly bought hula-hoops to the strains of I’ve Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts. Elsewhere, drag queens in Hi-de-Hi! outfits groove to Blondie by the original 1940s toy car circuit, and a magician enthrals a crowd by the helter-skelter. Yes, there’s still work to be done.

In between Kanye West and Florence and the Machine, visitors will flock to food trucks and portable pubs, with around 500 traders due to set up stall on the festival site and more than 100 licensed premises. </p> \n<p>These small businesses have a captive audience. Each visitor spent more than &pound;466 on average at independent music festivals in 2014 (including the ticket price), according to<a href=\"http://aiforg.com/wp-content/uploads/AIF-Six-Year-Report-2014.pdf\"> research</a> from the Association of Independent Music Festivals (AIF). </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It isn’t just a bunch of stalls burning incense now as it was in the mid-nineties!</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Paul Reed, AIF</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The festival season is a huge marketing opportunity, too, and can provide a launch pad for small businesses. Cult London restaurant MEATliquor, for example, was first sampled at festivals. Paul Reed, general manager at <a href=\"http://aiforg.com/\">AIF</a>, says: “A presence at festivals can greatly enhance your brand. It isn’t just a bunch of stalls burning incense now as it was in the mid-nineties.”<br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.chunkychipswickeddips.co.uk/\">Chunky Chips,Wicked Dips</a> is one small business that has been increasing its festival appearances year-on-year. Steve Lavell and Jono Rich started the business six years ago while struggling to find jobs after university. Since then, they’ve picked up slots at nearly every festival, including Glastonbury, <a href=\"http://www.secretgardenparty.com/\">Secret Garden Party</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bestival.net/\">Bestival</a> on the Isle of Wight, and <a href=\"http://www.readingfestival.com/\">Reading</a>. Lavell says: “Word spreads rapidly at festivals and we get return custom.” </p> \n<p>Lavell admits it can be tough to get into bigger festivals as a small trader – to win a pitch at Glastonbury they were competing with 3000 other enterprises. Selling at festivals isn’t cheap, either. It cost &pound;10,000 for their pitch at Latitude, which had to be paid several months in advance. But the &pound;19,000 made in sales alleviated the cost. </p> \n<p>The pitching process for most festivals begins the previous autumn. Lavell says their festival calendar starts in October, when the Glastonbury online applications open (they close in December). Most festival applications shut by March, with around a month for the selected businesses to complete the documentation and pay for the pitch. For Glastonbury this is sped up, with a week’s turnaround.<br /></p> \n<p>Organising stock is another thing to consider. Chunky Chips, Wicked Dips have all stock delivered to the site on the first day and store it in vans. At Glastonbury, they’ve got two, which are big enough to hold all the ingredients for the four days. By trial and error, Lavell and Rich have a good idea of how much they’ll sell and rarely have stock left over. <br /></p> \n<p>Lavell says: “We have a small menu, which makes it easier to feed the masses. It’s about getting a happy medium of quantity and quality.” </p> \n<p>Lavell reckons Bestival is the most profitable festival for his business. “It’s the most fun to sell at,” he adds. This year, Bestival has chosen Chunky Chips, Wicked Dips as one of a small number of traders organisers expect to earn the most. This means Lavell and Rich will be given pitches in the most popular areas of the site. As part of this arrangement, the organisers take a 28% cut of the business profits. Lavell says they are happy with this, given the better chance of sales. Typically, the cut taken by festival organisers ranges from 25-30%. </p> \n<p>With this in mind, they have to keep tight tabs on their annual budget, with most of the earnings coming in over the summer and pitch fees paid well in advance. But, they also sell at winter events. Last year they won a contract to sell at a fireworks display at Alexandra Palace as well as darts and ice rink events.<br /></p> \n<p>A traditional pitch isn’t the only way to catch the attention of festival goers. There are other marketing opportunities for canny entrepreneurs.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cf05070af0458bfb3fc84cbb642ccfacf184f39\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434727754809/03c15e3c-7cb0-4510-954e-5e24e55bde68-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"women at festival\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the MOA team at Secret Garden Party last year.

Cosmetics brand <a href=\"http://www.moa.london/pages/beauty\">MOA</a>, which sells herbal skin care products, has teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.wildwellbeing.co.uk/\">Wild Wellbeing</a>, which runs massage stalls at festivals. Wild Wellbeing used MOA’s products in the massages, promoting them to its customers.</p> \n<p>MOA is sponsoring all Wild Wellbeing’s on-site massages at <a href=\"http://www.greenman.net/\">Green Man </a>festival this year. It’s also the first time MOA staff have a pitch to sell products from. To encourage passers by to make a pit stop, they’ll be offering craft activities, such as making flower headbands.<br /></p> \n<p>Charlie Fowler, creative and managing director at MOA, says: “We’re quite a niche brand – but we find the right type of customer at festivals.” She says it is hard to judge benefit of festivals in terms of sales, but thinks it helps to build MOA’s image. “People reach out to us after they’ve seen the brand at a particular festival,” she says. </p> \n<p>Reed says independent festivals, such as Green Man, allow small business to be creative in their promotional approach. “The best kind of marketing doesn’t feel at all like marketing,” he adds. “I’m not sure that such partnerships would be as possible at huge commercial events.”</p> \n<p>However, Reed points out that 30% of festival-goers in 2014 were 17-24 years old, so visitors’ age and spending power should be considered before signing up. <br /></p> \n<p>Barry Tiffen has 25 years of experience of selling at festivals with his vegetarian food stall, <a href=\"http://www.mobileveggiefood.co.uk/\">Goodness Gracious Healthy Foods</a>, which was named concession of the year at the UK Festival Awards last year. He says bigger festivals are less worthwhile for traders, with the exception of Glastonbury. “You can make a good living [there]. It attracts middle class people who have money to spend and there’s an range of age groups.” He says this is preferable to the younger demographic of Reading or Leeds, who tend to skimp on healthy food.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It helps to build relationship with our customers. And we have some good reviews on our website through festivals.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Charlie Fowler, MOA</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Reed agrees: “It’s not necessarily a numbers game in terms of footfall. That doesn’t matter if everyone is walking past your stall but not engaging. Its about reaching the right audience.”<br /></p> \n<p>Fowler thinks targeting such customers helps to boost MOA’s online profile. “It’s really effective in terms of social returns. When someone meets you, or encounters your product at a festival, they might ‘like’ you on Facebook, or interact with you on Twitter. It helps to build relationship with our customers. And we have some good reviews on our website through festivals.”<br /></p> \n<p>While festivals can be a marketing boon, they require a lot of organisation and there are nitty gritty aspects to take into account, including health and safety regulations.<br /></p> \n<p>Reed says: “It’s important for organisers to have all of their licensing requirements, insurance and health and safety procedures in place.” He adds that, for food traders, the caterers association (NCASS) has launched an online<a href=\"http://www.ncass.org.uk/eho-area/ncass-connect\"> hub</a> demonstrating due diligence and documentation. “There isn’t something similar for non-food traders, but there should be,” he adds. “It’s something we are looking at.”</p> \n<p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>","section":"Guardian Small Business Network","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434727396590/f8ccfcb2-390a-42d8-bb37-da32263db850-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ian Gavan/Getty Images","altText":"festival goers in front of glastonbury sign","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434727755314/67b36c63-64da-4e27-b054-fac26d898b5e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Some of the MOA team at Secret Garden Party last year.

As we drove through the village of Edington for the third time, past the impressive 14th-century church – again – I was starting to feel mild panic that the reverse would happen: we would never arrive at the Three Daggers. Wiltshire, with its ancient stones and its crop circles, is known for mysteries, but this was getting ridiculous. We found it on our fourth tour of the village – as three locals told us, you can’t miss it.</p> \n<p>The Three Daggers is a 200-year-old village inn that had been set for conversion into residential use. But Chad Pike, an American property developer and owner of nearby Priory Farm, bought it and revitalised the tired interior with all the classic markers of the modern pub: slate floor, zinc bar, wood-burners, old black and white photos. That was in 2010. Two years later, three guestrooms, a microbrewery and a farm shop were added, and there are plans for more rooms across the road. The latest addition is the “beer bus”, a jazzed-up Citroen H van that will tour festivals selling Daggers ales. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"769d97da8434f31bbc4a59373b75e6478f099746\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434642052372/cf5da6ff-5dec-4c58-bf60-8f57932de69c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Three Daggers, Wiltshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 200-year-old pub was redeveloped by the American owner of a nearby farm</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After my visit I came across a scathing report in the Daily Mail accusing Pike of turning the village into an olde England theme park for his rich American pals. But I find it very hard to believe that the village is ever overrun with Yanks squawking over the quaint cottages. In fact, what I liked most about the Daggers was the atmosphere: there was a genuine sense of conviviality in the bar, which was full of locals, including half the Erlestoke and Coulston cricket club, celebrating a win by ordering four-litre jugs of cider.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the cricket players had got over the novelty of drinking the pub’s own beer. In the pristine brewery next door, brewers Michael Andrews and Andrew King produce four ales of between 2.8% and 4.7% ABV, as well as stouts and some specials. At the bar, we tried samples of all four regulars while our five-year-old son eyed the glass jars of sweets. At dinner, eaten in the bright conservatory, my sea bass and my other half’s burger were good but the macaroni cheese from the kids’ menu was the standout dish.</p> \n<p>In fact, the pub proved a big hit all round for our son, who darted about the playground in the adjoining field while we sat in the pub garden. Above the pub, via a separate entrance, the three guestrooms share a living room with TV, board games and kitchen area stocked with cereals, juice and milk so we could feed him first thing, before breakfast was served downstairs.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"abad2e1bb1a4c2f12c270f0ce5d24f87dd9dc5e4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434641909769/28f654d6-ef4d-483e-8d41-29ed8ea39fa3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Village cricketers celebrate a victory at The Three Daggers’ beer bus\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Village cricketers celebrate a victory at The Three Daggers’ beer bus</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The decor in the living room and bedrooms is pared back and subtly stylish, with natural carpet, white walls, canvas prints of local landscapes and cream brick tiles in the bathrooms. A spare child’s bed had been made up, although the huge double bed was easily big enough for the three of us.</p> \n<p>After breakfast, I spent a good half-hour nosing around the excellent farm shop, stocking up on bottles of ale, but resisting the temptation to invest in a two-litre flagon. By the time I’d paid, the team were busy setting up for a barbecue and we were in danger of going from eggs and bacon to burgers in less than an hour.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ebf391ab53d8798665ff0ad486b7707bf5ecf591\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434642339435/85604ebe-d5c8-49fa-9324-e93ee8dcedb1-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hearty fare at The Three Daggers\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Three Daggers’ restaurant</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>We hopped in the car and drove 10 minutes to Salisbury Plain for a blustery walk around Bratton Camp iron age hill fort and its white horse – now concreted over to preserve it – as paragliders swooped in the sky above.

Its two sides, Buda and Pest, were separate cities until 1873, and they retain their own distinct identities, the former run through with ancient history, the latter noisier, earthier and more cosmopolitan. In Buda you’ll find royal palaces, Ottoman-era spas and wooded hills, while over in Pest you can pore over a clutch of fine museums, fantastic art nouveau buildings and a resurgent Jewish quarter.</p> \n<p>At any time of year, Budapest has myriad charms, but nothing beats gazing out across the broad sweep of the Danube from the Castle District on a sultry summer’s evening. It is at this time, too, that open-air bars and pavement cafes do roaring trade, and restaurants go alfresco – indeed, Budapest’s gastronomic renaissance is one of the most exciting developments to hit the city in recent times.

Locals tend to head upstairs for a no-frills, canteen-style lunch at <a href=\"http://www.fakanaletterem.hu/en/\"><strong>Fakan&aacute;l</strong></a>, or just make for one of the many stalls selling <em>l&aacute;ngos</em>, a delicious, doughy, deep-fried flatbread topped with sour cream and cheese. <br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>V&aacute;mh&aacute;z krt 1-3, open 6am-6pm (3pm Saturday), closed Sunday</em></p> \n<p><strong>Borkonyha<br /></strong>Budapest has four Michelin-starred restaurants, and this one is the most convivial and reasonably priced.
