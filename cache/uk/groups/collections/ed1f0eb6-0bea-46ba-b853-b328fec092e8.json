In between Kanye West and Florence and the Machine, visitors will flock to food trucks and portable pubs, with around 500 traders due to set up stall on the festival site and more than 100 licensed premises. </p> \n<p>These small businesses have a captive audience. Each visitor spent more than &pound;466 on average at independent music festivals in 2014 (including the ticket price), according to<a href=\"http://aiforg.com/wp-content/uploads/AIF-Six-Year-Report-2014.pdf\"> research</a> from the Association of Independent Music Festivals (AIF). </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It isn’t just a bunch of stalls burning incense now as it was in the mid-nineties!</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Paul Reed, AIF</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>The festival season is a huge marketing opportunity, too, and can provide a launch pad for small businesses. Cult London restaurant MEATliquor, for example, was first sampled at festivals. Paul Reed, general manager at <a href=\"http://aiforg.com/\">AIF</a>, says: “A presence at festivals can greatly enhance your brand. It isn’t just a bunch of stalls burning incense now as it was in the mid-nineties.”<br /></p> \n<p><a href=\"http://www.chunkychipswickeddips.co.uk/\">Chunky Chips,Wicked Dips</a> is one small business that has been increasing its festival appearances year-on-year. Steve Lavell and Jono Rich started the business six years ago while struggling to find jobs after university. Since then, they’ve picked up slots at nearly every festival, including Glastonbury, <a href=\"http://www.secretgardenparty.com/\">Secret Garden Party</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bestival.net/\">Bestival</a> on the Isle of Wight, and <a href=\"http://www.readingfestival.com/\">Reading</a>. Lavell says: “Word spreads rapidly at festivals and we get return custom.” </p> \n<p>Lavell admits it can be tough to get into bigger festivals as a small trader – to win a pitch at Glastonbury they were competing with 3000 other enterprises. Selling at festivals isn’t cheap, either. It cost &pound;10,000 for their pitch at Latitude, which had to be paid several months in advance. But the &pound;19,000 made in sales alleviated the cost. </p> \n<p>The pitching process for most festivals begins the previous autumn. Lavell says their festival calendar starts in October, when the Glastonbury online applications open (they close in December). Most festival applications shut by March, with around a month for the selected businesses to complete the documentation and pay for the pitch. For Glastonbury this is sped up, with a week’s turnaround.<br /></p> \n<p>Organising stock is another thing to consider. Chunky Chips, Wicked Dips have all stock delivered to the site on the first day and store it in vans. At Glastonbury, they’ve got two, which are big enough to hold all the ingredients for the four days. By trial and error, Lavell and Rich have a good idea of how much they’ll sell and rarely have stock left over. <br /></p> \n<p>Lavell says: “We have a small menu, which makes it easier to feed the masses. It’s about getting a happy medium of quantity and quality.” </p> \n<p>Lavell reckons Bestival is the most profitable festival for his business. “It’s the most fun to sell at,” he adds. This year, Bestival has chosen Chunky Chips, Wicked Dips as one of a small number of traders organisers expect to earn the most. This means Lavell and Rich will be given pitches in the most popular areas of the site. As part of this arrangement, the organisers take a 28% cut of the business profits. Lavell says they are happy with this, given the better chance of sales. Typically, the cut taken by festival organisers ranges from 25-30%. </p> \n<p>With this in mind, they have to keep tight tabs on their annual budget, with most of the earnings coming in over the summer and pitch fees paid well in advance. But, they also sell at winter events. Last year they won a contract to sell at a fireworks display at Alexandra Palace as well as darts and ice rink events.<br /></p> \n<p>A traditional pitch isn’t the only way to catch the attention of festival goers. There are other marketing opportunities for canny entrepreneurs.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7cf05070af0458bfb3fc84cbb642ccfacf184f39\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434727754809/03c15e3c-7cb0-4510-954e-5e24e55bde68-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"women at festival\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Some of the MOA team at Secret Garden Party last year.

Cosmetics brand <a href=\"http://www.moa.london/pages/beauty\">MOA</a>, which sells herbal skin care products, has teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.wildwellbeing.co.uk/\">Wild Wellbeing</a>, which runs massage stalls at festivals. Wild Wellbeing used MOA’s products in the massages, promoting them to its customers.</p> \n<p>MOA is sponsoring all Wild Wellbeing’s on-site massages at <a href=\"http://www.greenman.net/\">Green Man </a>festival this year. It’s also the first time MOA staff have a pitch to sell products from. To encourage passers by to make a pit stop, they’ll be offering craft activities, such as making flower headbands.<br /></p> \n<p>Charlie Fowler, creative and managing director at MOA, says: “We’re quite a niche brand – but we find the right type of customer at festivals.” She says it is hard to judge benefit of festivals in terms of sales, but thinks it helps to build MOA’s image. “People reach out to us after they’ve seen the brand at a particular festival,” she says. </p> \n<p>Reed says independent festivals, such as Green Man, allow small business to be creative in their promotional approach. “The best kind of marketing doesn’t feel at all like marketing,” he adds. “I’m not sure that such partnerships would be as possible at huge commercial events.”</p> \n<p>However, Reed points out that 30% of festival-goers in 2014 were 17-24 years old, so visitors’ age and spending power should be considered before signing up. <br /></p> \n<p>Barry Tiffen has 25 years of experience of selling at festivals with his vegetarian food stall, <a href=\"http://www.mobileveggiefood.co.uk/\">Goodness Gracious Healthy Foods</a>, which was named concession of the year at the UK Festival Awards last year. He says bigger festivals are less worthwhile for traders, with the exception of Glastonbury. “You can make a good living [there]. It attracts middle class people who have money to spend and there’s an range of age groups.” He says this is preferable to the younger demographic of Reading or Leeds, who tend to skimp on healthy food.<br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>It helps to build relationship with our customers. And we have some good reviews on our website through festivals.</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Charlie Fowler, MOA</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Reed agrees: “It’s not necessarily a numbers game in terms of footfall. That doesn’t matter if everyone is walking past your stall but not engaging. Its about reaching the right audience.”<br /></p> \n<p>Fowler thinks targeting such customers helps to boost MOA’s online profile. “It’s really effective in terms of social returns. When someone meets you, or encounters your product at a festival, they might ‘like’ you on Facebook, or interact with you on Twitter. It helps to build relationship with our customers. And we have some good reviews on our website through festivals.”<br /></p> \n<p>While festivals can be a marketing boon, they require a lot of organisation and there are nitty gritty aspects to take into account, including health and safety regulations.<br /></p> \n<p>Reed says: “It’s important for organisers to have all of their licensing requirements, insurance and health and safety procedures in place.” He adds that, for food traders, the caterers association (NCASS) has launched an online<a href=\"http://www.ncass.org.uk/eho-area/ncass-connect\"> hub</a> demonstrating due diligence and documentation. “There isn’t something similar for non-food traders, but there should be,” he adds. “It’s something we are looking at.”</p> \n<p><strong>Sign up to become a member of the Guardian Small Business Network </strong><a href=\"https://register.theguardian.com/small-business/\"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> for more advice, insight and best practice direct to your inbox.</strong></p>","section":"Guardian Small Business Network","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434727396590/f8ccfcb2-390a-42d8-bb37-da32263db850-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Ian Gavan/Getty Images","altText":"festival goers in front of glastonbury sign","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434727755314/67b36c63-64da-4e27-b054-fac26d898b5e-1020x612.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Some of the MOA team at Secret Garden Party last year.

As we drove through the village of Edington for the third time, past the impressive 14th-century church – again – I was starting to feel mild panic that the reverse would happen: we would never arrive at the Three Daggers. Wiltshire, with its ancient stones and its crop circles, is known for mysteries, but this was getting ridiculous. We found it on our fourth tour of the village – as three locals told us, you can’t miss it.</p> \n<p>The Three Daggers is a 200-year-old village inn that had been set for conversion into residential use. But Chad Pike, an American property developer and owner of nearby Priory Farm, bought it and revitalised the tired interior with all the classic markers of the modern pub: slate floor, zinc bar, wood-burners, old black and white photos. That was in 2010. Two years later, three guestrooms, a microbrewery and a farm shop were added, and there are plans for more rooms across the road. The latest addition is the “beer bus”, a jazzed-up Citroen H van that will tour festivals selling Daggers ales. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"769d97da8434f31bbc4a59373b75e6478f099746\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434642052372/cf5da6ff-5dec-4c58-bf60-8f57932de69c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Three Daggers, Wiltshire\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The 200-year-old pub was redeveloped by the American owner of a nearby farm</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>After my visit I came across a scathing report in the Daily Mail accusing Pike of turning the village into an olde England theme park for his rich American pals. But I find it very hard to believe that the village is ever overrun with Yanks squawking over the quaint cottages. In fact, what I liked most about the Daggers was the atmosphere: there was a genuine sense of conviviality in the bar, which was full of locals, including half the Erlestoke and Coulston cricket club, celebrating a win by ordering four-litre jugs of cider.</p> \n<p>Perhaps the cricket players had got over the novelty of drinking the pub’s own beer. In the pristine brewery next door, brewers Michael Andrews and Andrew King produce four ales of between 2.8% and 4.7% ABV, as well as stouts and some specials. At the bar, we tried samples of all four regulars while our five-year-old son eyed the glass jars of sweets. At dinner, eaten in the bright conservatory, my sea bass and my other half’s burger were good but the macaroni cheese from the kids’ menu was the standout dish.</p> \n<p>In fact, the pub proved a big hit all round for our son, who darted about the playground in the adjoining field while we sat in the pub garden.

Its two sides, Buda and Pest, were separate cities until 1873, and they retain their own distinct identities, the former run through with ancient history, the latter noisier, earthier and more cosmopolitan. In Buda you’ll find royal palaces, Ottoman-era spas and wooded hills, while over in Pest you can pore over a clutch of fine museums, fantastic art nouveau buildings and a resurgent Jewish quarter.</p> \n<p>At any time of year, Budapest has myriad charms, but nothing beats gazing out across the broad sweep of the Danube from the Castle District on a sultry summer’s evening. It is at this time, too, that open-air bars and pavement cafes do roaring trade, and restaurants go alfresco – indeed, Budapest’s gastronomic renaissance is one of the most exciting developments to hit the city in recent times. Throw in a flourish of new design hotels, fabulous food markets and venerable coffee houses, and it adds up to one of the continent’s most enticing summer city breaks.</p> \n<h2>What to do</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0585caea959a7b3ff0c251744ffa8884d11a9766\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636152343/0977a1f5-f3e4-478b-8d28-57ef884e3e26-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"People soaking in the waters of the the Gellert Baths.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People soaking in the waters of the the Gellert Baths.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Thermal baths</strong><br />It’s inconceivable, in this city of spas, that you’d leave without taking to the waters, as the natives have done since Roman times. Take a dip inside the majestically appointed art nouveau <strong>Gell&eacute;rt Baths</strong> (Kelenhegyi &uacute;t 4, open daily 6am-8pm) – complete with majolica tiles and Roman columns; partake in a game of chess in the water at the enormous, palace-like <strong>Sz&eacute;chenyi Baths</strong> (&Aacute;llatkerti k&ouml;r&uacute;t 9-11, open daily, times vary); or go further back in time with a soak in the atmospheric, 16th-century <strong>Kir&aacute;ly Baths</strong> (Fő utca 84, open daily 9am-9pm) arguably the Turks’ finest contribution to the city. A more unorthodox way to enjoy this quintessential Budapest experience is to pop along to one of the increasingly popular night-time bath parties, if you’re into laser discos, that is. <br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Details at </em><em><a href=\"http://www.spasbudapest.com/\">spasbudapest.com</a></em></p> \n<p><strong>Buda Hills</strong><br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c72703ec28c92ca253f26ce624478833a48e65df\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636291433/a6997bb1-8f20-41a6-81bb-a1fef720dd0f-460x307.jpeg\" alt=\"Passengers queueing to get on the Children's Railway.\" width=\"460\" height=\"307\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Passengers queueing to get on the Children’s Railway.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Attila Volgyi/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>One way to escape the often sweltering mid-summer heat is to do as the locals do and take to the hills.

It’s a lovely slice of communist-era nostalgia, and heritage trains sometimes run. <br /><strong><br /></strong></p> \n<p><strong>Memento Park </strong><br />For the full-on communist-era experience, the <strong>Memento Park</strong> (also known as Statue Park) has an assemblage of oversized statues and memorials that once stood in prominent public spaces throughout the city, but which were shunted out here following the collapse of the Iron Curtain. Visitors can wander among various apparatchiks, see giant statues of Stalin and Lenin and watch a secret agent training video. They can then hop inside a Trabant 601 car, that most iconic of Eastern Bloc symbols. <br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> O<em>pen daily 10am until dusk, corner of Balatoni &uacute;t and Szabadkai utca, +36 1 424 7500, </em><a href=\"http://www.mementopark.hu/\"><em>mementopark.hu</em></a></p> \n<p><strong>Southeast Asian Gold Museum </strong><br />Budapest is full of terrific museums, but this little-known gem close to V&aacute;rosliget park is dazzling.

There is also a collection of naughty-looking linga, phallic-like symbols hewn from stone or rock crystal – they’re guaranteed to raise a smile.

Local drinkers in particular lap up its elegant ales, alongside beers from the nearby breweries Nant, Great Orme and, over in Snowdonia, Purple Moose. Indeed, such is the thirst for good beer around here that in a novel collaboration, these four breweries jointly manage Conwy’s Albion Ale House and have opened two new pubs, Conwy’s Bridge Inn and Porthmadog’s Australia. Collectively, they are pioneering a mini-boom in north Wales beer.</p> \n<p>Conwy Brewery’s design-your-own-beer day (&pound;350 for up to eight) and brewer experience days (&pound;95pp, 01492 514 305, <a href=\"http://www.conbrew.moonfruit.com/home/4583038338\">conwybrewery.co.uk</a>) allow visitors to get involved in that production process. Budding brewers are expected to help dig out spent brewing malt from the mash tun. “It’s physical work,” warns Gwynne.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c5aac641303110feb3e2bc41a385225c8ed6bf9e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639246490/8ec00bc2-9432-4cc5-b548-35ff1a2ff576-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Design-your-own-beer day at Conwy Brewery\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Design-your-own-beer day at Conwy Brewery</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Design-your-own-beer days are less arduous, handy as I am squeezing it all into a morning. After an introduction to mashing (where the malt is steeped in hot water) and the resulting wort (beer’s sugary base liquid), I find myself, at 11am, drinking a Clogwyn Gold, while Gwynne explains how hops determine a beer’s flavour. I like the upfront flavours of modern craft beers and so I go for a fruity, zesty combination of US-style Galaxy, Summit and Cascade hops. Gwynne is more of a traditionalist, but he will happily help guests brew any style: Belgian triple, saison, smoked porter. He promises to dry-hop mine, late on, to boost its flavour.</p> \n<p>Recipe calculated, hops weighed and the wort now boiling away, we chuck the initial load in. “The first mash stage is akin to coffee because you’re drawing from the grain,” says Gwynne. “This hop bit is akin to tea.”</p> \n<p>Normally, after further additions of hops as the boil progresses, the brewery lays on lunch for guests. Then, in the afternoon, they help cool the beer and strain it into the fermenter, using muslin to separate the trub (hop debris). Brewing being science as much as it is art, guest brewers also have to check the health of the yeast under a microscope, before pitching it into the wort to convert all that sugar into alcohol, carbon dioxide and delicious flavour compounds.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"82c1c909fb3499c87e59eb2f30d078fa73a723da\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434639356293/474daf09-12c3-4394-bd64-e7b8d6d01e34-460x308.jpeg\" alt=\"Castle Hotel restaurant\" width=\"460\" height=\"308\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Castle Hotel restaurant</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2015/jan/27/great-country-walks-moel-wnion-aber-falls-gwynedd-wales\">Great country walks: take the North Wales Path to Aber Falls, Gwynedd</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But Gwynne and I have a prior lunch date and so – entrusting my brew to the loving care of the lads in the brewery – we head into Conwy. The Castle Hotel is best-known for chef Andrew Nelson’s modern British cooking, though the slick bedrooms (from &pound;135) are top-notch, too.</p> \n<p>Over impressive plates of pork belly, braised shin beef and pints of Dawson’s Dark (which Conwy brews for the hotel, pint from &pound;3.30), Gwynne explains how he has ended up running pubs with three other breweries: basically, it is a simple way to sell beer. They are rivals but, at microbrewery level, rivalry is usually very friendly, and they had already collaborated successfully on the beer tent element of the October Conwy Feast food festival. “Brewers tend to be enthusiastic about the whole industry, so they talk to one another a lot. Maybe it’s just that love of beer and pubs. It’s a naturally social industry.”</p> \n<p>Lunch done, we walk up the high street to the Albion, rather than down to the more family-orientated Bridge Inn on Rose Hill Street near Conwy’s famous castle. But first, we stop in wine and craft beer shop <a href=\"http://vinomondo.co.uk/\">Vinomondo</a> at no 19: the owners have just launched <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BankofConwy\">Bank of Conwy</a>, a tapas bar and restaurant on Lancaster Square showcasing cutting-edge craft beers. It has 20 draught taps (from &pound;3.50 a pint).</p> \n<p>In contrast, the <a href=\"http://albionalehouse.weebly.com/\">Albion</a> (from &pound;3.10 a pint), on Uppergate Street is a stripped-back 1920s corner pub for purists. There is no TV, no jukebox. “We let conversation reign,” says Great Orme Brewery’s owner, Jonathan Hughes. Naturally, the bar features beers from all four owners, but, in a further example of beery solidarity, also guest ales from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BigHandBrewing\">Big Hand</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cwrwial.com/\">Cwrw I&acirc;l </a>and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Heavy-Industry-Brewing/165142926970911\">Heavy Industry</a>. “Bringing in other local brewers,” says Jonathan, “only makes the Albion stronger.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33be003fd8c2711e9ec1e8f2c921220a556fee51\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434642676612/7f9b326d-10da-4aca-b518-19b2799a9451-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hop-cured salmon, crispy pickled shallot rings and lemon cream cheese at The Kitchen Project\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hop-cured salmon, crispy pickled shallot rings and lemon cream cheese at The Kitchen Project</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/travel/2014/sep/25/top-10-hotels-b-and-bs-inns-in-wales-for-walkers\">Top 10 hotels, B&amp;Bs and hostels in Wales for walkers</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Heavy Industry, known for its award-winning Pigeon-Toed Orange Peel Hefeweizen, is the radical on the scene. “I don’t care about tradition – I’m interested in big, flavourful beers,” says owner Tom McNeil.

Stuart will be in a new location by the time you read this – The Kitchen is a series of pop-up events – but seek him out.

Paso Robles, 20 miles up state route 46, is in the heart of California’s Central Coast wine region. Paso, as locals know it, is in San Luis Obispo county, where the Salinas river runs out of the Santa Lucia mountains. The city of Paso Robles has a quaint downtown surrounded by 20 square miles of coastal mountain terrain.</p> \n<p>Although wine-making in the region dates back two centuries to when missionaries first began growing grapes, it’s only recently that the Paso Robles American Viticultural Area (AVA, a federally recognised wine classification) has become a region to watch. In the past decade the numbers of producers and acres under vine have doubled, and now the Paso Robles AVA is the fastest-growing wine region in the US, with over 200 boutique and family-owned wineries producing zinfandel, cabernet sauvignon and other varietals from Spain, Italy, Bordeaux and the Rhone.</p> \n<p>The terrain offers plenty for the eye: flat river valley floodplains give way to sweeping slopes dotted with homesteads, farms and wineries, with most vineyards sitting on rolling hillsides between 500 and 1,000 feet above sea level. One of Paso’s charms is its as-yet-undiscovered feel: on-property tasting rooms are cosy and nowhere near as packed as those in Napa valley, and are more often than not manned by the vintners themselves. And Paso’s charming historic downtown has great new places to eat and drink without the crowds – or the higher price point – of its more famous northern counterpart.</p> \n<h2><strong>WINEMAKERS TO VISIT</strong></h2> \n<h2>Bianchi</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eb876386e96e609b636a7eb530d4e1a70da1418\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434472899787/0d04312d-c83f-4762-9af2-d872c401f2dd-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Bianchi Wine, Paso Robles, California\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\"> </span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In September 2014, Bianchi’s zinfandel beat stiff competition to be crowned California Zinfandel Champion.

Known for estate-grown and hand-crafted wines, the Bianchi family’s wine producing heritage dates from 1974, when Joseph Bianchi and his son Glenn set up shop on the banks of the San Joaquin river, eight miles from downtown Paso. Winemaker Tom Lane attributes the brand’s recent success to the 2011 zinfandel’s subtle layers, something he strives to achieve in every vintage through experimentation with fruit from different vineyards, changing harvest times, new yeast strains, and fermentation and aging regimes in spicy barrel types. A glass-walled tasting room overlooks flat fields of vines that begin to sweep upwards to the rear of the property and, inside, a fireplace and warm earth tones create a welcoming setting for winter tastings.

Lacking equipment, Randy and Cheryl Phillips crushed their first barrel of grapes with their own feet in 2004; that first stomping of petite sirah and zinfandel grapes later became the couple’s first vintage, called Kick-Off. Every wine in their portfolio is estate-grown over 200 acres of vineyards – half are east of Paso Robles and the other half are at the Templeton Gap winery – but only a small proportion of the grapes they grow become Red Soles wine; the rest are sold to large wineries. Randy and Cheryl also run the Hacienda-style, terracotta-coloured tasting room. Stop by to sample the nutty, chocolatey 2012 Estate Syrah ($40), produced in the C&ocirc;te R&ocirc;tie-style with 10% viognier crushed and fermented with syrah, or bring a picnic and grab a bottle to enjoy on the vine- and oak -ringed lawn.<br /><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>3230 Oakdale Road, Paso Robles, + 1 805 226 9898, </em><a href=\"http://www.redsoleswinery.com/\"><em>redsoleswinery.com</em></a><em>.
