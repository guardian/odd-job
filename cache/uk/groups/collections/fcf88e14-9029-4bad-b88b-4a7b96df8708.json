The first sighting of a topless builder? Or that glorious <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2010/may/18/pimms\">first glass of alcoholic fruit salad known as Pimm’s</a>, the best of the season for the memories it brings rushing back of summers past and pitchers drained?</p> \n<p>Created in the early 19th century by one James Pimm as a digestif to serve in his London oyster bars, the brand (now owned by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/business/2015/jun/08/diageo-shares-takeover-rumours-guinness-jorge-paulo-lemann\">multinational Diageo</a>) has fairly cornered the market in summertime refreshment: 230,000 glasses of the stuff will be put away this Wimbledon fortnight. But, though I’m not one of those dreary sorts who affect to dislike its sweet-yet-slightly-bitter citrussy flavour, by this point in the summer, I have begun to wonder whether I could improve upon it at home (and save some money in the process). Many have tried to crack the recipe, but have any of them aced it?</p> \n<h2>The booze</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"458db1500d6841265d7437cd11568dfc9a1bff98\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435750885205/e44e01b5-c5dd-4876-9a4c-0a39a97bbfe7-460x443.jpeg\" alt=\"Marcia Simmons's summer cup.\" width=\"460\" height=\"443\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcia Simmons’s summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>The exact formulation for Pimm’s is a closely guarded secret and, in the manner of such valuable secrets, the marketing department trumpets the fact that the six people in the know are not allowed to travel together (a piece of information that gives me hope; six makes it a considerably less-secret recipe than say, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2009/may/26/irn-bru-recipe-scotland\">Irn Bru, whose devilish ingredients are known only to two people</a>). All they will say is that it’s gin-based and flavoured with a secret blend of herbs and spices. So far, so KFC.</p> \n<p>Tasting it unencumbered by mixers for possibly the first time in my life, I find it surprisingly rich and sweet – rather like the kind of wine served at holy communion in dusty parish churches in the deepest shires – with an orangey bitterness that lingers on the tongue. In fact, it has much more in common with other digestifs (such as Fernet Branca or, dare I say it, J&auml;germeister) than I would have guessed.</p> \n<p>The copycat recipes I try take this in several different directions. American drinks writer <a href=\"http://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2012/03/diy-pimms-homemade-pimms-no-1-recipe.html\">Marcia Simmons infuses gin and sweet vermouth with bitter orange peel and fresh orange</a> for 24 hours for a concoction that’s overwhelmingly citrussy – drinkable, certainly, but not quite Pimm’s. Imbibe magazine, <a href=\"http://imbibemagazine.com/homemade-pimm-s-recipe/\">which clearly read my tasting notes</a>, mixes its gin with sweet sherry or port (the latter, I think, would be a mistake) and adds sweet vermouth (which supplies that characteristic bitter edge) and orangey triple sec – but in these quantities I find it too sweet.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"035c6db7971e5db0d3b31c3455f666e1ef2f3279\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435750943397/9c4cd65b-ed9f-4c0b-8bb7-7b50ba417382-460x411.jpeg\" alt=\"Imbibe magazine's summer cup.\" width=\"460\" height=\"411\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Imbibe magazine’s summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://fromthelarder.co.uk/2014/07/homemade-pimms/\">Georgina Hartley, author of the From the Larder blog</a>, uses a mixture of gin, sweet vermouth, triple sec and aperol, which proves richer and sweeter than the original – nice diluted with tonic or soda, but too much with lemonade. Victoria Moore keeps things simple in her cheat’s Pimm’s, using equal parts gin, red vermouth and Cointreau (a triple sec), which proves amazingly effective as a quick substitute – in fact, some of my testers prefer it to the original, its slightly drier flavour giving it “more depth”. This one’s well worth a go for keen cocktail fiends who happen to keep these things in stock (red vermouth is an essential ingredient in that fine drink the negroni, so it’s a handy chap to have around in any case), but it’s a bit more aggressively bitter and citrussy than the real thing.</p> \n<p>On side-by-side tasting, however, I’m disappointed how thin and caramel-sweet Pimm’s is, so rather than attempting to recreate it exactly, I’m going to bump up the gin content, and add a soup&ccedil;on of triple sec for its citrus flavour, a slug of red vermouth and Aperol for bitterness, and just a dash of angostura bitters to give it some extra edge. Feel free to play about with the balance to suit your own tastebuds.</p> \n<h2>The mixer</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"42f7969f7ac21b42f9b1a6d9ab77bb251ddec2c3\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435751039066/6b48ef46-7918-425a-8d26-b1c757706524-460x436.jpeg\" alt=\"Georgina Hartley's summer cup.\" width=\"460\" height=\"436\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georgina Hartley’s summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Strangely, homemade lemonade, as used by both cocktail legend Dale DeGroff and Imbibe, just doesn’t work here – and neither, as Moore observes, does the “fancy cloudy stuff”. Both are just too assertively lemony, whereas clear lemonade (not Sprite, as Simmons recommends) lends the drink a gentler, sweeter flavour. Too sweet for some – Moore actually prefers her summer cup with tonic as she finds lemonade “too cloying”, while the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Larousse-Cocktails-Fernando-Castellon/dp/0600612619\">Larousse cocktail guide</a> proves the French know nothing about the subject by using soda water, which makes its version taste as underwhelming as a well-iced Pimm’s that’s been abandoned in the garden during a freak summer rainstorm.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6b61cf93b2532f417f8859ce7f04c0a7b6f0c334\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435751200528/d14670ce-26fa-4a11-8779-c7f3971b3c10-279x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Victoria Moore's summer cup.\" width=\"279\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Victoria Moore’s summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Americans seem to be keen on Pimm’s with ginger ale, a combination I have never encountered this side of the pond (and, believe me, I’ve got some serious experience in this field). The fieriness doesn’t really work for me; this should be a cooling drink that slips down the throat with dangerous ease, which is why I love Hartley’s delicately flavoured cucumber, verbena and mint-infused syrup, though I do find it too sweet when topped up with lemonade. Sparkling water, however, is perfect. Salvatore Calabrese suggests topping the drink up with champagne. Like the “turbo Pimm’s” served by my college bar, supercharged with extra gin or vodka, this is only a good idea if you’re not planning to sit around in the sun all afternoon glugging glass after glass of the stuff.</p> \n<h2>The garnish</h2> \n<p>“Don’t make a fruit salad,” Moore pleads, and I’m inclined to agree: a glass half-full of soggy fruit is no one’s idea of a good time. Though you’re perfectly welcome to use lemon or apple if you must (though the latter has an unattractive tendency to discolour), I think all you need is a curl of cucumber, which looks more handsome than the diced stuff, and a few strawberries – because, though yes, they do go a bit mushy after a bit, the only thing more redolent of a British summer than Pimm’s is a warm, sharp, sweet strawberry.</p> \n<p>Herb wise, I’d steer clear of Simmons’s sage or thyme, and stick with the wonderful cucumber flavour and vivid blue flowers of borage if you can find it (I had trouble this year), or cooling mint – but keep the leaves whole so they don’t dissolve into compost at the bottom of the glass. Add the garnish to the glasses as you serve, rather than putting them in the jug, to avoid strawberry envy. If you’re planning to stand around outside in the sun, then an ice-filled glass is a must, though make sure the ingredients are well-chilled before use. Just as you will be after drinking a couple of these.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd46bcfbd2b6dbc9682e88dd9c88ff1fb7b14891\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435751095695/d8b52f79-1698-41fe-aaa5-2f9c9c34a03c-460x415.jpeg\" alt=\"Dale DeGroff’s summer cup.\" width=\"460\" height=\"415\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dale DeGroff’s summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The perfect summer cup</h2> \n<p><em>For the mixer (makes enough for 4)</em><br />200g white sugar<br />&frac12; cucumber, sliced (not peeled)<br />2 generous sprigs of mint<br />1 unwaxed lemon<br />600ml cold sparkling water OR 225ml clear lemonade</p> \n<p><em>For the base (per drink)</em><br />35ml gin<br />25ml red vermouth<br />1 tsp triple sec<br />1 tsp Aperol<br />&frac12; tsp dry amontillado sherry <br />Angostura bitters <br />OR 75ml Pimm’s or other summer cup</p> \n<p><em>For the garnish (per drink)</em><br />2 strawberries<br />1 curl of cucumber peel<br />Sprig of borage or mint<br />Ice</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c699b5e3d9b51ba12087a97683bc55ef27601cdf\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435751685858/1994c68b-273a-4b05-b705-f007cae2126a-357x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect summer cup.\" width=\"357\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect summer cup.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If making the mixer, bring the sugar to the boil with 200ml water, stirring until dissolved.

The first is little more than crushed cherry tomatoes and basil spiked with red-wine vinegar. The other is more intense, smoky and sweet-sharp from roasting the tomatoes first with olive oil, rosemary and garlic, then crushing them and their blackened skins to a coarse, textured pur&eacute;e.</p> \n<p>It is the latter I made this week for two lunches, laid out on the rusty garden table, where I passed around bowls of mussels and fried pancetta, tarragon oil and toasted bread with lemon and pepper for everyone to stir into their soup as they wished.</p> \n<p>The second batch, two days later, came with caramelised onions, hot chilli toasts and spoonfuls of cool, white goat’s curd. We finished both lunches with white peaches, sliced and left to marinate in glasses of lightly citrus Kahlenberg Riesling.

Peel and chop the onions, then transfer them to a roasting tin. Discard the stalks and stems from the tomatoes, then cut them in half (or use whole cherry tomatoes). Pull the needles from the rosemary and mix them with the onions and tomatoes. Pour over the oil, tossing everything together. Place the whole head of garlic, unpeeled, among the tomatoes.</p> \n<p>Bake the tomatoes and onions for an hour, with the occasional stir, until the onions are soft, sticky and lightly coloured and the tomatoes have darkened. Remove from the oven and transfer the tomatoes, onions and the roasting juices to a blender or food processor.</p> \n<p>Break the garlic into cloves then squeeze the soft, inner flesh of each clove into a small dish. Add half the garlic to the tomatoes and reserve the other. Process the onions and tomato mixture until you have a coarse pur&eacute;e.

Keep the heat low to moderate stirring regularly, so that the onion softens then starts to caramelise. Scatter the sugar over the softened onion, let the sugar melt then, just as it starts to turn brown, stir in the balsamic vinegar.</p> \n<p>For the chilli toasts:<br /><strong>butter</strong> 50g<br /><strong>red chilli </strong>1, medium sized<br /><strong>ciabatta</strong> 4 slices<br /><strong>sea salt flakes</strong><br /></p> \n<p>Melt the butter in a small pan. Halve, seed and finely chop the chilli, then stir it into the butter. Using the oven at 200C/gas mark 6 or an overhead grill, toast the ciabatta on one side then place them on a baking sheet, uncooked side up and spoon over the chilli butter. Toast until the butter starts to sizzle and the bread colours, then sprinkle with sea salt flakes and serve with the soup.</p> \n<p>For the goat’s curd and basil oil:<br /><strong>goat’s curd</strong> 4 heaped tbsp<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 150ml<br /><strong>basil</strong> 20g<br /><strong>roasted garlic</strong> 5 cloves<br /></p> \n<p>Pour the olive oil into a blender or food processor, add the basil leaves and the garlic cloves and a pinch of salt, then process to a brilliant green oil.

If the question draws a blank, it’s a dead giveaway as to a person’s age, while the question itself often reveals much about someone’s interests and passions.</p> \n<p>For example, “Where were you when you had your first tomato moment?” “My <em>what</em> moment?” would be most people’s reply to that, but some obsessives will have a shortlist of their top five tomato moments, all waiting to be shared. They’re also likely to have a shot of some mixed chopped tomatoes as their phone screensaver (or is that just me?), or to entice us to open an Instagram image by giving it the tagline “Hello, sexy” – only to reveal a single heirloom tomato in <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/3v3bOWsSWy/\">its full, naked, perfect glory</a>.</p> \n<p>I’ve had many such moments of my own: sublimely sweet cherry tomatoes, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/04/dakos-onepot-chicken-recipes-ottolenghi\">chopped and piled high on dakos biscuits</a>, the Cretan barley rusk for which I fell so heavily a year or two back; a spectacular tomato and pomegranate salad at <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/istanbul/restaurants/fast-food/hamdi-restaurant\">Hamdi</a>, a kebab restaurant near Istanbul’s spice bazaar. My most memorable moment, however, came while hiking in the Italian coastal region of Liguria a few years ago. In the village of Manarola, we came across a patch of tomato vines heavy with intensely ripe, wonkily shaped, unevenly red and perfectly warmed fruit: the temptation to reach out was just too great, and the taste was unimprovable.</p> \n<p>These holiday experiences can be hard to replicate at home. Meals are savoured, phones get forgotten for large chunks of the day, actual conversation takes place, books get read. The holiday over, depsite all our good intentions to build these life-affirming habits back into our day-to-day lives, it’s all too easy to revert back to the habitual phone-checking, the box set and the meals eaten on the run.</p> \n<p>And so it is with tomatoes: the difference between those we’d happily feast on for breakfast, lunch and dinner while abroad, and what often passes for a tomato back home can be enormous. But if you shop wisely (and these days there’s a much bigger range on offer, in both local greengrocers and larger supermarkets), you can come pretty close to those holiday memories. Fill that basket with as many different varieties, sizes and colours as you can: orange Sungold cherry tomatoes, large ridged Brandywines, green, striped, you name it. When you get them home, keep that holiday sun in mind and don’t put them in the fridge: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2002/jul/06/foodanddrink.shopping1\">this dulls their fragrance and flavour</a>. And if you can, put your tomatoes out in the sun for a few hours before turning them into a salad: it makes a remarkable difference to the taste.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato, rhubarb and elderflower salad</strong></h2> \n<p>This salad is all about the quality and range of the tomatoes involved, so make an effort to get hold of as many different kinds, colours and sizes as you can, making sure they are all good and ripe. Elderflower is still just in season, so if you have any nearby, do go out and pick some: it makes the finished dish look even more stunning. I’ve kept this dairy-free, but it also works very well with some soft goat’s cheese dotted on top. With thanks to Esme Robinson. Serves six to eight.</p> \n<p><strong>2 tbsp elderflower cordial</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>4 tsp cider vinegar</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp Dijon mustard</strong><br /><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>160g rhubarb (1-2 sticks; pink, ideally)</strong><br /><strong>1.4kg mixed tomatoes, large ones cut into 0.5cm rounds, medium ones into 0.5cm-wide wedges, cherries halved</strong><br /><strong>5g fresh oregano leaves</strong><br /><strong>1 handful fresh elderflowers (optional)</strong></p> \n<p>Put the first five ingredients in a bowl with a half-teaspoon of salt and whisk. Cut the rhubarb on an angle into 2mm-thick slices, add to the bowl and leave to marinate for 30 minutes. Arrange the tomatoes on a platter and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Spoon over the rhubarb and dressing, scatter the oregano on top, and finish with elderflowers, if using.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato salad with horseradish cream</strong></h2> \n<p>This has quite a lot of horseradish, which I find works really well with the cream and the acidity of the tomatoes. If you don’t like the intensity, just use less. Serves six as a side dish or first course.</p> \n<p><strong>30g finely grated fresh horseradish (or 40g shop-bought horseradish sauce)</strong><br /><strong>1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tsp white-wine vinegar</strong><br /><strong>Coarse sea salt </strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>100ml double cream</strong><br /><strong>10g tarragon leaves, torn</strong><br /><strong>15g basil leaves, roughly shredded</strong><br /><strong>900g red tomatoes (a mixture of types and sizes, ideally), cut into 5mm-thick slices</strong></p> \n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk the horseradish with the garlic, vinegar, half a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of the oil and two tablespoons of cold water. Pour in the cream, whisking all the while, until you have a uniform, runny sauce (don’t over-whip: you don’t want the sauce to thicken), then stir through the tarragon and two-thirds of the basil.</p> \n<p>To serve, spread the horseradish cream on the bottom of six shallow bowls and top with the tomatoes, making sure to leave some of the cream visible underneath. Drizzle over the remaining oil, and add a sprinkle of basil and a pinch of salt.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chopped salad with tahini and za’atar</strong></h2> \n<p>The addition of tahini paste to a familiar tomato and cucumber salad is a revelation. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>6 ripe plum tomatoes, cut into 1cm dice</strong><br /><strong>2 mini-cucumbers, trimmed and cut into 1cm dice</strong><br /><strong>1 red pepper, seeds, stalk and pith removed, cut into 1cm dice</strong><br /><strong>5 spring onions, trimmed and thinly sliced on an angle</strong><br /><strong>15g coriander leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp lemon juice</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>200g feta, cut into 4 rectangular blocks (optional)</strong><br /><strong>4 tbsp tahini</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp za’atar</strong></p> \n<p>Put the chopped tomatoes in a sieve over a bowl for 20 minutes. Discard the resulting juice and put the tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper, spring onions and coriander in a large bowl. Add the lemon juice, oil and half a teaspoon of salt, and stir gently to combine.</p> \n<p>To serve, arrange the feta (if using) on four plates and spoon the salad on top, making sure some of the feta remains visible. Pour a spoonful of tahini over each portion and finish with a sprinkle of za’atar.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato and mozzarella salad with buckwheat and curry leaves</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1deaa196-30b2-4fbd-a937-e59753801cd0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140471804/2d63c69c-f3e2-41ea-824f-6cdb83482c17-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's tomato and mozzarella salad with buckwheat and curry leaves\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s tomato and mozzarella salad with buckwheat and curry leaves: a novel twist on the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil template.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian. Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Buckwheat is one of my favourite ingredients: I love its earthy, slightly nutty and smoky notes, and the welcome crunch it lends to any dish. Just leave it out if it’s not to your taste: the dish works well without it. I have to thank my friend <a href=\"http://www.peter-gordon.net/\">Peter Gordon</a> for the unusual flavour combination here. Serves six, as a first course.</p> \n<p><strong>1 large banana shallot, peeled and cut into thin, 2mm-thick rounds </strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp Pedro Xim&eacute;nez (or other sweet sherry) vinegar</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>600g tomatoes (as wide a range as you can get – the more colours, shapes and sizes, the better)</strong><br /><strong>40 fresh curry leaves (ie, from about 3 stems) </strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tsp black mustard seeds</strong><br /><strong>25g kasha (aka roasted buckwheat; optional)</strong><br /><strong>450g buffalo mozzarella, torn into six </strong></p> \n<p>Put the shallots in a large bowl with the vinegar, a tablespoon of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and set aside to steep for at least 30 minutes. Cut the larger tomatoes into 1cm wedges and smaller ones into halves or quarters – you’re aiming for tomato pieces of a roughly uniform size.</p> \n<p>Put a small saucepan on a medium heat and add the remaining oil. Once hot, tip in the curry leaves and mustard seeds, and fry for just a minute. Stir quickly, remove the pan from the heat and set aside to infuse and cool. Once cooled, pour the spiced oil over the onions, then mix into the tomatoes with another quarter-teaspoon of salt and half the kasha, if using.</p> \n<p>To serve, put a piece of mozzarella on each plate, spoon the tomato mixture on top and finish with the remaining kasha.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140311122/Yotam-Ottolenghis-tomato--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yotam Ottolenghi's tomato, rhubarb and elderflower salad: It's all about the quality of the tomatoes.

Just another day at the office, then. My crime that day was to have said during an episode of <em>MasterChef</em> that a dessert “looked like the sort of thing served at a cheap wedding full of regret held at a hotel on a ring road”. My correspondent’s stepdaughter had apparently just got married at a ring road hotel and it had been lovely. “I’m sure it was,” I replied, “but was it also full of regret? Because if it wasn’t, it isn’t covered by my critique.” I may be a snob, but I’m a precise snob.</p> \n<p>The touchiness shouldn’t have surprised me. When it comes to food at weddings people are like that. A wedding is one of life’s great set piece events, upon which the compass flickers. Accordingly everything about them must be perfect, even when everything plainly isn’t. And now it’s June, and wedding season is upon us. For the next few months many of us will be putting on suits and frocks smelling of dry cleaning fluid, and tramping into baggy marquees where we will eat some of the worst, most overpriced food ever inflicted upon us by people who claim to be our dearest friends. And then, regardless of how dismal it all was, we will loudly proclaim the opposite. In the coming months more lies will be told about the quality of lunch and dinner than in the rest of the year put together.</p> \n<p>We are meant to be experiencing a British food revolution, and in many ways we are. There are better restaurants than ever before. But in the business of mass catering we are generally awful. I say generally. Obviously, if you run a catering firm and you’re limbering up to complain, I don’t mean you. You’re brilliant. Likewise, the food at your wedding was obviously fabulous. It’s everyone else.</p> \n<p>Everyone else is responsible for dry canap&eacute;s that taste only of margarine and complacency. Everyone else is responsible for desiccated lumps of yesterday’s pre-cooked chicken the colour of an old stained sink; for sauces that could creosote fences and vegetables so overboiled you could suck them through a straw; for cream desserts that have split, and overbaked tarts with pastry like walnut shells. And the cost! I only use exclamation marks for shouting, which is what I’m doing. THE COST! Despite economies of scale, caterers charge more for this dismal crud than the price of a quality restaurant meal and rising. Why are they allowed to get away with it?</p> \n<p>Precisely because it’s a special event, and nobody likes to admit one of those isn’t actually that special. Plus, avoiding the pitfalls of mass catering dreariness requires a certain radicalism: the willingness to do away with the awful formally plated main course, to sack the poor exploited teenage waitresses and instead concentrate spend on the cooking. The problem is that weddings generally involve young people and for all their youthful irreverence, young people can be rather “small c” conservative. A wedding is a grown-up event, and they have a mythologised notion of what grown-up looks like, which includes a marquee and chicken the colour of a stained sink.</p> \n<p>Recently the savings expert Martin Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/cheaper-weddings\">website </a>said that, when booking a wedding reception at a hotel, tell them it’s for a party rather than for nuptials. Apparently hotels charge more the moment they hear it’s a wedding. This is good advice.

Gather around in as tight a huddle as our bulging stomachs will allow, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How to Eat</a> is going where others are too complacent to tread. Yes, we are opening a Tupperware pandora’s box and taking a large bite out of the humble cheese sandwich. Identified <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11537804/Britains-favourite-lunch-The-humble-cheese-sandwich.html\">last month</a> as the nation’s favourite weekday lunchtime repast, this is not just a snack but one of the building blocks of the British identity. One that, thankfully, has recently been exonerated after accusations it had played a principal role <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gavrilo-princips-sandwich-79480741/?no-ist\">in starting the first world war</a>. As ever, below the line, please choose your words caerphilly. Do not turn the air blue. If necessary, brie the feta man.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cheese </strong></h2> \n<p>Call me a militant, but I feel it is essential. No matter how vigorously vegans dispute that point. But what cheese should you use and should it be sliced or grated? These are questions which go to the very heart of what you want, not just out of this sandwich, but life. Do you want frivolous novelty? Do you crave impractical continental ingredients which, somehow, make you feel more sophisticated? Or do you want proven, steadfast flavour combinations?</p> \n<p>Fundamentally, there are very few cheeses that truly work in a sandwich. If you wish to avoid creating a dry, claggy sanger of a muddled, indeterminate character, you need to use something hard, waxy and tangy in the lincolnshire poacher or mature cheddar line, which you may want to augment with a little red leicester or double gloucester. Wonderful as they may be elsewhere, a sandwich is no place for the crumbly and/or dense likes of feta; wensleydale; almost all Lancashire cheeses; goat’s cheese (that is a salad cheese, no matter how you moisten it with beetroot); brie (especially when paired, egregiously, with cranberries); any of the blue cheeses; cream cheese*; cheshire; stinking bishop or any other gooey cheeses which must be sealed in a lead Hazmat container in your fridge, to stop your neighbours complaining about the smell.</p> \n<p>Of course, manchego, Parmesan and halloumi are not sandwich cheeses. Nor, unless you want to spend half the sandwich spraining your tongue, trying to dislodge a wad of bread and cheese that has welded itself to the roof of your mouth, are processed cheese slices and (my beloved) Dairylea. Any added fruit or added herb cheeses are, naturally, disqualified because they are an offence against god. </p> \n<p>If you are wondering about mozzarella’s absence, it only plays a serious part in hot sandwiches, often partnered with pesto. In a cold sandwich, it is a curiously rubbery, often slightly granular interloper, which delivers scant milky flavour.</p> \n<p>* Unless that cream cheese is on a bagel with smoked salmon of course, but, then, that is more a smoked salmon sandwich than a cheese one. </p> \n<h2><strong>Slice or grate?</strong> </h2> \n<p>If creating a “<a href=\"https://www.greggs.co.uk/menu/sandwiches/cheddar-cheese-savoury-/\">cheese savoury</a>” filling with celery, carrot, onion etc, then grating the cheese is necessary to ensure that all the ingredients are thoroughly intermingled. If you bind that mix with something (mayonnaise), and diligently press the mix into the bread with a fork as you fill the sandwich, any spillages should be minimised. However, a grated cheese sandwich without that binding agent is a nightmare. As you will have observed at weddings and funerals, after returning from the buffet table, every time you pick up your sandwich, a bit of grated cheese falls out on to your plate, shirt, the table or floor. You end up picking most of the cheese up with your fingers in between bites of your, by now, almost empty sandwich. After a while, it really grates.</p> \n<p>Slicing is eminently preferable. It ensures complete crust-to-crust coverage and eradicates spillage. However, be aware that anything above a thickness of 5mm is overkill. Constructing a cheese sandwich is a delicate balancing act. You must ensure flavour but also that the drier constituents of the sandwich (bread, cheese), do not dominate in a way that makes that sandwich a chore. </p> \n<h2><strong>Bread </strong></h2> \n<p>Whether you prefer to call it or “doorstep” or “doorstop”, my message is this: please cut your slices thinner. A great hulking sandwich appeals to us in an intuitive way. It is aesthetically pleasing. It evokes a prelapsarian past of bucolic rural plenty, a merrie England which probably only ever existed in the minds of the fiendish admen who created it. However, that fat sandwich is also a major pain in the posterior to eat. Unless you are using a bread so fresh it is still warm from the baker’s oven (which in cafes and pubs or at home, 98.9% of us are not), that is a massive wad of carbs and solidified fat to chew on. It takes some serious masticating. I do not want to swig tea or beer with each mouthful (thus, washing away the flavours of the sandwich), in order to get it down. Moreover, the primary flavour of a cheese sandwich should be cheese not bread – that is the star of the show, let it shine. Restrain yourself to slices of no more than 1cm in thickness.</p> \n<p>A good-quality soft, white, impeccably fresh loaf is the ideal, although ordinary supermarket white sliced is entirely serviceable (Warburton’s toastie is How To Eat’s recommended brand). Indeed, that is one of the joys of the cheese sandwich. It is one of those food items, like ice-cream or bacon, which can never be truly bad. From the cheapest block cheese to the finest small-batch, extra-matured cheddar, from the woolliest white sliced to the priciest artisan sourdough (its lactic piquancy always welcome), all cheese sandwiches tickle the pleasure centres at some level. So long, that is, as you haven’t made it on worthy wholegrain or the kind of seeded loaf that is like chewing through the leg of a wicker chair. Brown and darker rye breads have their place, but certainly not on a cheese sandwich where a lack of moisture is a constant threat. </p> \n<h2><strong>A short note on soft baps … </strong></h2> \n<p>Ordinarily, not the go-to sandwich bread. But if out for a picnic or travelling, there is something uniquely brilliant about a cheese and tomato bap that has been wrapped in Clingfilm for hours, and allowed to come to room temperature, so that the cheese begins to sweat out its oils and the juice from the tomatoes has had plenty of time to soak into the bread. Add a little salt, and even the blandest British tomatoes and the dullest processed cheddar will amalgamate into a flavour bomb that is so wet at its centre you can almost slurp it down.</p> \n<p>That point about temperature is a key for all cheese sandwiches, of course. Get all the components out of the fridge and let them warm up before constructing your sandwich. As Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/11/sandwich-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall\">rightly observed</a> in reference to chilled supermarket butties: “Who wants bread, butter and cheese at 3C?”</p> \n<h2><strong>Desirable extras</strong> </h2> \n<p>Raw onion (preferably red or mild Spanish, to limit halitosis); spring onion; caramelised onion; Branston Pickle (I am a late convert, but yes); pickled gherkins; good homemade coleslaw with cabbage; baby gem or iceberg lettuce for sweet, refreshing crunch. Please note: you generally only need one of those extras <em>plus</em> iceberg lettuce. That is, in order to retain the structural integrity of your sandwich and to ensure that all the ingredients can fully express themselves.</p> \n<h2><strong>Borderline extras </strong></h2> \n<p>Celery (banal on its own, but acceptable in a cheese savoury mix; see also carrot); tomato (ripe and salted); apple chutney (not overly sweet); a handful of crushed ready salted or cheese-and-onion crisps, for texture (but only on a very liberally, mayo-moistened sandwich).</p> \n<h2><strong>Undesirable extras </strong></h2> \n<p>Ham, chicken or tuna (what you have there is a ham, chicken or tuna sandwich, in which the cheese has been relegated to a “seasoning” role; see also fish fingers); piccalilli; cucumber (beyond pointless); beetroot; egg; horseradish; Marmite; and also Worcestershire sauce, tabasco, cayenne pepper or any other pushy, sharp-elbowed sauce and seasoning which people occasionally and idiotically use to try to jazz-up “cheese savoury”.</p> \n<h2><strong>Spreads </strong></h2> \n<p>Butter. Real butter. Not margarine. Not a low-fat spread. Not that voodoo ersatz butter that is spreadable straight from the fridge. Life is short. Accept no substitutes. Oh … and, of course, every cheese sandwich needs a dollop of mayonnaise. For moisture, for slick mouthfeel, for a little vinegary tang.</p> \n<h2><strong>The cut </strong></h2> \n<p>Horizontally through the middle of the bread. Never diagonally. Eat the less enjoyable “square edged” bottom half first, as it has the larger, drier crust area, and then sit back and savour that relatively luxurious, rounded top-half.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink </strong><br /></h2> \n<p>A huge, Sports Direct-sized mug of brick-red tea, or a zippy, lightly bitter golden or pale ale. </p> \n<h2><strong>When </strong></h2> \n<p>Dinner or tea. Although, I find the cheese sandwich is a reasonably effective breakfast hangover remedy, for those light-to-moderate days of fuzziness, when you still have the wherewithal to actually make yourself a sandwich.</p> \n<p>So, the cheese sandwich – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819360472/3d155c8f-2915-478e-b543-aa42776458a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"The full-on rustic approach … not without its pitfalls.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-05T10:00:22Z","lastModified":"2015-05-05T10:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":772,"contributors":[{"name":"Tony Naylor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tonynaylor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Sandwiches","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/sandwiches","webTitle":"Sandwiches"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tony Naylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/tonynaylor"}}],"series":{"title":"How to eat","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48v53","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819360472/3d155c8f-2915-478e-b543-aa42776458a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The full-on rustic approach … not without its pitfalls.

It’s a shame, because its bright tang is the ideal foil to the kind of sickly sweetness and heaviness that baking’s so prone to.

Once it’s up to temperature, turn the heat right down, or even off, to prevent it from smoking.</p> \n<p>3 While the oil heats, prepare the dough. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the egg, buttermilk and vanilla together in a separate bowl before adding this mixture to the dry ingredients. Stir together to get a sticky, malleable dough.</p> \n<p>4 Dust a work surface with plenty of flour, then empty the dough on to it. Pat the dough out to a thickness of roughly 1cm (you can use a rolling pin if you want, but I find it easier just to use my hands here), flouring it as you go to minimise sticking. Cut out 8cm circles using a pastry cutter, then use a smaller 3-4cm cutter or appropriately sized lid to stamp out the small holes in the middle of each doughnut. It’s up to you whether you gather up these doughnut holes to make more doughnuts or just fry them as they are.</p> \n<p>5 Fry the doughnuts in batches of 3 or 4, cooking them for 1 &frac12; minutes on each side. Once cooked, pat dry on a piece of kitchen towel to soak up any excess oil, then, while they’re still warm, dip them in the glaze, coating one or both sides. Leave to cool and set on a wire rack, then repeat the frying and glazing with the remaining doughnuts. These are at their best when they’re freshly cooked, but you can revive them the next day (if they last that long) by warming them in the microwave or a low oven.</p> \n<h2><strong>Blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns</strong></h2> \n<p>Chelsea buns, sticky cinnamon swirls, dough wrapped in toasted pecans and chocolate chips … sweet buns are as good as baking gets, but they’re not ideal if you’ve got an impatient sweet tooth. Too often the thought of a lengthy knead and slow prove sends me careering towards the biscuit tin instead in my laziness. This is a recipe that sidesteps all that hassle, using a quick buttermilk dough instead of the usual bread sort, so you can have these ready, from storecupboard to table, in under an hour. They’re great for breakfasts because they’re not too sweet, but just as good as an afternoon snack.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 12</strong><br />300g plain flour <br />75g wholemeal flour<br />125g caster sugar<br />1&frac12; tsp baking powder<br />1 tsp bicarbonate of soda<br />1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />50g poppy seeds<br />Zest of 2 lemons<br />300ml buttermilk<br />400g blueberries<br />150g icing sugar<br />Lemon juice</p> \n<p><br />1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 20x30cm roasting dish or baking tin with baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Stir the flours, 100g of the caster sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in the poppy seeds and lemon zest. Pour in the buttermilk and work the ingredients together using a wooden spoon until a rough, slightly sticky dough forms. If the mixture feels very floury or crumbly, add a drop of milk.</p> \n<p>3 Dust the work surface with flour and roll the dough out to a rectangle roughly 50x30cm, flouring the rolling pin as you go. Scatter the blueberries all over the surface of the rectangle and pat them gently into the soft dough. Dust over the remaining 25g of caster sugar.</p> \n<p>4 Roll the rectangle up from long edge to long edge to give a roll roughly 50cm long, pinching the dough a little as you reach the end to help it stay securely rolled. Trim off the ends, then cut into 12 equal slices. Arrange these rolls in the prepared dish, spacing them equally and leaving a couple of centimetres between each to allow them room to rise.</p> \n<p>5 Bake for 25-30 minutes, until they’re fat, firm to the touch and mottled with juice from the blueberries. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze: stir the icing sugar together with enough lemon juice to give a thick, but pourable icing.</p> \n<p>6 Once the buns are cooked and still hot from the oven, brush them liberally with the lemon glaze and leave to cool a while in their tin. These are at their best when still slightly warm. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"What is the most underused ingredient in British baking?\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/untitled_form_19_copy_12_copy_21\" title=\"COOK July 4 Ruby Bakes\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435832402955/a81f43f5-3fdd-4674-8ecd-2bae300eefbf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"Blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns (left) and sticky doughnuts.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-04T05:00:07Z","lastModified":"2015-07-04T05:00:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":4,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/buttermilk-recipes-doughnuts-blueberry-soda-bread-buns","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aazj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/buttermilk-recipes-doughnuts-blueberry-soda-bread-buns","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/buttermilk-recipes-doughnuts-blueberry-soda-bread-buns"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435832402955/a81f43f5-3fdd-4674-8ecd-2bae300eefbf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Buttermilk provides a quick rise and moist texture to these blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns (left) and sticky doughnuts.
