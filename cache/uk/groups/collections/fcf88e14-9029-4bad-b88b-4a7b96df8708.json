Chucking a load of ingredients into the pan and hoping for the best doesn’t really wash here, however hard you scrub.</p> \n<p>Softer and crumblier than toffee, smoother and richer than its close relative, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jan/22/how-to-make-perfect-tablet-recipe\">tablet</a>, its dairy content means fudge is associated particularly with the south-west, though shops churning it out in a mind-boggling array of weird and only occasionally wonderful flavours are de rigueur in tourist honeypots throughout the British Isles.

If you want to keep things simple, like candy <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">pros Mrs Hope and Mr Greenwood</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">folk from Rodda’s clotted cream</a> and <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/caramel-mousse-recipe\">Michelin-star chef Tom Aikens</a>, this can be caster or ordinary white granulated, but given sugar plays such a large part, the demerara suggested by the <a href=\"https://www.carnation.co.uk/recipes/67/Ultimate-Fudge\">Carnation condensed milk tin</a> or the light muscovado used by <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/creamy-sea-salted-fudge-recipe/#ftsTEEwRpKOcplKw.97\">Ren Behan in Jamie magazine</a> will give a more interesting flavour. Personally, I prefer the slightly more subtle caramel notes of the first here.</p> \n<p>Aikens and Roddas both also add some sugar syrup – boring glucose in the former case, ambrosial golden in the latter – which makes their fudge wonderfully smooth as opposed to the slightly gritty, sandy texture of the Carnation and Hope and Greenwood recipes, which, though undoubtedly pleasing, is more reminiscent of Scottish tablet. Clearly feeling two types of sugar aren’t quite enough, Aikens finishes his fudge with an infinitesimal amount of icing sugar, for, no doubt, very sound Michelin-starred reasons which I am unable to fathom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15f50824423376fe7324855e6d5deb45f925ddde\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945143833/02911193-5340-4c62-9f42-70adb1e18073-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roddas's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roddas’s fudge goes all out with clotted cream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The dairy</h2> \n<p>The second, and most important, ingredient in fudge is fat. Dairy fat to be precise. Some recipes cleverly combine the two ingredients in one big hit of nauseatingly delicious condensed milk, which makes their fudge taste distinctly like white chocolate – not that there’s anything wrong with this, but it’s not the classic flavour I’m after.</p> \n<p>Hope and Greenwood plump for the nostalgic boiled flavour of evaporated milk instead, an ingredient that has so far failed to reinvent itself for a more decadent age. Despite a weird complaint that it tastes “meaty”, I happen to like it, but not as much as the clotted cream which plays an unsurprisingly large part in the Roddas recipe, or the double variety in Aikens’s fudge.</p> \n<p>In fact, the Roddas recipe proves pretty popular; soft, smooth and rich, it’s classic Cornish seaside stuff. My only complaint is that the flavour is a little too sweet and rich, which I admit may sound ridiculous, but in a side-by-side comparison, we preferred those recipes using butter as well. Let’s be honest, everything’s better with butter. But, as butter and clotted cream could prove a fatal combination, a downgrade to double seems just what the doctor ordered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb2e571089756166bf95884fb673baae2a7c905b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945257884/e7b22b5b-562c-436a-b61f-86987205051f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ren Behan's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ren Behan’s recipes uses vanilla extract.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The flavouring</h2> \n<p>Though to make this a fair test I omit Hope and Greenwood’s peanut butter (anything containing peanut butter is always going to win big for me), I do allow Roddas, Behan and Aikens their vanilla. Not strictly necessary for a satisfactory result, but a lovely combination of flavours nevertheless – and this is one place where I think vanilla extract works better than those fiddly little seeds. Salt is another must – as ever, it brings out the best in the sugar, keeping it just the right side of sickly. How much you add depends on how enthusiastically you have embraced salted caramel mania over the last few years; sceptics will be content with a pinch, salt fiends like myself should up the dosage considerably. In for a penny, in for a pound.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28087b3b2da0edb1419a066bbbc37cab6d8e9da5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945369181/d110d9e0-c45d-47e4-9883-ecdc4f5be5c9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Aikens fudge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Aikens uses a high temperature to produce a more brittle fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>All the recipes I try start in much the same way, dissolving the sugar and dairy together over heat, bringing the resulting mixture to the boil, and then letting it simmer until it reaches the desired setting temperature. (Covering the pan, as Roddas suggest, works fine, but feels a bit scary to me; I prefer to keep my molten sugar where I can see it.)</p> \n<p>The difference comes in temperature, which ranges from 113C from Behan, which gives a very soft, almost fondant-like result, to Aikens’s 121C, which is brittle and chewy, more like a hard caramel than a fudge. Even Hope and Greenwood and Carnation’s 118C is a bit harder than I had expect from a fudge – my testers and I agree that Roddas have hit the sweet spot at 116C: firm enough to hold its shape, soft enough to melt in the mouth.</p> \n<p>Lots of recipes give advice about how to achieve this without a sugar thermometer (dropping a little into a glass of cold water until it reaches a pliable consistency), but this is a fiddly and inexact science, so I’d recommend investing in a sugar thermometer. They’re not expensive, and they’ll work forever (though be careful when washing as they can be delicate).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff868836c9b6e7193c7f55d0a3b6ca6c64059f29\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945538506/71cf141a-be66-4573-94d9-0c1097f9e045-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hope &amp; Greenwood's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hope &amp; Greenwood’s fudge has a slightly gritty texture.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Stirring?</h2> \n<p>Fudge, like tablet, is beaten as it cools to help it thicken. Behan suggests allowing it to cool a little before doing this, but I can’t see that it makes much difference, apart from making it dangerously tempting to sample (still not a good idea, however tough you think your tongue is). Once it’s set completely, however, it’s every man for himself. I cannot be held responsible for the consequences. Add chopped nuts, dried fruit, crisp nuggets of streaky bacon … your call.</p> \n<h2>The perfect fudge</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1ffc0ad8082f6feb097654dd62cb6a614aaf625\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434004392334/11b8acb2-0705-4248-a43a-41958b7cd118-460x318.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"318\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>(makes 1 x 23x23cm tin)</em></p> \n<p>100g butter<br />550g demerara sugar<br />200g golden syrup<br />350ml double cream<br />1 tsp vanilla extract<br />&frac14;-&frac12; tsp sea salt flakes</p> \n<p>Melt the butter, sugar and syrup and cream in a medium, high-sided heavy-based pan, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.

It’s the time for new takes on seasonal classics to be enjoyed in the garden</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>It has come to that point in the year when I want food that is light, gently flavoured and peaceful. No loud notes or vivid colours on my plate, just mild, quietly seasoned food for a summer’s day. Tempting as it is to bring out the summer classics – bowls of chilled cucumber soup, or perhaps a crab salad, a plate of cold salmon with herb mayonnaise or a pork pie – I hate the idea of food standing still. There is too much fun to be had.</p> \n<p>I made a soup this week, a broth of green peas and lettuce. Even though we ate it hot, it tasted clearly of the season. Green and light, it seemed only right to eat it in the garden. I introduced a fresh, acidic note with a rather generous amount of lemon, adding brightness to the roasted chicken broth. To make it more substantial I made toasts of ciabatta with olive oil and grated parmesan to dunk in it as we ate.</p> \n<p>The same principle, of introducing something sharp or sour to what is essentially a mild dish, included making pickled vegetables to dress a ball of creamy burrata. Courgettes and thin-skinned kohlrabi brought a crunchiness to the soft, quivering cheese, the vegetables having been given a brief pickling in vinegar, lemon and horseradish. I could have used a firmer mozzarella or even feta, but burrata is the number one summer cheese for me.</p> \n<p>Other ways I like to freshen up well-known summer classics include roasting a salmon with lemon and tarragon (tuck the herbs inside the belly of the fish with a slice of butter, squeeze the lemon over the fish and add the empty shells to the tin). I also like to add chopped radishes and even a little ripe chilli to a cold cucumber soup and let their heat liven it up.</p> \n<p>At dessert level, it can be fun to update the old summer pudding recipe with a shot of sloe gin, or by adding a layer of lemon syllabub before the cream to a fruit trifle. In our house, even strawberries and cream get a new look with a splash of raspberry pur&eacute;e and peppery basil over the berries.</p> \n<h2>Lettuce soup with parmesan toasts</h2> \n<p>The flavour will stand or fall on the quality of the stock, so it is worth making your own. I use wings rather than a whole chicken and roast them before making the stock.<br /></p> \n<p>Serves 4<br />For the chicken stock:<br /><strong>chicken wings</strong> 8<br /><strong>water</strong> 1.5 litres<br /><strong>onion </strong>1 medium-sized<br /><strong>thyme</strong> 8 sprigs<br /><strong>bay leaves</strong> 2<br /><strong>black peppercorns</strong> 6</p> \n<p>For the soup:<br /><strong>chicken stock</strong> 1 litre (see above) <br /><strong>peas</strong> 300g, frozen is fine<br /><strong>lettuce</strong> 400g<br /><strong>mint </strong>8 leaves<br /><strong>lemon </strong>half</p> \n<p>For the toasts:<br /><strong>ciabatta</strong> 4 thick slices<br /><strong>olive oil</strong><br /><strong>parmesan</strong> 3 tbsp grated</p> \n<p>Make the roast chicken stock by putting the chicken wings into a roasting tin, pour over the oil then roast for 40 minutes or until golden brown and lightly crisp-skinned.</p> \n<p>Transfer the roasted wings to a deep pot, pour some of the water into the roasting tin and stir to dislodge any juices stuck to the tin. Pour into the pot with the rest of the water, add the onion, peeled and cut in half, the thyme, bay leaves and peppercorns. Bring to the boil. Lower the heat to a simmer. Using a draining spoon remove any froth that comes to the surface and discard. If you leave it there it will make your stock cloudy. Let it simmer for an hour then strain through a fine sieve.</p> \n<p>Bring the chicken stock to the boil. Add the peas and let them cook in the stock for four or five minutes, until tender. Lower the heat to a simmer then add the shredded lettuce. Tear up the mint leaves and stir them in, together with the juice of the half lemon and a seasoning of salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Toast the bread on one side, using an overhead grill, then turn over and trickle with olive oil. Dust the surface with grated parmesan and toast until the parmesan has started to melt and turn golden. Ladle the soup into four warm bowls then float the toasts on top and serve.</p> \n<h2>Burrata with pickled vegetables</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e17164d176678067bdb22b25843658a9c805e75\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433943859119/2db0bde8-8c28-4de5-b147-1d1fea528e97-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Say cheese: burrata with pickled vegetables.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Perfect as a light main course.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>red onions</strong> 2<br /><strong>lemon </strong>juice of 1<br /><strong>kohlrabi</strong> 500g<br /><strong>fresh horseradish</strong> 20g, fresh<br /><strong>yellow courgette </strong>1<br /><strong>green courgette </strong>1<br /><strong>white-wine vinegar</strong><br /><strong>burrata </strong>2</p> \n<p>Peel the red onions and slice them thinly, to about the thickness of a 10p piece.

Courgettes are gorgeous as they are, and win my most exacting taste test every time</p>","byline":"Yotam Ottolenghi","body":"<p>I love food to look beautiful. With vegetables, in particular, it can be just the natural colour that gets me: the pink-through-white in a stick of rhubarb, say, or the spray of purple on an artichoke. The way a vegetable is cooked can work a similar magic: the black lines on a slice of chargrilled aubergine or butternut squash look stunning, as do black poppy seeds scattered through a cucumber salad, pink peppercorns mixed into a&iuml;oli, fried slices of red chilli and garlic on broccoli.</p> \n<p>But the most exacting trial I put any recipe through is whether or not it passes my Very Delicious test. Like most people for whom English is a second language, I have a few stock phrases that I’ve made my own – even if they’re not quite grammatically correct. “Absolutely lovely”, I gather, is fine, as is “very tasty”, but the word “delicious” allows no room for improvement (my research tells me it’s a non-gradable adjective); so I’m all-too aware that describing something as “very delicious” is a bit OTT. It’s my phrase, though, and one that makes perfect sense to me; I have no plans to drop it any time soon.</p> \n<p>Some of the most very-delicious dishes, however, are the least beautiful. I’m not sure what the correct grammatical term for that is, but I do know the dish that exemplifies this contradiction above all others: stuffed courgettes. Over the years, I’ve cooked, eaten and written about stuffed courgettes in many different guises, and they rarely make the grade under the glare of the camera. The long cooking time required, as the vegetables stuffed with rice, spices and herbs swell in their braising stock, turns that once-vibrant green skin dull and that once-firm flesh limp. The taste, on the other hand, is knockout level, and if anything it’s even better the day after, especially when served with some minty yoghurt.</p> \n<p>If you want your courgette dish to pass both the Very Delicious and the looks tests, there are all sorts of things you can do to make it more attractive. I’m too much of a pasta-head to embrace <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jan/09/how-to-swap-carbs-for-vegetables-spaghetti-meatballs-recipe-residency-hemsley\">the spiralising trend</a>, which involves passing courgettes through a sharp blade and turning them into “courgetti”, but what do I know? The craze has taken off, with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/apr/29/spiraliser-courgettes-hero-vegetables-supermarket-sales-soar\">supermarkets reporting a huge rise in courgette sales</a>.</p> \n<p>For me, courgettes are gorgeous just as they are, in – for example – a simple salad of thinly shaved raw strips tossed in olive oil, and served with a sharp green leaf such as sorrel, parmesan shavings and toasted pistachios. Or roasted whole, the smoky flesh scooped out and used as a dramatic dip. I’m not sure there is anything that scores higher on the beauty front than courgette flowers, all yellow and billowy, stuffed with ricotta, dipped in a light batter and quickly fried, served as they are or on top of a vegetable pie. Beautiful and very, very delicious.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chargrilled courgette and sorrel salad</strong></h2> \n<p>Emphatic proof, if any were needed, of the beauty that chargrilling lends to courgettes. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>90ml olive oil</strong><br /><strong>40g capers, drained and patted dry with kitchen paper</strong><br /><strong>20g pine nuts</strong><br /><strong>5 medium courgettes (a mix of green and yellow, if you can find them), trimmed and sliced on the diagonal into 1cm slices</strong><br /><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong><br /><strong>20g parmesan, shaved</strong></p> \n<p>For the salsa<br /><strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp lemon juice</strong><br /><strong>Finely grated zest of &frac12; lemon</strong><br /><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>10g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>30g sorrel, shredded</strong></p> \n<p>Pour two-thirds of the oil into a small saucepan and put on a high heat. Once hot, add the capers and fry for about two minutes, until they have opened up. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the capers to a plate lined with kitchen paper. Add the pine nuts to the pan, fry for 15-20 seconds, until just turning golden-brown, and add to the capers. Discard the oil.</p> \n<p>Put a ridged griddle pan on a high heat (ventilate your kitchen). Put the courgette slices in a bowl with the remaining olive oil, a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper, and mix to coat. Grill in batches for about 90 seconds in total, turning once halfway through so both sides get dark char marks but the courgettes retain a bite. Transfer to a bowl and repeat with the rest.</p> \n<p>Put all the salsa ingredients in a small bowl, stir to combine, then toss into the courgettes. Spread on a platter, sprinkle over the capers, pine nuts and parmesan, and serve warm or at room temperature</p> \n<h2><strong>Steamed courgette with garlic and oregano</strong></h2> \n<p>Best made with young, tender courgettes, this dish works just fine with regular-sized ones, too. I love the final flourish of thinly sliced raw garlic, but if that’s a bit too much for your tastes, fry it with the oregano at the end. These make a simple and delicate starter, or as part of a meze. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>800g young courgettes, trimmed<br />Coarse sea salt</strong><br /><strong>250ml chicken stock</strong><br /><strong>4 garlic cloves, peeled and sliced paper-thin</strong><br /><strong>20 sprigs fresh oregano</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. If the courgettes are very small, keep them whole, otherwise cut them in half lengthways. Lay the courgettes cut side up in a high-sided ceramic baking dish (about 27cm x 22cm) in which they’ll sit quite snugly. Sprinkle over three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and set aside.</p> \n<p>Pour the stock into a small saucepan with half the garlic and half the oregano sprigs. Bring to a boil, then pour the hot stock all over the courgettes. Cover the dish tightly with a layer of aluminium foil and bake for 45 minutes, until the courgettes are very soft, then set aside to cool a little.</p> \n<p>Pick the leaves from the remaining oregano sprigs and discard the stems. In a small frying pan, heat the oil on a medium-high heat and, once good and hot and shimmering, fry the leaves for 90 or so seconds, until they start to crisp up, then tip into a small bowl.</p> \n<p>When you are ready to serve, lift the courgettes out of the warm stock and arrange them on a serving platter or on smaller individual plates. Scatter the crisp oregano leaves over the courgettes, pour over the oregano oil, too, then sprinkle on half a teaspoon of salt and the remaining slices of raw garlic, and serve at immediately.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a34590cb553d68fcabfa7d31e8bf14ad54b8d3f0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433953850794/4de037ca-af10-441f-9b45-c908615ae6f1-327x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Courgette and ciabatta frittata\" width=\"327\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s courgette and ciabatta frittata: light, fluffy and comforting – what more could you ask for?</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian.

It’s light, fluffy and comforting (not least because the bread is soaked in milk and cream before it goes into the mix). Serve this with a mixed herb and bitter leaf salad, dressed with lemon juice and olive oil, and perhaps a few chunks of feta. Don’t waste the ciabatta crusts: blitz them into breadcrumbs and freeze – they keep really well. Serves six.</p> \n<p><strong>500g ciabatta, crusts removed and roughly torn (about 250g net)</strong><br /><strong>200ml milk</strong><br /><strong>200ml double cream</strong><br /><strong>2 large garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>6 large eggs, lightly beaten</strong><br /><strong>&frac34; tsp cumin</strong><br /><strong>80g parmesan, finely grated</strong><br /><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>2 medium courgettes, washed and coarsely grated</strong><br /><strong>25g basil leaves, torn</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Mix the ciabatta, milk and cream in a bowl, cover and set aside for 30 minutes, to give the torn bread time to absorb most of the liquid.</p> \n<p>In a large bowl, mix the garlic, eggs, cumin, 50g parmesan, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a quarter-teaspoon of ground pepper. Tip in the contents of the bread bowl, then stir in the courgette and basil.</p> \n<p>Heat a 20cm x 25cm baking dish in the oven for five minutes. Remove, brush all over with oil, to grease, then pour in the courgette mixture. Level out the top, bake for 20 minutes, then sprinkle over the remaining parmesan. Bake for 20-25 minutes longer, until the frittata is golden-brown on top and cooked through (test by inserting a knife into the centre – it should come out clean). Set aside to rest for five minutes, then serve.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433953425231/Chargrilled-courgette-and-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":372,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chargrilled courgette and sorrel salad: best made with a mixture of green and yellow courgettes, to up the stakes in the looks department.

The winner: a<a href=\"http://www.steenbergs.co.uk/blog/2015/04/40-years-on-the-shelf-the-winner-of-our-oldestspice-competition-was-pickling-spice-from-1975/\"> pot of Sainsbury’s pickling spices bought in 1975 for 19p</a>. Clearly we should celebrate such Olympic standard procrastination. I’m sure they were planning to get round to their brilliant home-pickling project, just as soon as they had rearranged the cutlery drawer. But for me that response was overlaid by something else: recognition.</p> \n<p>For, purely by coincidence, while Steenbergs was encouraging the nation to excavate their kitchen cabinets, we were also giving our own walk-in larder a clean out. I say “we”. It was entirely my wife’s doing. I was minded to let sleeping condiments lie. Two of my unbending rules for a happy life: never look under a teenager’s bed and never, ever mess with the kitchen cupboards.</p> \n<p>But she was determined. And so the great work began. I stood by and watched as the kitchen surfaces were quickly covered with a Manhattan of bottles and jars of ancient vintage. This brought me face to face with all my unrealised ambitions as a domestic cook. My desire to be an endlessly inventive kitchen warrior with a seemingly boundless repertoire, piled up unceremoniously before me.</p> \n<p>There were the jars of buttercup-yellow preserved lemons, and the dinky pots of harissa paste, the colour of coagulating blood, from the period when I was determined to explore the wilder shores of the Levantine culinary tradition. There were things called “marmalade” which didn’t involve oranges, and pitch-black pastes made from damsons which I seem to recall needing for my home experiments in neo-rustic British nose-to-tail eating. And don’t get me started on the Asian stuff: the fermented bean pastes with endless permutations of chilli and dried shrimp; the misos of ever darkening shades; the rice wines and soys and vinegars.</p> \n<p>Some of these had been opened. I peered inside to find a few with a deep dimple where I had sampled this new genius purchase, and then realised I didn’t have a clue what to do with it. Others had developed furry moulds so thick I didn’t know whether to scoop them out or stroke them and get them baptised. And then there were those – oh the shame – where the seal hadn’t even broken.</p> \n<p>I should beat myself up here over the disgusting waste, and I do. It doesn’t matter how long it takes to throw something away: waste is still waste. But even more than that I mourn all those dishes that could have been. They were not undermined by lack of ingredients. I reckon I had even accumulated the makings for a couple of Yotam Ottolenghi’s simpler recipes. They were undermined by lack of commitment.</p> \n<p>I’m sure when I bought the myriad jars I meant it. I really was going to become a different kind of cook. I really was going to stop making the same old things. But I was going to become that different cook tomorrow. Or perhaps the day after that. Or next week.

Sounds simple, right?<br /></p>","byline":"Tony Naylor","body":"<p>Gourmets! Gastronauts! The unfeasibly greedy! Gather around in as tight a huddle as our bulging stomachs will allow, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How to Eat</a> is going where others are too complacent to tread. Yes, we are opening a Tupperware pandora’s box and taking a large bite out of the humble cheese sandwich. Identified <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11537804/Britains-favourite-lunch-The-humble-cheese-sandwich.html\">last month</a> as the nation’s favourite weekday lunchtime repast, this is not just a snack but one of the building blocks of the British identity. One that, thankfully, has recently been exonerated after accusations it had played a principal role <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gavrilo-princips-sandwich-79480741/?no-ist\">in starting the first world war</a>. As ever, below the line, please choose your words caerphilly. Do not turn the air blue. If necessary, brie the feta man.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cheese </strong></h2> \n<p>Call me a militant, but I feel it is essential. No matter how vigorously vegans dispute that point. But what cheese should you use and should it be sliced or grated? These are questions which go to the very heart of what you want, not just out of this sandwich, but life. Do you want frivolous novelty? Do you crave impractical continental ingredients which, somehow, make you feel more sophisticated? Or do you want proven, steadfast flavour combinations?</p> \n<p>Fundamentally, there are very few cheeses that truly work in a sandwich. If you wish to avoid creating a dry, claggy sanger of a muddled, indeterminate character, you need to use something hard, waxy and tangy in the lincolnshire poacher or mature cheddar line, which you may want to augment with a little red leicester or double gloucester. Wonderful as they may be elsewhere, a sandwich is no place for the crumbly and/or dense likes of feta; wensleydale; almost all Lancashire cheeses; goat’s cheese (that is a salad cheese, no matter how you moisten it with beetroot); brie (especially when paired, egregiously, with cranberries); any of the blue cheeses; cream cheese*; cheshire; stinking bishop or any other gooey cheeses which must be sealed in a lead Hazmat container in your fridge, to stop your neighbours complaining about the smell.</p> \n<p>Of course, manchego, Parmesan and halloumi are not sandwich cheeses. Nor, unless you want to spend half the sandwich spraining your tongue, trying to dislodge a wad of bread and cheese that has welded itself to the roof of your mouth, are processed cheese slices and (my beloved) Dairylea. Any added fruit or added herb cheeses are, naturally, disqualified because they are an offence against god. </p> \n<p>If you are wondering about mozzarella’s absence, it only plays a serious part in hot sandwiches, often partnered with pesto. In a cold sandwich, it is a curiously rubbery, often slightly granular interloper, which delivers scant milky flavour.</p> \n<p>* Unless that cream cheese is on a bagel with smoked salmon of course, but, then, that is more a smoked salmon sandwich than a cheese one. </p> \n<h2><strong>Slice or grate?</strong> </h2> \n<p>If creating a “<a href=\"https://www.greggs.co.uk/menu/sandwiches/cheddar-cheese-savoury-/\">cheese savoury</a>” filling with celery, carrot, onion etc, then grating the cheese is necessary to ensure that all the ingredients are thoroughly intermingled. If you bind that mix with something (mayonnaise), and diligently press the mix into the bread with a fork as you fill the sandwich, any spillages should be minimised. However, a grated cheese sandwich without that binding agent is a nightmare. As you will have observed at weddings and funerals, after returning from the buffet table, every time you pick up your sandwich, a bit of grated cheese falls out on to your plate, shirt, the table or floor. You end up picking most of the cheese up with your fingers in between bites of your, by now, almost empty sandwich. After a while, it really grates.</p> \n<p>Slicing is eminently preferable. It ensures complete crust-to-crust coverage and eradicates spillage. However, be aware that anything above a thickness of 5mm is overkill. Constructing a cheese sandwich is a delicate balancing act. You must ensure flavour but also that the drier constituents of the sandwich (bread, cheese), do not dominate in a way that makes that sandwich a chore. </p> \n<h2><strong>Bread </strong></h2> \n<p>Whether you prefer to call it or “doorstep” or “doorstop”, my message is this: please cut your slices thinner. A great hulking sandwich appeals to us in an intuitive way. It is aesthetically pleasing. It evokes a prelapsarian past of bucolic rural plenty, a merrie England which probably only ever existed in the minds of the fiendish admen who created it. However, that fat sandwich is also a major pain in the posterior to eat. Unless you are using a bread so fresh it is still warm from the baker’s oven (which in cafes and pubs or at home, 98.9% of us are not), that is a massive wad of carbs and solidified fat to chew on. It takes some serious masticating. I do not want to swig tea or beer with each mouthful (thus, washing away the flavours of the sandwich), in order to get it down. Moreover, the primary flavour of a cheese sandwich should be cheese not bread – that is the star of the show, let it shine. Restrain yourself to slices of no more than 1cm in thickness.</p> \n<p>A good-quality soft, white, impeccably fresh loaf is the ideal, although ordinary supermarket white sliced is entirely serviceable (Warburton’s toastie is How To Eat’s recommended brand). Indeed, that is one of the joys of the cheese sandwich. It is one of those food items, like ice-cream or bacon, which can never be truly bad. From the cheapest block cheese to the finest small-batch, extra-matured cheddar, from the woolliest white sliced to the priciest artisan sourdough (its lactic piquancy always welcome), all cheese sandwiches tickle the pleasure centres at some level. So long, that is, as you haven’t made it on worthy wholegrain or the kind of seeded loaf that is like chewing through the leg of a wicker chair. Brown and darker rye breads have their place, but certainly not on a cheese sandwich where a lack of moisture is a constant threat. </p> \n<h2><strong>A short note on soft baps … </strong></h2> \n<p>Ordinarily, not the go-to sandwich bread. But if out for a picnic or travelling, there is something uniquely brilliant about a cheese and tomato bap that has been wrapped in Clingfilm for hours, and allowed to come to room temperature, so that the cheese begins to sweat out its oils and the juice from the tomatoes has had plenty of time to soak into the bread. Add a little salt, and even the blandest British tomatoes and the dullest processed cheddar will amalgamate into a flavour bomb that is so wet at its centre you can almost slurp it down.</p> \n<p>That point about temperature is a key for all cheese sandwiches, of course. Get all the components out of the fridge and let them warm up before constructing your sandwich. As Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/11/sandwich-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall\">rightly observed</a> in reference to chilled supermarket butties: “Who wants bread, butter and cheese at 3C?”</p> \n<h2><strong>Desirable extras</strong> </h2> \n<p>Raw onion (preferably red or mild Spanish, to limit halitosis); spring onion; caramelised onion; Branston Pickle (I am a late convert, but yes); pickled gherkins; good homemade coleslaw with cabbage; baby gem or iceberg lettuce for sweet, refreshing crunch. Please note: you generally only need one of those extras <em>plus</em> iceberg lettuce. That is, in order to retain the structural integrity of your sandwich and to ensure that all the ingredients can fully express themselves.</p> \n<h2><strong>Borderline extras </strong></h2> \n<p>Celery (banal on its own, but acceptable in a cheese savoury mix; see also carrot); tomato (ripe and salted); apple chutney (not overly sweet); a handful of crushed ready salted or cheese-and-onion crisps, for texture (but only on a very liberally, mayo-moistened sandwich).</p> \n<h2><strong>Undesirable extras </strong></h2> \n<p>Ham, chicken or tuna (what you have there is a ham, chicken or tuna sandwich, in which the cheese has been relegated to a “seasoning” role; see also fish fingers); piccalilli; cucumber (beyond pointless); beetroot; egg; horseradish; Marmite; and also Worcestershire sauce, tabasco, cayenne pepper or any other pushy, sharp-elbowed sauce and seasoning which people occasionally and idiotically use to try to jazz-up “cheese savoury”.</p> \n<h2><strong>Spreads </strong></h2> \n<p>Butter. Real butter. Not margarine. Not a low-fat spread. Not that voodoo ersatz butter that is spreadable straight from the fridge. Life is short. Accept no substitutes. Oh … and, of course, every cheese sandwich needs a dollop of mayonnaise. For moisture, for slick mouthfeel, for a little vinegary tang.</p> \n<h2><strong>The cut </strong></h2> \n<p>Horizontally through the middle of the bread. Never diagonally. Eat the less enjoyable “square edged” bottom half first, as it has the larger, drier crust area, and then sit back and savour that relatively luxurious, rounded top-half.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink </strong><br /></h2> \n<p>A huge, Sports Direct-sized mug of brick-red tea, or a zippy, lightly bitter golden or pale ale. </p> \n<h2><strong>When </strong></h2> \n<p>Dinner or tea. Although, I find the cheese sandwich is a reasonably effective breakfast hangover remedy, for those light-to-moderate days of fuzziness, when you still have the wherewithal to actually make yourself a sandwich.</p> \n<p>So, the cheese sandwich – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819360472/3d155c8f-2915-478e-b543-aa42776458a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"The full-on rustic approach … not without its pitfalls.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-05T10:00:22Z","lastModified":"2015-05-05T10:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":772,"contributors":[{"name":"Tony Naylor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tonynaylor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Sandwiches","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/sandwiches","webTitle":"Sandwiches"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tony Naylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/tonynaylor"}}],"series":{"title":"How to eat","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48v53","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819360472/3d155c8f-2915-478e-b543-aa42776458a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The full-on rustic approach … not without its pitfalls.

Sat somewhere between the richness of a cake and the body of a loaf of bread, scones are perfectly light, fluffy and tender – the ideal vessel for everything from butter to fruit to jam and clotted cream.</p> \n<p>The method is easy: just mix flour and a little butter, a raising agent and some liquid to give a heavy, slightly sticky dough. The rest is yours to experiment with: try wholemeal flour, add a drop of heavy cream, sweeten the dough with sugar, or golden syrup. Even a handful of honeycomb fragments or a few chocolate chips can be a welcome addition.</p> \n<p>While the purists squabble over pronunciation and whether you’re meant to put the cream on before the jam, take your scones far from the stagnant pedantry, go off-piste, and adapt them to suit your tastes.</p> \n<h2><strong>Spelt, blackberry and lemon cream shortcake</strong></h2> \n<p>Strawberry shortcake might be the archetype, but I find the slight tartness of blackberries a better match for the richness of cream, sugar and butter.

Pat down on the prepared baking tray to a fat disc 15-16cm in diameter. Put in the oven straight away (if you leave it sitting around too long, the bicarbonate of soda will exhaust itself, and the shortcake might not rise as well as it should) and bake for 20-25 minutes – or as long as it takes for the shortcake to rise, gently dome and set firm.</p> \n<p><strong>6 </strong>Leave the shortcake to cool a while before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. It’ll be really hot from the oven, so it’s important that you give it this time to rest before slicing and serving.</p> \n<p><strong>7 </strong>Whisk the remaining double cream, yoghurt, lemon zest and icing sugar together until thick enough to hold in soft peaks. Halve the shortcake horizontally to give two flat discs (they’ll be fragile, so take care to handle them gently). Spoon the cream all over the lower half, then spread over the blackberries and sprinkle on the mint. Sandwich with the other half of the shortcake and dust liberally with icing sugar. Serve straight away.</p> \n<h2><strong>Saffron, honey and sultana scones</strong></h2> \n<p>These aren’t the kind of scone meant to be served heaped with cream and jam. Infused with fragrant saffron and sweet with honey and fruit, they are perfect as they are – just split and spread thickly with salted butter.</p> \n<p><strong>Makes 12-15</strong><br />200ml milk<br />A couple of pinches of saffron threads<br />75g unsalted butter<br />350g plain flour<br />4 tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp bicarbonate of soda<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />175g sultanas<br />4 tbsp runny honey<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />1 egg, lightly beaten with 2 tsp milk, to use as a glaze<br />4-5 tbsp demerara sugar</p> \n<p><strong>1 </strong>Heat the milk and saffron gently until just shy of the boil, then leave to cool and infuse. By the time the milk’s at room temperature, it should be a rich yellow colour, and deeply fragrant. While the milk cools, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6 and lightly grease a large, heavy baking sheet.</p> \n<p><strong>2 </strong>Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips, mixing until no visible bits of butter are left. Stir in the baking powder, bicarbonate of soda and salt. Stir in the sultanas. In a separate bowl, whisk the honey and vanilla together with 160ml of the milk (some of the milk will have evaporated when it was heated, which is why we started with a little more than we needed).</p> \n<p><strong>3 </strong>Add the liquid slowly to the flour mixture, stirring gently as you go. The dough ought to be soft, very slightly sticky but robust enough to cut into neat rounds. A wetter dough will yield lighter scones, while a drier one will leave you with hockey pucks. Add a dash more milk, if necessary. Resist the urge, too, to overmix the dough – the less you work it the better. Just stir until roughly combined then use your hands to finish mixing the ingredients, taking care to distribute the fruit evenly throughout. Tip the dough on to a lightly floured work surface and knead just a couple of times to bring the mixture smoothly together.</p> \n<p><strong>4 </strong>Dust the work surface with a little more flour and pat the dough down gently to a thickness of roughly 2cm. You can roll it if you prefer, but there’s no need to be too particular. Use a 6cm round pastry cutter to stamp out circles, and gently transfer these to the prepared baking tray.</p> \n<p><strong>5 </strong>Brush the tops of the scones with the egg to glaze them then sprinkle with demerara sugar. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, until well-risen, firm and golden brown. Leave to cool completely before serving.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"What is the correct order for topping your scone?\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/untitled_form_19_copy_12_copy_17\" title=\"COOK June 13 Ruby Bakes\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434019741038/2ffed876-fe27-4676-8e4f-0ad31042675a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"Spelt, blackberry and lemon-cream shortcake (a bit like a scone) and unusual saffron, honey and sultana scones.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-13T05:00:15Z","lastModified":"2015-06-13T05:48:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":18,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/scone-recipes-shortcake-ruby-tandoh","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ybd","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/scone-recipes-shortcake-ruby-tandoh","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/13/scone-recipes-shortcake-ruby-tandoh"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434019741038/2ffed876-fe27-4676-8e4f-0ad31042675a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"On the right: spelt, blackberry and lemon-cream shortcake (‘in essence just big scone’) and unusual saffron, honey and sultana scones.
