There’s even an international chain dedicated to them. So, are they worth adopting?</p> \n<h2>The preparation</h2> \n<p>If you buy your chicken wings whole, you’ll need to separate them into the rather winsome sounding drumettes and flats. Drying them before cooking, preferably for a few hours in the fridge, as <a href=\"http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/the-chicken-book-the-definitive-cookbook-every-chicken-recipe-youll-ever-need/9780091959722\">Catherine Phipps suggests in her book Chicken</a>, or, if you don’t have the time, at least drying them with paper towels just before cooking, will help the skin to crisp up (and a chicken wing, given the scanty meat involved, stands or falls on its skin). I don’t think the wings require seasoning with salt and garlic powder, as Phipps recommends, though; although this gives them a good flavour when eaten au naturel, it clashes with the spicy, intensely savoury sauce they are tossed in later, which may be why she admits to a weakness for the odd handful “as is”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c96019d2be265cd45012dee276677b6c8cfbb78e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436351593692/f877aa18-8ee2-4987-ad52-51494c228925-460x381.jpeg\" alt=\"Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"381\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The coating</h2> \n<p>Early recipes don’t include any coating – the chicken is just fried as is. The Joy of Cooking, however, coats the wings with seasoned flour, while <a href=\"http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1858-buffalo-wings\">Cook’s Illustrated goes for cornflour</a> for “an even crispier exterior”. They’re delicious, but turn flabby and disappointing far more quickly than the plain variety, especially when doused in hot buttery sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9abf4f1c08123836d631888fd03cf68568dca763\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352238844/f59dfc50-8373-4def-867d-6216d7c206c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Joy of Cooking's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Joy of Cooking’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The cooking</h2> \n<p>True bar buffalo wings are deep-fried, but many home recipes shy away from this – as Phipps perspicaciously observes: “The coating makes the wings literally drip in butter anyway, I prefer to bake them.” Alton Brown, <a href=\"http://altonbrown.com/buffalo-wings/\">the scientifically minded American television chef</a>, avoids deep-frying on the basis that “most American cooks lack access to commercial fryers” – though, presumably, they do have saucepans and stoves, which is all you need to deep-fry something. He steams them first, “to render out a lot of the fat”, then cools them to “tighten the skin” before baking. I’m impressed at how crisp both baked versions are, but the meat inside is undeniably dryer than the deep-fried wings from Saveur, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated. If you’re really against frying, however, Phipps’s recipe is considerably less faff than Brown’s, and works just as well – bake at 220C for 20-25 minutes on each side.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"350e244f2af06922443b5aad7220937a38de25b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352329320/5147c0f8-59d7-4048-94e2-cba2e2869d9c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alton Brown's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alton Brown’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The sauce</h2> \n<p>The original recipe is as simple as you’d expect for something allegedly knocked up on the spur of the moment in a bar: hot sauce and butter (or margarine if you’re to believe Saveur, though I can’t bring myself to give it a try because I really don’t want to eat deep-fried chicken smothered in tasteless fat). Brown adds garlic, which I really like, and Phipps, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated all stick some vinegar in there, too, which accentuates the natural edge of the sauce and balances the richness of the butter nicely.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41820286efa3aef3ce1d626b1ed2e0aedeaeebe9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352431066/f92fef42-2111-4a2f-9d45-8550cd403cdf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Saveur's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saveur’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most recipes call for a specific brand of hot sauce: <a href=\"https://www.franksredhot.com/\">Frank’s</a>, which is a sour, piquant condiment made from cayenne peppers in Missouri, but, though it is available in this country, I think you can use whichever one you happen to like. Indeed, Cook’s Illustrated found that most of its tasters found Frank’s rather mild, so they mix it with something “a little more dynamic” but, as long as it’s hot and sour, it will work. That said, I do like the pinch of dark brown sugar the magazine adds to “round out the flavours” – but, as these depend on which sauce you use, I’d recommend tasting and adjusting to suit your palate. And, though it’s sacrilege, I’d also suggest drizzling the dressing over the wings, rather than tossing them in it – they stay crisper that way.</p> \n<h2>The blue-cheese sauce</h2> \n<p>And what’s the natural accompaniment for spicy deep-fried chicken wings? Why, a rich, salty blue-cheese dip, of course – and it should be intensely savoury, which is why The Joy of Cooking’s roquefort works better than Phipps’s stilton or Cook’s Illustrated’s mild, creamy blue. Mayonnaise supplies body, and sour cream or creme fraiche the requisite tanginess; buttermilk is too runny here, pleasingly American as it sounds. A dash of vinegar accentuates the tang, along with just a splash of sweet and intensely savoury Worcestershire sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b0378c48309d07d7d2b47f74070fcb405d7518\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352561594/2eda6752-809a-4fd9-988b-8ee0eeb598eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cook's Illustrated's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cook’s Illustrated’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m not keen on raw onion or dried garlic powder (the other flavours are harsh enough), and parsley, though pretty, is distractingly fresh and peppery, unlike the more harmonious chive.</p> \n<p>Serve with carrot and celery sticks and pretend it’s healthy.</p> \n<p><strong><em>(serves 4 with sides)</em></strong><br /><em>For the wings</em><br />16 wing pieces (or 8 whole wings)<br />Neutral oil, to fry<br />40g butter<br />2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />120ml sour hot sauce, eg Frank’s <br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1 tsp dark brown sugar<br />2 carrots, peeled and cut into batons<br />2 celery sticks, destringed and cut into lengths</p> \n<p><em>For the blue-cheese sauce</em><br />100g crumbled roquefort<br />6 tbsp sour cream or creme fraiche<br />2 tbsp mayonnaise<br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce<br />Small bunch of chives, finely chopped (optional)</p> \n<p>If you have time, remove the wings from their packet and put them on a rack above a bowl or tray in the fridge for between 1 and 12 hours.

A jam, glowing jewel-like on the breakfast table, can be a fine thing if you have bothered to remove the stones; hell if you haven’t. But, other than that, cherries are best eaten from the bag or, better still, served cold, in a bowl of ice cubes that you have crushed to a near slush-puppy texture.</p> \n<p>An exception is a pickled cherry. A snap of sweet and sour to bring out the best in a slice of ham, a fillet of oily fish such as a tuna steak or a fillet of silver-skinned mackerel. When I say pickled, I don’t mean the fruit should be kept lurking in a jar of malt vinegar and spices for six months. I mean a quick 20-minute pickle, bright as a button, with star anise, black peppercorns, mild red wine and vinegar, and just enough sugar to stop your lips smarting.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week I simmered a ham in apple juice and served the amber broth with a dose of pickled cherries. The faintly salty cooking liquor and sour cherries were a perfect balance for the sweet, thick-cut meat and fat. An initial boiling in water prevented an over-salty broth. Skimming the surface regularly kept the juices clear and bright.</p> \n<p>The next day we ate the ham cold, cut thinner this time, with a spinach salad (dressing: cider vinegar, walnut oil, grain mustard, lemon juice) with more of the cherries and their juice. Afterwards, greedy for more of the pickled fruit, we ate thick yogurt sweetened with whipped cream, a pinch of sugar and the meanest seasoning of ground cinnamon. We then tipped a tiny spoonful of the cherries over the folds of creamy, spice-flecked yogurt.</p> \n<h2>Pickled cherries</h2> \n<p>I used dark, sweet dessert cherries for this. If you are using sour fruit, then add a little more sugar. Makes 500g of pickled cherries.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>cherries </strong>500g<strong> </strong><br /><strong>red-wine vinegar </strong>125ml<br /><strong>red wine</strong> 375ml<br /><strong>sugar </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>black peppercorns </strong>1 tsp<br /><strong>star anise </strong>2 whole<strong> </strong><br /></p> \n<p>Pull the cherries from their stalks, then halve each fruit and remove the stones. Put the stoned cherries into a stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan then pour in the vinegar and red wine and bring to the boil. Stir in the sugar, the peppercorns and the star anise then lower the heat so the liquid bubbles gently for 3 or 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the mixture to cool.</p> \n<h2>Grilled mackerel, pickled cherries and samphire</h2> \n<p>The sour pickling juice of the cherries does the work of lemon juice here, balancing the oily richness of the fish. A few spoonfuls over the hot fish are as important as the cherries themselves.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>mackerel fillets </strong>4<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>samphire </strong>2 handfuls<br /><strong>pickled cherries </strong>6 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>Check the mackerel fillets for any stray bones, then place them skin-side down on a lined grill pan. Brush them lightly with olive oil, then season with a little salt. Cook under an overhead grill or over the bars of a hot grill for four minutes on each side until lightly cooked through. (The advantage of cooking over a grill is that you will have crisp skin, too, but an overhead grill works well enough.)</p> \n<p>Rinse the samphire in cold running water and trim any tough roots. Put the samphire in a bowl and add the cherries and their juices. Toss the cherries and samphire and leave for a few minutes while the mackerel cooks. Place a bed of samphire and cherries on two plates, spoon over the cherry pickling liquor, then place a couple of fillets on each. Spoon over a little more pickling liquor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dcc71522b93afbfb41333d5575e4833d8d7d40b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661454346/430168d5-e760-48e1-bd70-2e071f686d58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Slater's gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe on a round plate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: Nigel Slater’s gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe.

Pour in the litre of water and the apple juice, then tuck in the bay leaves. Add the peppercorns and cloves and bring to the boil. If any froth comes to the surface, remove it with a draining spoon. When every bit of froth has been removed and the liquid is clear, lower the heat so it bubbles gently, then partially cover with a lid.</p> \n<p>Let the gammon cook for about 60-90 minutes, checking the liquid level from time to time and turning the meat carefully once or twice to ensure even cooking. Switch off the heat but leave the meat in the cooking liquor.</p> \n<p>Lift the meat out and place it on a carving board. Taste the cooking liquid, correct the seasoning if necessary. Carve the meat into thick slices and put two or three per person into shallow dishes or deep plates.

With its multiple long, thin stems sprouting from a swollen, globe-shaped base, it looks very weird indeed, like something from outer space.</p> \n<p>For something so odd-looking, however, its flavour is very mild-mannered and neutral. If you’ve never tried kohlrabi, do give it a go. It belongs to the cabbage family and, eaten raw, tastes a&nbsp;bit like a mild sweet radish or cauliflower stalk. Thinly shaved, or cut into batons or dice, and added to a slaw or stir-fry, kohlrabi is crunchy and refreshing, with a little peppery kick for added interest. I love to eat young kohlrabi raw at this time of the year, and slow-cook the larger bulbs in the colder months, especially in a creamy gratin.</p> \n<h2><strong>Kohlrabi and lime salad</strong></h2> \n<p>Possibly the most amount of flavour packed into one of the shortest recipes I’ve ever written. Serves four, generously.</p> \n<p><strong>3 small kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 5mm x 5cm batons (500g net weight)</strong><br /><strong>2 granny smith apples, peeled and cut into 5mm x 5cm batons</strong><br /><strong>2 green chillies, deseeded and julienned</strong><br /><strong>15g picked coriander leaves</strong><br /><strong>15g picked mint leaves</strong><br /><strong>10g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 spring onions, trimmed and thinly&nbsp;sliced</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp black sesame seeds</strong><br /><strong>Finely grated zest of 1 lime, plus 2&frac12;&nbsp;tbsp lime juice</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp groundnut oil</strong><br /><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>80g creme fraiche</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp sesame oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong></p> \n<p>Put all the ingredients apart from the&nbsp;creme fraiche and sesame oil in a&nbsp;big bowl with three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt. Stir well, then divide between four plates. Spoon creme fraiche on top, followed by a little drizzle of sesame oil, and serve at once. (See, simple.)&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Spicy aubergine with kohlrabi and coconut</strong></h2> \n<p>Serve this with warm naan bread or&nbsp;poppadoms, and maybe some plain&nbsp;rice. Serves four to six.</p> \n<p><strong>120ml sunflower oil</strong><br /><strong>1 medium kohlrabi, peeled and cut into 5cm-long and 1cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>2 large onions, peeled and cut into 2cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>3 aubergines, cut into 7cm-long and 3cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>&frac34; tsp turmeric</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp ground cumin</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp black mustard seeds</strong><br /><strong>4 whole sprigs fresh curry leaves (about 30 leaves)</strong><br /><strong>2 large tomatoes, cut into 2cm-thick wedges</strong><br /><strong>80g fresh coconut, finely grated (ie, the flesh from roughly half a small coconut)</strong><br /><strong>220g Greek yoghurt</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp lime juice</strong><br /><strong>20g coriander leaves, roughly chopped</strong></p> \n<p>For the spice paste<br /><strong>4 large stalks lemongrass, woody ends and outer layer removed and discarded, very finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>6cm piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>6 fresh kaffir lime leaves</strong><br /><strong>1 red chilli, roughly chopped </strong><br /><strong>1 dried red chilli, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 cloves garlic, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 small banana shallot, peeled and roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>90ml sunflower oil</strong></p> \n<p>Put all the spice paste ingredients apart from the oil in a food processor. With the motor running, slowly add half the oil and process until you have a paste, stopping the machine and scraping the sides of the bowl as you go. Set aside (the remaining three tablespoons of oil will be used to fry the paste later). &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Heat a tablespoon and a half of oil in a large-heavy based saucepan or saute pan for which you have a lid, and put on a medium-high heat. Add the kohlrabi and cook, stirring often, for about 10 minutes, until it starts to soften and turn a dark golden-brown. Tip into a large bowl.</p> \n<p>Pour another tablespoon and a half of oil into the pan, add the onion and saute for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft and golden-brown. Add to the kohlrabi bowl.</p> \n<p>Add the last of the oil to the pan and fry the aubergines for 15 minutes, stirring from time to time, until soft and golden-brown, but still holding their shape. Stir in the turmeric, cumin and a teaspoon and a half of salt, cook for two minutes, then add the mustard seeds, cook for a minute and add to the kohlrabi bowl.</p> \n<p>Wipe clean the pan and put on a medium-low heat. Add the reserved oil from the spice paste and, when hot, add the paste and fry gently for about 25 minutes, stirring often, until it takes on a nice golden colour. Add the curry leaves and tomatoes, cook for five minutes, then add the fried vegetables and 400ml cold water. Cover and cook on a low heat for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</p> \n<p>To serve, divide the curry into bowls and scatter with coconut. Put a spoonful of yoghurt on each portion (serve the rest on the side), add a squeeze of lime and a sprinkling of coriander, and serve at once.</p> \n<h2><strong>Kohlrabi kimchi</strong></h2> \n<p>Kimchi is an acquired taste, but those who enjoy it, myself included, tend to find it addictive, and eat it with just about anything: grilled meat, seafood, or just spooned over a bowl of rice. The longer you leave the kimchi, the more the flavours develop – it will keep in the fridge for several months. Makes about 900g.</p> \n<p><strong>3 large kohlrabi, peeled, cut in half horizontally and then into 5mm-thick&nbsp;slices</strong><br /><strong>12 spring onions, trimmed and cut into 4-5cm slices</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tbsp caster sugar</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>3cm piece ginger, peeled and finely&nbsp;chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp nanami togarashi (Japanese assorted chilli pepper)</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp fish sauce</strong></p> \n<p>Put the kohlrabi and spring onion in a large bowl with the sugar and two teaspoons of salt. Mix and set aside for 45 minutes, stirring once or twice. Drain off any moisture that has leached from the vegetables and add the garlic, ginger, nanami togarashi and fish sauce to the bowl. Mix to combine, cover with cling-film and put somewhere dark and cool for two days. Transfer to a clean airtight container and store in the fridge.</p> \n<h2><strong>Fritti misti</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6adac030eaa8ddaf0c516f2f772c5fc03bb52e1f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435759803973/6e956356-0974-4cd2-86bf-abf5018c4674-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's fritti misti\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s fritti misti: ‘My version of a dish at San Francisco’s legendary Zuni Cafe.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Louise Hagger for the Guardian. Food styling: Emily Kydd</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This is my version of a dish at San Francisco’s legendary <a href=\"http://www.zunicafe.com\" title=\"\">Zuni Cafe</a>. Use a mandolin, if you have one, to slice the vegetables as thin as they need to be. You can use any seasonal veg you fancy; most will work really well, just as they do&nbsp;for tempura. The batter’s good with seafood, too. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>120g plain flour</strong><br /><strong>120g semolina</strong><br /><strong>1&frac14; tbsp coriander seeds, roughly crushed</strong><br /><strong>1&frac14; tbsp whole aniseed, roughly crushed</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>400g buttermilk</strong><br /><strong>1 litre sunflower oil, for frying</strong><br /><strong>1 medium&nbsp;kohlrabi, peeled, trimmed and cut into 5mm-wide rounds</strong><br /><strong>1 medium desiree potato, peeled and cut&nbsp;lengthways&nbsp;into 3mm-wide rounds</strong><br /><strong>1 small fennel bulb, trimmed and cut lengthways into 5mm-wide slices </strong><br /><strong>1 lemon, cut into 2mm-thick slices, plus 4 lemon halves for squeezing</strong><br /><strong>20&nbsp;large&nbsp;sage leaves</strong><br /><strong>40g capers, rinsed and patted dry</strong></p> \n<p>Put the flour, semolina, coriander, aniseed and a teaspoon and a quarter of salt in a shallow bowl. Mix well and set aside. Pour the buttermilk into a separate shallow bowl.</p> \n<p>Pour the oil into a large saucepan and put on a medium-high heat for five to six minutes, until it reaches 160C (if you have one, use a probe or thermometer to check). While the oil is warming, dip the kohlrabi a slice at time into first the buttermilk and then the flour, just so it’s roughly covered. Once all the kohlrabi is battered, carefully drop the slices into the oil in batches of about&nbsp;eight&nbsp;and fry for&nbsp;two to three minutes, turning once halfway through, until golden-brown on both sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on a wire rack lined with kitchen paper; transfer to a medium oven to keep hot while you repeat with the remaining kohlrabi.</p> \n<p>Batter and cook the potato, fennel, lemon and sage in the same way: the potato and fennel will take two to three minutes, the lemon one to two minutes and the sage only about 30 seconds. Don’t worry if they are not evenly covered by the batter: the finished dish looks better if you can see some of the vegetable through the crisp coating.</p> \n<p>Once all the vegetables are fried, add the capers to the oil (ie, don’t dip them in the buttermilk and flour first) and fry on a medium heat for a&nbsp;minute, until they open up like flowers and go crisp. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and add to the vegetables. Transfer the fritti misti to a large platter or individual plates, and serve with the&nbsp;lemon halves to squeeze over.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\" title=\"\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\" title=\"\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/7/1/1435759590348/Yotam-Ottolenghis-kohlrab-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yotam Ottolenghi's kohlrabi and lime salad: 'Possibly the most amount of flavour packed into one of the shortest recipes I've written.'

Just another day at the office, then. My crime that day was to have said during an episode of <em>MasterChef</em> that a dessert “looked like the sort of thing served at a cheap wedding full of regret held at a hotel on a ring road”. My correspondent’s stepdaughter had apparently just got married at a ring road hotel and it had been lovely. “I’m sure it was,” I replied, “but was it also full of regret? Because if it wasn’t, it isn’t covered by my critique.” I may be a snob, but I’m a precise snob.</p> \n<p>The touchiness shouldn’t have surprised me. When it comes to food at weddings people are like that. A wedding is one of life’s great set piece events, upon which the compass flickers. Accordingly everything about them must be perfect, even when everything plainly isn’t. And now it’s June, and wedding season is upon us. For the next few months many of us will be putting on suits and frocks smelling of dry cleaning fluid, and tramping into baggy marquees where we will eat some of the worst, most overpriced food ever inflicted upon us by people who claim to be our dearest friends. And then, regardless of how dismal it all was, we will loudly proclaim the opposite. In the coming months more lies will be told about the quality of lunch and dinner than in the rest of the year put together.</p> \n<p>We are meant to be experiencing a British food revolution, and in many ways we are. There are better restaurants than ever before. But in the business of mass catering we are generally awful. I say generally. Obviously, if you run a catering firm and you’re limbering up to complain, I don’t mean you. You’re brilliant. Likewise, the food at your wedding was obviously fabulous. It’s everyone else.</p> \n<p>Everyone else is responsible for dry canap&eacute;s that taste only of margarine and complacency. Everyone else is responsible for desiccated lumps of yesterday’s pre-cooked chicken the colour of an old stained sink; for sauces that could creosote fences and vegetables so overboiled you could suck them through a straw; for cream desserts that have split, and overbaked tarts with pastry like walnut shells. And the cost! I only use exclamation marks for shouting, which is what I’m doing. THE COST! Despite economies of scale, caterers charge more for this dismal crud than the price of a quality restaurant meal and rising. Why are they allowed to get away with it?</p> \n<p>Precisely because it’s a special event, and nobody likes to admit one of those isn’t actually that special. Plus, avoiding the pitfalls of mass catering dreariness requires a certain radicalism: the willingness to do away with the awful formally plated main course, to sack the poor exploited teenage waitresses and instead concentrate spend on the cooking. The problem is that weddings generally involve young people and for all their youthful irreverence, young people can be rather “small c” conservative. A wedding is a grown-up event, and they have a mythologised notion of what grown-up looks like, which includes a marquee and chicken the colour of a stained sink.</p> \n<p>Recently the savings expert Martin Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/cheaper-weddings\">website </a>said that, when booking a wedding reception at a hotel, tell them it’s for a party rather than for nuptials. Apparently hotels charge more the moment they hear it’s a wedding. This is good advice.

The unbearably anally retentive! Please assemble in the e-meeting room that is theguardian.com. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How To Eat </a>– the blog series charged with identifying the ideal version of Britain’s favourite dishes – is back and, this month, we’re tackling that controversial classic, tuna salad. It is the star of a million at-desk lunches (so long as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2012/nov/15/liz-kendall-tuna-salad-row\">no one nicks yours from the fridge</a>, that is), and the perfect quick fall-back meal on a hot summer’s evening, but it comes in 1,001 varieties and all but one of them is completely and utterly wrong. So, without further ado, lettuce commence. As ever, keep it cool BTL: no flakiness, no raw language, no overly salty exchanges. </p> \n<h2><strong>The tuna </strong></h2> \n<p>Way back in the mists of time (1998), when we were all obsessed with the perceived sexiness and health-giving properties of the Mediterranean diet, there might have been an excuse for using seared, thinly sliced tuna steak in a salad. We were young, we were foolish and this novelty wasn’t (from memory) &pound;30-a-kilo. But, in 2015, to do so would be a flagrant waste of that precious rosy flesh. Its delicate flavour is best savoured as a rare treat, rather than leaving it to jostle for attention in a salad of competing flavours. </p> \n<p>Instead, tinned tuna will do the job - which is not to say that all tinned tuna is created equal. There is a self-evident hierarchy of quality, both for the tuna itself (flaked useless, chunks marginally better, steaks best), and the liquid it is preserved in. Tuna in spring water or brine is dry, mealy, abominable stuff. Sunflower oil is better, but for maximum flavour it has to be in olive oil. </p> \n<p>I trust it goes without saying that you should <em>never</em> a) use smoked tuna, b) mix tuna with mayo if it is going in a salad, or c) resort to any of the infused or pre-mixed tunas that (in a damning indictment of late capitalism) proliferate in our supermarkets. A salad is no place – if, indeed, one exists – to be experimenting with tuna dressed with tomato and herbs or infused with soy and ginger. </p> \n<h2><strong>Leaves</strong></h2> \n<p>Let he who has never bought a supermarket bagged salad cast the first stone, but you cannot dispute that these sad sacks are a rip-off, and that they are a particular waste of money when it comes to tuna salad. All you want and need, here, is some clean, sweet base crunch. Cos or baby gem lettuce are the way to go; shredded or chopped in chunky hunks that are neither too small nor so big that you need to unhinge your jaw to eat them. Save your swankier salad leaves – peppery watercress, bitter radicchio, that homegrown crop of woody, horrible rocket that never seems to end – for salads where they will make a genuinely effective contribution. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anchovies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Twort/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The salad ingredients</strong></h2> \n<p>Were this a band, you now have your star lead singer (the tuna) and your tight rhythm section (the leaves) in place. It is time to add some mid-range colour: a lead guitarist, a keyboard player, backing singers, perhaps a flautist for that unexpected prog-rock interlude. Now, some of you will read the ingredients listed below and think: “Hang on, this is just a bastardised salad ni&ccedil;oise”, but what of it? The not-quite-salad-ni&ccedil;oise is – to extend this rock group metaphor way past its breaking point – like a band’s classic first album. Later, they will dabble in jazz-funk and start naming their tracks with runic symbols. Which will be interesting. In a way. But that first album, <em>Not Quite Salad Ni&ccedil;oise</em>, is the one you will always come back to.</p> \n<p>Why? Because, primarily, a great tuna salad is a fine balancing act between sharp, salty, fishy flavours and those fresher, spritzier vegetable components – which function almost as an ongoing palate cleanser, as you eat. And, while there is no need to stick faithfully to the original, the salad ni&ccedil;oise remains our most reliable outline guide as regards how to achieve that balance. Moreover, it determines the additional ingredients you might use in an eminently sensible way.</p> \n<p>The full list of acceptable/unacceptable ingredients is as follows:</p> \n<p><strong>YES</strong>: slices of waxy/new potatoes (boiled); anchovies (chopped for thorough distribution, never whole); halved, not overly ripe baby plum tomatoes; cucumber, deseeded and sliced; a small amount of finely chopped sweet red or spring onion; capers; jarred, brined green olives (save those fresh, buttery nocellera to enjoy on their own); chopped or sliced boiled egg; it’s creaminess is a fantastic contrast. A handful of finely chopped leafy, green herbs (parsley, chives, chervil, basil even) is also welcome, but not essential.</p> \n<p><strong>NO</strong>: French/green beans (vile cold, and invariably boiled to a mushy consistency); raw white onion; carrot and beetroot (whose flavours are jarring in this context); croutons (this is not a caesar salad); any chilli or feta stuffed olives (it pains me that this needs pointing out); dull black and/or shrunken purple kalamata-like olives; sliced bell pepper (whose presence in <em>any salad</em> should rightly prompt a lengthy outburst of vociferous “industrial” language). </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0/0_65_5760_3460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not quite right\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not quite right: carrots, feta and dull black olives should be avoided.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Also, on the egg-front, please note that no one wants a tepid-to-warm, still runny poached egg on their tuna salad. There is something deeply unappetising about rogue “hot” ingredients in cold salads and/or salad leaves covered in stringy trails of translucent albumen. Moreover, that running yolk turns any tuna present into gluey, indigestible lumps. You may think a soft poached egg on a tuna salad is sophisticated, clever even. It isn’t.</p> \n<h2><strong>Dressing</strong></h2> \n<p>Step away from the pesto (it makes everything taste of, well, pesto), and dispense with that sharp-elbowed white wine vinegar. All you need here is olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and dijon mustard, all smoothly emulsified in such a way that the character of each ingredient is clear, but elegantly reconciled. Whisk, taste, go.</p> \n<h2><strong>Assembly and plating </strong></h2> \n<p>Serving a salad in a deep cereal bowl makes it difficult to eat. Serving it on a plate always looks wrong. Serving it on slate, meanwhile, is a clear sign that chef needs to stop browsing inspirational tableware catalogues and actually think, practically, about how people eat.</p> \n<p>Instead, line a shallow, wide-rimmed bowl with leaves, and separately (you want those leaves to retain their distinct flavour and crunch) dress and mix the other ingredients, minus the tuna. That, similarly, should be broken into substantive chunks on top and left as a separate complementary dimension of flavour, not doused in vinaigrette.</p> \n<h2><strong>When</strong></h2> \n<p>Lunch or tea – also known, in some part of the UK, as dinner. NB. If anyone in your circle every refers to tuna salad as a “light mid-week supper” you can – after your toes have uncurled from that sudden, excruciating cramp – happily kill them in any gruesome manner you think fitting. There is not a court in the land that would convict you.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink</strong></h2> \n<p>Crisply bitter pale ales; dry, flinty white wines; water. </p> \n<p>So, tuna salad – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6b5fd3d82e4a524640762ffe657f01f71e4e100/0_594_7210_4326/7210.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4326,"width":7210,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Tuna Salad","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1148.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":689,"width":1148,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.

Just don’t forget the sugar…</p>","byline":"Ruby Tandoh","body":"<p>In this age of prolific food photography and Instagramming, it’s no surprise that the gooseberry has fallen out of favour – these fat little berries aren’t the most attractive fruit. Some blush to a reddish purple colour as summer wears on, but most are pale green, watery looking, peppered with little seeds. They have a tendency to sink into a grey-green mush when cooked. Often they’re spiked with light bristles. But if you can look past their appearance, you’ll find them a delight to cook with: sharp, sour, bright – a remedy to summer’s heat and an unlikely kitchen hero.</p> \n<p>In early summer, the gooseberries on the shelves are the young, green ones – plump but firm, just soft enough to pinch between your fingers. The sugar quantities in these recipes reflect that: a lot of sweetness is needed to offset the mouth-puckering sharpness of these under-ripe fruits. As the season goes on, though, the gooseberries grow softer and sweeter. If you’re cooking with riper berries, you might want to tweak the amount of sugar in the sorbet and the crumble filling, to taste.</p> \n<h2><strong>Sweet wine and gooseberry sorbet</strong></h2> \n<p>Because sorbet needs a hefty dose of sugar to stop it from freezing solid, it works best with fruits that can balance that sweetness with acidity. Traditionally that would be lemon, but gooseberry works perfectly too.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />450g gooseberries<br />150-200g caster sugar<br />200ml sweet white wine, such as Muscatel</p> \n<p>1 Simmer the gooseberries, 150g sugar and half the wine together over a low heat for 10 minutes, until the gooseberries are very soft. Strain the mixture through a fine sieve, pressing through as much of the gooseberry juice and pulp as possible. Discard the skins, seeds and stalks.</p> \n<p>2 Decant into a large, lidded plastic container, stir in the remaining wine and add another 50g sugar to taste. Make the sorbet sweeter than seems right, as the flavours will dull when it’s frozen. Leave to cool to room temperature. Transfer to the fridge to thoroughly chill before moving the sorbet to the freezer to set.</p> \n<p>3 Stir vigorously at half-hour intervals for the first couple of hours of freezing time to break up any large ice crystals, then leave to freeze completely overnight. Allow to soften slightly in the fridge prior to serving.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard</strong></h2> \n<p>A gently sweet coconut-crumble topping balances the fruit’s bite without smothering its bright flavour. And as much as I love gooseberries, a 100% gooseberry crumble is a little too tart even for my tastes. To that end, I’ve used a mixture of gooseberry and apple for the filling, the apple lending a welcome textural contrast to the gooseberries’ yielding softness, while mellowing the taste. You can, of course, cook this in a single, larger oven dish if you prefer, baking for 40 minutes or so.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"69a68984a095a2abb8ff055f7fb8394ae34dc80f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438482535/00fbe552-eeff-440d-a8c2-8dd1e957ff6e-460x349.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard\" width=\"460\" height=\"349\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard.

Toss the fruit together with the sugar and set aside while you make the crumble.</p> \n<p>2 Stir the flour, coconut and sugar together in a large bowl, then rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture’s sandy. Divide the fruit between six ramekins, add a thick layer of crumble to each and bake for 30 minutes, until the puddings are bubbling and the topping’s crisp.</p> \n<p>3 While the crumbles are cooking, make the custard. Heat the coconut milk until it’s just about to boil. Whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a separate mixing bowl, then slowly pour the scalding-hot coconut milk into the bowl, whisking constantly. Once you’ve added all the milk, decant the custard back into the pan. Stir it over a very low heat for five minutes or so, until it’s smooth and coats the back of the spoon. It’ll quickly curdle if it’s overcooked, though, so take it off the heat as soon as it’s a pourable custard consistency, and don’t let it boil. Once it’s ready, whisk in the vanilla extract and serve with the hot puddings.</p> \n<h2><strong>Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake</strong></h2> \n<p>This is one of those blessedly easy cakes that you can rustle together the second the craving hits you – just summer fruit scattered through a simple pound cake mix. You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts if you want, but I think the more robust, woody flavour of hazelnut sits well against the bright fruit.<br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"360152a618142c01feb1829d1a11cd699efc1161\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438621227/40e964f2-cc60-41b7-a59e-af3f90f94fd4-460x311.jpeg\" alt=\"Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"311\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake: You can swap ground almonds for the roasted ground hazelnuts.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>If you can’t find the ready-ground stuff in the supermarket, just roast blanched hazelnuts at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 8-10 minutes, until toasted to a rich golden hue, then grind to a fine meal in a coffee grinder or food processor.</p> \n<p>I’ve left this uniced because I don’t think it needs much dressing up, but you could always brush the top with water icing or drizzle with white chocolate if you feel the cake needs a lift.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 6</strong><br />125g unsalted butter, softened<br />125g caster sugar<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />2 large eggs<br />125g plain flour<br />50g roasted ground hazelnuts<br />1&frac14; tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />150g gooseberries<br />75g strawberries</p> \n<p> 1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 2lb/900g loaf tin with baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Beat the butter, sugar and lemon zest together until very light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating each one in thoroughly. In a separate bowl, blend the flour, roasted ground hazelnuts, baking powder and salt, then fold this mixture into the wet ingredients until smooth.</p> \n<p>3 Top and tail and then halve the gooseberries. Halve the strawberries, cutting any very large ones into quarters. Mix just over three quarters of the fruit into the cake batter. Spoon the batter into the prepared tin then scatter the remaining fruit on top and press gently in.</p> \n<p>4 Bake in the preheated oven for around an hour, until the cake is well risen and golden. A knife inserted into the deepest part of the cake should come out clean when the cake is cooked through. Leave to cool completely before serving in thick slices.</p> \n<ul> \n <li><em>Ruby Tandoh is Cook’s baking columnist and the author of Crumb (Chatto &amp; Windus)</em><br /></li> \n</ul>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438081733/f142d923-f513-4239-a90c-038ce4b34ac9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"Ruby's sweet wine and gooseberry sorbet (right), a crunchy gooseberry coconut crumble with coconut custard (bottom) and a moist gooseberry and strawberry hazelnut cake","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/9/1436438482051/f158b7c5-3a69-48f6-9702-d416246df8e4-1020x773.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":773,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gooseberry coconut crumbles with coconut custard.
