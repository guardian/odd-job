It is most closely associated with Liguria, in the north-west of the country, where it bears little resemblance to the soft, finely textured stuff sold in many British supermarkets. Fortunately for fans of the authentic product’s rich, chewy texture and crisp, salty crust, it’s very easy to make at home.</p> \n<h2>The flour</h2> \n<p>Your choice of flour depends very much on what kind of focaccia you’re after. Using plain flour, as in <a href=\"http://www.cookstr.com/recipes/focaccia-with-onions-genoese-style\">Marcella Hazan’s Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking</a>, or even finer “tipo 00” flour as in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/River-Cafe-Classic-Italian-Cookbook/dp/0718153499\">The River Cafe Classic Italian Cookbook</a>, will give you a softer, more tender crumb; while <a href=\"http://lovinghomemade.com/2013/04/25/homemade-focaccia-great-for-sharing/\">Richard Bertinet’s mixture</a> of strong bread flour and coarse semolina in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dough-Richard-Bertinet/dp/1856267628\">his book Dough</a> creates a more robust, chewy texture.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d8ac8676de9148b327d62dcf87d26d2aace0523\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543585407/cd870eee-fd35-4c74-b613-4aceaec86670-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Marcella Hazan's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcella Hazan’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><a href=\"http://kitcheninthesand.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/basic-focaccia-locatellis-foolproof.html\">Giorgio Locatelli</a>’s book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Made-Italy-Stories-Giorgio-Locatelli/dp/1841157023\">Made in Italy explains</a> that, in his restaurant, they use “Italian extra-strong flour, which has a good elasticity and the power to absorb water well”. As it isn’t widely available in this country, he recommends using equal parts strong bread flour and 00 for a similar result, and I agree – his loaf does have a pleasingly springy texture without being quite as stiff as those that use strong flour alone.</p> \n<p>Angela Hartnett* is among that number, but her recipe begins with a <em>biga</em>, or starter, which requires a 24-hour fermentation before use. Her bread has a wonderful chewiness and excellent flavour – almost more like a ciabatta than the focaccia I’m used to – but I’m looking for a loaf that can be made fairly quickly and easily, which rules this step out. If you’re intrigued, however, the recipe from her book Cucina <a href=\"https://suite.io/rebecca-ford/acv2ar\">can be found here</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"700c98da26d0b5f0f52bbf452ed8e72e5e9727ec\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543639835/50ea4806-5888-46c0-b263-ddf248bf5bae-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Richard Bertinet's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Bertinet’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Though I’m not going to put semolina flour in the bread itself, I do like the crunch it lends Bertinet’s version, so I will be dusting the baking tray with it, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2011/sep/08/how-to-cook-perfect-pizza\">as I do when making pizza</a>.</p> \n<p><strong>*</strong><em>Those surprised by the impressively browned crust on Angela’s focaccia should note that it had an accidental second baking after I left it in a cooling oven overnight, and then forgot to take it out when heating the oven the next day.

If you’d like to use fresh yeast instead of the fast-acting variety that I use, substitute 25g, or 12g of ordinary dried yeast, made up as per packet instructions.</p> \n<h2>The liquid</h2> \n<p>All focaccia contains olive oil, from a mere 2 tbsp in Hazan’s recipe to 150ml in the River Cafe version. As well as keeping the dough moist, the oil gives the bread its rich flavour, but I suspect the large quantity is also responsible for the slightly soft crust of the River Cafe loaf, so I’m going to reduce the amount slightly.</p> \n<p>The principal liquid, however – as in any bread – is water, and lots of it; Hartnett warns the novice baker not to be afraid of adding too much: “It can never be too wet – just trust me on this – it will come together. Too much flour and you end up with something resembling a doorstop.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"84c867fbcf82fa4cc4a4ec431613e47da2bd57a2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543485352/3205d26b-b56a-43ce-baa6-0f94c0bb365f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The River Cafe's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The River Cafe’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>She’s right. The drier doughs are indeed denser and heavier, and it’s almost safest – given the difficulties of precision when it comes to hydration, which depends on any number of things from the flour you use to the humidity of the day you bake – to be as vague as the River Cafe, which simply instructs one to add enough water to make a “very soft and pliable dough”. Thus the figure below should simply be taken as a guide. As in Hazan’s recipe, add the liquid in stages until you have a soft but workable dough.</p> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>Perhaps it’s the temperature of my kitchen in comparison to that of a professional one, but I don’t find the short rising time in Locatelli’s recipe sufficient to allow the dough to double in size (which is another argument for using the instructions below as a guideline only – exactly how long everything takes will depend on the circumstances in which you make it), and making sure the dough has time to rise properly will ensure a structurally satisfactory result with plenty of air pockets.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d86e3f2e5d7e4ee81b71e676c3d9df5fd3f9f3dc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543696856/ab2dd7f2-bafc-43e2-ac1d-3ebd199579d8-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Giorgio Locatelli's focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Giorgio Locatelli’s focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It’s easiest to knead wet doughs like this in a food mixer, but if you don’t have one, oil your work surface rather than flouring it, so that you don’t add any more dry ingredients to the mix.</p> \n<p>That said, Locatelli’s bread boasts the best examples of those “dimples” that are such a characteristic feature of the focaccia – I think because his are made directly before baking, as opposed to before the second proof.</p> \n<h2>The baking</h2> \n<p>As with all breads, a very hot oven gives the best results – and baking it on a hot pizza stone or sheet, as Hartnett and Hazan suggest, will give your bread a pleasingly crisp bottom. Spraying a little water into the hot oven to create steam, as the former also recommends, will also help to create a decent crust.</p> \n<h2>The brine</h2> \n<p>Locatelli and others pour a mixture of oil, water and salt on top of their loaves before baking, which, as the River Cafe observes, may seem strange “but the water helps to keep the dough soft and moist in some of the grooves”. Be careful not to overdo it, though, or the loaf won’t brown on top. And don’t feel the need to overload it with salt, either: a mere teaspoon should be quite sufficient given how much there is in the dough.</p> \n<p>Do feel free to add herbs (rosemary sprigs are nice), olives, tomatoes, and so on. And, if you’re feeling really adventurous, the River Cafe even does a dessert version with black grapes and fennel seeds. Personally, I’d draw the line at <a href=\"http://www.thefreshloaf.com/node/30955/salted-caramel-and-apple-focaccia\">this salted-caramel version</a>, but each to their own.</p> \n<h2>The perfect focaccia</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d20f84446ee76b10f6d30fda6acca7d93c3ea95b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434543810111/93d60cdd-269b-442c-a461-64fb77ae19dc-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect focaccia.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect focaccia.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong><em>(Makes one large loaf)</em></strong></p> \n<p><strong>375g strong white bread flour</strong><br /><strong>375g “tipo 00” flour (sometimes sold as pasta flour)</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp fine sea salt</strong><br /><strong>8g active dry yeast</strong><br /><strong>130ml extra-virgin olive oil (100ml for the dough; 30ml for the topping, mixed with 30ml water and 1 tsp salt flakes)</strong><br /><strong>Water</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp coarse semolina or cornmeal (optional)</strong></p> \n<p>Put the flours in a large mixing bowl with the salt and yeast.

Stir together and add more water (I used about 100ml more) until you have a very soft, but not too sticky, dough.</p> \n<p>Knead until soft and elastic; in a food mixer (preferable) on a medium-slow speed for about 7 minutes, or by hand on a lightly oiled work surface for 10-12 minutes. Put the dough on a lightly oiled rimless baking sheet and leave to rise in a draught-free place for 60-90 minutes until roughly doubled in size.</p> \n<p>Knock back the dough, and lightly dust the baking tray with the semolina, if using. Gently press the dough out with your fingers to fit the baking tray. Brush with olive oil and leave to rise again for about another hour, or until doubled in size again. When this time has nearly elapsed, heat the oven to 220C and put a pizza stone or baking tray in there to heat up. If you have a water spray, ready it.</p> \n<p>Whisk together the remaining 30ml olive oil with 30ml water until emulsified. Transfer the dough to you pizza stone or baking tray and poke dimples into the surface of the focaccia with your fingertips. Pour the oil-and-water mixture on top and scatter with the salt flakes, then place in the oven and squirt a little water into the base of the oven. Bake for about 25 minutes, or until golden on top – keep an eye on it.

Add apricots to sweet-tasting duck or to crumble and cream for pudding</p>","byline":"Nigel Slater","body":"<p>A perfect apricot is the most elusive of fruits. As with a peach or a plum, ripeness is all, and a good one can be tricky to track down. When you do finally find a glowingly ripe apricot, honey sweet with a pleasing pinch of acidity, and almost jelly-like flesh, it is worth eating on its own, perhaps at breakfast. Pity then, that most of the apricots we find in the shops are pretty hit and miss.</p> \n<p>At least that is how it used to be. I can’t be the only person to notice that things are looking up and over the past couple of years a decent apricot is less rare, even in supermarkets. After writing them off as a lost cause, I am buying this fruit again.</p> \n<p>If your apricots are not at the point of perfection you have two choices: one is to leave them a day or two and hope they will get there; the other is to cook with them. Even the toughest refuse-to-ripen fruit can be seduced into a decent jam with enough sugar and a bit of slow cooking. But those fruits that are on the verge will work in a pie or tart, deepening in flavour as they soften in the heat. The ripest of mine ended up adding a little tartness to a saut&eacute;ed duck breast this week, while the rest went into a loose-crusted crumbly pie. Only the perfect ones, flushed with pink and freckled with scarlet, made it to the breakfast table.</p> \n<p>The lighter, less cloying dairy produce will flatter a dish of stewed apricots (add a few verbena leaves to the syrup) without smothering. Fromage frais, young, soft goat’s cheeses, faisselle, or an unstrained yogurt are my choice. Don’t waste your time making fools and ices: the flavour will be drowned by the cream. That said, I wouldn’t say no to a trickle of unpasteurised double cream over a warm apricot pie or the crumble tart below.</p> \n<h2>Duck with apricots<br /></h2> \n<p>The duck breast is a neat, lean cut of meat that cooks quickly – qualities that can be negative or positive depending on your outlook. The meat and crisped skin of the duck works nicely with ripe apricots.</p> \n<p>I have added a few radishes for heat and crunch, and green peas as the classic duck accompaniment. Serves 2.</p> \n<p><strong>duck breasts </strong>2, boned, skin on<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>peas </strong>80g<br /><strong>radishes </strong>10<strong> </strong><br /><strong>apricots </strong>6<br /><strong>red-wine vinegar </strong>1 tbsp<br /><strong>butter </strong>a thin slice</p> \n<p>Put the duck breasts, skin side up, on a chopping board and slash in three or four places, going through the skin and about half way down through the meat. Season with salt and black pepper.</p> \n<p>Place a nonstick shallow pan over a moderate heat, pour in the oil, then place the duck, skin side down, in the pan and let the skin brown lightly. Turn the duck over, then cover the pan with a lid and let the breasts cook over a moderate heat for 7 or 8 minutes until they are brown outside and nicely pink within.</p> \n<p>Cook the peas for 4 or 5 minutes in boiling water until tender, then drain them in a colander. Trim the radishes and cut them in half. Halve the apricots and discard their stones.</p> \n<p>Remove the duck breasts to warm plates to rest.

It is essential to use ripe apricots for this, so keep them in a warm place for a day or two if you have bought them under-ripe. This is a deliberately crumbly tart which will firm up as it cools. Serves 6.</p> \n<p>For the crumble crust:<br /><strong>plain flour </strong>200g<br /><strong>sugar </strong>90g, soft, brown<br /><strong>almonds </strong>75g, ground<br /><strong>butter </strong>180g, fridge cold<br /><strong>pine kernels </strong>50g</p> \n<p>For the filling:<br /><strong>apricots </strong>350g, ripe</p> \n<p>You will also need a classic, sloping-sided tart tin measuring approximately 20cm across the base.</p> \n<p>Set the oven at 180C/gas mark 4.</p> \n<p>Put the plain flour into the bowl of a food processor, add the soft brown sugar and the ground almonds. Cut the butter into small pieces, add to the bowl, then process for a few seconds, until the texture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Stir the pine kernels into the crumb mixture.</p> \n<p>Tip two-thirds of the crumble mixture into a mixing bowl and add two tablespoons of water to it. Stir the mixture so it resembles damp, slightly sticky crumbs. Press the mixture into the base and sloping sides of the tart tin. Take it slowly, pushing down firmly with a large floured spoon or your floured hand. Don’t worry if it looks rough – you want an open, crumbly texture and it will be covered with fruit later.</p> \n<p>Bake the tart case for 15 minutes, until it is pale brown in colour and firm to the touch. Remove from the oven. Halve the apricots and discard the stones. Place the apricot halves, cut side down, on the pastry crust. Scatter the reserved crumble over the apricots, almost covering them.</p> \n<p>Bake the tart for about 40 minutes until the crust is quite dark and crisp. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 20 minutes before serving. Cream or cr&egrave;me fra&icirc;che will be needed.</p> \n<p><em>Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></em></p> \n<p><em>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540104147/duck-with-apricots-in-a-b-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'The meat and crisped skin works nicely with ripe apricots': duck with apricots.\r Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer","credit":"Jonathan Lovekin/Observer","altText":"duck with apricots, in a bowl","cleanCaption":"'The meat and crisped skin works nicely with ripe apricots': duck with apricots.\r Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin for the Observer"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434540277740/d8f10d5f-c28c-4e81-9839-790d49f5fec8-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘It will firm up as it cools’: apricot crumble tart.

Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>It might seem like madness to use around 65 cloves of garlic in just three recipes. But with this particular allium, it’s all about the way it’s cooked, rather than the number of cloves you use.</p> \n<p>The harsh and sometimes metallic note that can linger when using raw garlic is a result of the sulphurous compounds in each clove. The more a clove is crushed and minced, the more the cell membranes are broken up, and the more those compounds are activated and released. When you only gently crush the cloves, or roast them whole, however, no such activation takes place. The effect of slow-roasting instead breaks down the chains of fructose sugars in each clove, producing something markedly sweet, decidedly mellow and not at all mad.</p> \n<h2><strong>Garlicky summer broth</strong></h2> \n<p>Use as many fresh young summer vegetables as you can here: baby courgettes, runner beans, French beans, broccolini, spring onions, peas, baby carrots, asparagus, gem lettuce – anything that grabs your eye and tastebuds. Cooking times will vary from a few minutes to a few seconds (baby carrots and courgettes take about two minutes to blanch, beans, peas and broccolini a minute or two, while lettuce and spring onion need just a dip in the boiling water). Leave the veg whole if they are small, cut them in half lengthways or, in the case of lettuce, into wedges. If you’re not vegetarian, you can add an anchovy fillet or two to the salsa and use chicken stock instead of vegetable, while feta, mature pecorino or soft goat’s cheese in the herb paste will add character and depth. Serves six.</p> \n<p><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>20 garlic cloves, peeled and lightly crushed with the flat of a knife </strong><br /><strong>200ml Pernod</strong><br /><strong>2 litres vegetable stock</strong><br /><strong>1 dried Iranian lime, pierced 2-3 times (optional)</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp black peppercorns</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>10g thyme sprigs</strong><br /><strong>8 sage leaves</strong><br /><strong>20g parsley sprigs</strong><br /><strong>15g tarragon sprigs</strong><br /><strong>1kg assorted mixed baby vegetables</strong></p> \n<p>For the herb paste<br /><strong>1 whole head garlic</strong><br /><strong>30g parsley leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>15g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>Zest from 1 lemon</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Start with the broth. Put a large saucepan on a high heat and add the oil. Once hot, add the garlic and fry for a minute or two, stirring constantly, until golden brown. Add the Pernod, leave to bubble for two minutes, until reduced by half, then add the stock, dried lime (if using), peppercorns and a teaspoon of salt. Tie the herbs together with string and add to the pot, bring to a boil, turn the heat to medium-low and simmer for 40 minutes, until about a litre of liquid remains. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, make the herb paste. Cut 1cm off the top of the head of garlic, exposing the cloves, then wrap in foil. Roast for an hour, until the flesh is very soft and caramelised, remove from the oven, leave to cool for 10 minutes, then squeeze out the cloves into a food processor. Add the remaining paste ingredients and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, blitz smooth and set aside.</p> \n<p>While the broth is cooking, also blanch your vegetables in salted water until just tender (see introduction for timings) and refresh under cold water.</p> \n<p>When you’re ready to serve, strain the stock though a fine sieve, to remove the aromatics, then return to the pot. Bring to a boil, add the blanched veg, return to a boil, then take off the heat. Divide the stock and vegetables between six shallow bowls, top each with a spoonful of herb paste and serve.</p> \n<h2><strong>Baked rice with confit tomatoes and garlic</strong></h2> \n<p>The fruity flavour of the ancho chillies works really well here, so try to seek them out: they are available in most large supermarkets. You can use larger beets and shallots instead of baby ones (just cut them into smaller pieces), though the dish does look better with whole baby veg. Serves eight as a side or six as a main.</p> \n<p><strong>2-3 dried ancho chillies</strong><br /><strong>650g cherry tomatoes</strong><br /><strong>25 garlic cloves, peeled</strong><br /><strong>10 baby shallots, peeled and trimmed (250g net weight)</strong><br /><strong>25g bunch coriander, tied with string</strong><br /><strong>10g bunch thyme, tied with string</strong><br /><strong>100ml olive oil</strong><br /><strong>15 baby beetroots, unpeeled, scrubbed clean and trimmed (450g)</strong><br /><strong>350g basmati rice</strong><br /><strong>Salt and black pepper</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 160C/320F/gas mark 2&frac12;. Put the ancho chillies in a medium bowl, pour over 100ml of boiling water and leave to soak for 10 minutes. Strain over a bowl, to catch the liquid, then tear the chillies into 2-3cm strips (you don’t need to discard the seeds, because anchos are not particularly hot).</p> \n<p>Arrange the tomatoes, garlic, shallots and herbs in a large, high-sided casserole dish (about 23cm x 32cm). Pour over the oil, then scatter over a half-teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Add the strips of ancho chilli to the dish, pour over their reserved soaking liquor and roast for an hour, until the vegetables are soft, dark and caramelised.</p> \n<p>While the vegetables are cooking, fill a medium saucepan with plenty of water and bring to a boil. Add the beetroot and leave to bubble for 15-20 minutes, until cooked through. Drain and, once cool enough to handle, peel off and discard the skins, then set aside.</p> \n<p>Remove the confit vegetables from the oven. Lift out and discard the herbs and dot the beetroot around and about, taking care not to mix them together so the colour doesn’t leech. Sprinkle the rice evenly over the top and set aside.</p> \n<p>Turn up the oven to 220C/425F/gas mark 7. Fill a small saucepan with 800ml of water, and add three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a good grind of black pepper. Bring to a boil, then pour evenly over the rice. Seal the tray tightly with foil and bake for 25 minutes, until the rice is cooked. Remove from the oven, set aside, covered, for 10 minutes to settle and rest, then serve hot.</p> \n<h2><strong>Charred mixed peppers with roasted garlic sauce</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-6c5359a7-0af9-450b-bfa2-5f77d2abe6b2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434380528107/c7a4331e-c24b-445c-835d-58be94262d42-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's charred mixed peppers with roasted garlic sauce\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s charred mixed peppers with roasted garlic sauce: a wide range of peppers is the secret to making this dish look and taste extra-special.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian.

Get as wide a range as you can of whatever you like (whenever I see them, I always get some of the long, light green Turkish peppers, for example, because they char really well): just keep to the total weight of peppers in the ingredients list. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>170g jalape&ntilde;o peppers (about 10)</strong><br /><strong>800g romano peppers (about 8, a mix of yellow, red and orange, if possible)</strong><br /><strong>90g Padr&oacute;n peppers (about 8)</strong><br /><strong>60ml olive oil</strong><br /><strong>10g coriander leaves, roughly chopped, plus 5g extra to serve</strong><br /><strong>10g mint leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong></p> \n<p>For the roast garlic and yoghurt sauce<br /><strong>1 whole head garlic, plus one extra garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>300g Greek yoghurt</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp lemon juice</strong><br /><strong>Salt and white pepper</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Start with the garlic for the sauce. Cut 1cm off the top of the head of garlic, exposing the cloves, then wrap in foil. Roast for an hour, until the cloves are soft and caramelised. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool.</p> \n<p>Place all the peppers in a large bowl with two tablespoons of olive oil and a teaspoon of salt. Mix and set aside. Put a ridged griddle pan on a high heat and, when hot, add the peppers, and cook in batches, turning so that they char lightly on all sides – this should take about two minutes for the smaller peppers and up to six for the romanos. Transfer to a parchment-lined baking tray and roast for 10 minutes, until soft. Remove from the oven and set aside.</p> \n<p>Put the coriander and mint in a mortar with the remaining oil and eighth of a teaspoon of salt. Pound to a thick paste and set aside.</p> \n<p>Squeeze the garlic cloves out of their skins into a medium bowl. Whisk with a tablespoon of yoghurt and, once smooth, add the rest of the yoghurt, the oil, fresh garlic, lemon juice, a third of a teaspoon of salt and a pinch of white pepper.</p> \n<p>Put the peppers on a serving plate and spoon over about half the garlic sauce – you don’t want to cover the peppers completely, so serve the remaining sauce in a bowl on the side. Drizzle over the coriander paste, followed by a sprinkle of fresh coriander, and serve.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/15/1434380273790/Yotam-Ottolenghis-garlick-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yotam Ottolenghi's garlicky summer broth: delicious just as it is (though, for non-vegetarians, an anchovy fillet or some feta or percorino wouldn't go amiss).

Just another day at the office, then. My crime that day was to have said during an episode of <em>MasterChef</em> that a dessert “looked like the sort of thing served at a cheap wedding full of regret held at a hotel on a ring road”. My correspondent’s stepdaughter had apparently just got married at a ring road hotel and it had been lovely. “I’m sure it was,” I replied, “but was it also full of regret? Because if it wasn’t, it isn’t covered by my critique.” I may be a snob, but I’m a precise snob.</p> \n<p>The touchiness shouldn’t have surprised me. When it comes to food at weddings people are like that. A wedding is one of life’s great set piece events, upon which the compass flickers. Accordingly everything about them must be perfect, even when everything plainly isn’t. And now it’s June, and wedding season is upon us. For the next few months many of us will be putting on suits and frocks smelling of dry cleaning fluid, and tramping into baggy marquees where we will eat some of the worst, most overpriced food ever inflicted upon us by people who claim to be our dearest friends. And then, regardless of how dismal it all was, we will loudly proclaim the opposite. In the coming months more lies will be told about the quality of lunch and dinner than in the rest of the year put together.</p> \n<p>We are meant to be experiencing a British food revolution, and in many ways we are. There are better restaurants than ever before. But in the business of mass catering we are generally awful. I say generally. Obviously, if you run a catering firm and you’re limbering up to complain, I don’t mean you. You’re brilliant. Likewise, the food at your wedding was obviously fabulous. It’s everyone else.</p> \n<p>Everyone else is responsible for dry canap&eacute;s that taste only of margarine and complacency. Everyone else is responsible for desiccated lumps of yesterday’s pre-cooked chicken the colour of an old stained sink; for sauces that could creosote fences and vegetables so overboiled you could suck them through a straw; for cream desserts that have split, and overbaked tarts with pastry like walnut shells. And the cost! I only use exclamation marks for shouting, which is what I’m doing. THE COST! Despite economies of scale, caterers charge more for this dismal crud than the price of a quality restaurant meal and rising. Why are they allowed to get away with it?</p> \n<p>Precisely because it’s a special event, and nobody likes to admit one of those isn’t actually that special. Plus, avoiding the pitfalls of mass catering dreariness requires a certain radicalism: the willingness to do away with the awful formally plated main course, to sack the poor exploited teenage waitresses and instead concentrate spend on the cooking. The problem is that weddings generally involve young people and for all their youthful irreverence, young people can be rather “small c” conservative. A wedding is a grown-up event, and they have a mythologised notion of what grown-up looks like, which includes a marquee and chicken the colour of a stained sink.</p> \n<p>Recently the savings expert Martin Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/cheaper-weddings\">website </a>said that, when booking a wedding reception at a hotel, tell them it’s for a party rather than for nuptials. Apparently hotels charge more the moment they hear it’s a wedding. This is good advice. It won’t stop the food being crap, but at least it won’t cost you as much.</p> \n<p><em>Tell us about your wedding-day catering disasters and triumphs below</em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T13:30:07Z","lastModified":"2015-06-20T23:10:21Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":372,"contributors":[{"name":"Jay Rayner","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/3/13/1394733739943/JayRayner.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/jayrayner"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Weddings","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/weddings","webTitle":"Weddings"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Jay Rayner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/jayrayner"}}],"series":{"title":"Happy eater","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/happy-eater"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49kzy","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"‘The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.’ Photograph: Alamy","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCaption":"‘The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.’","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}},"importance":4,"kicker":{"title":"Happy eater"},"snap":{"title":"Wedding season is here: bring on the crimes against food","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/16/wedding-season-crimes-against-food-jay-rayner"},"showQuotedHeadline":false,"sublinks":[],"images":[{"type":"default","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434037088538/8ce08c37-1c1b-4a4a-8303-4d2a79721723-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"'The sauces could creosote fences, and the pastry is like walnut shells.'","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}}]},{"title":"Jack Monroe's recipes for life / Jack Monroe’s lentil, bean and kale salad recipe","rawTitle":"Jack Monroe’s lentil, bean and kale salad recipe","item":{"type":"article","id":"lifeandstyle/2015/apr/15/jack-monroe-lentil-bean-kale-salad-recipe","title":"Jack Monroe’s lentil, bean and kale salad recipe","trailText":"Take this healthy, substantial salad to work for lunch and you’ll be full of beans all afternoon","standFirst":"<p>Take this healthy, substantial salad to work for lunch and you’ll be full of beans all afternoon</p>","byline":"Jack Monroe","body":"<p>Move over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/30/jack-monroe-kale-pesto-paste-recipe\">kale pesto</a>, there’s a new kid in town.

Gather around in as tight a huddle as our bulging stomachs will allow, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How to Eat</a> is going where others are too complacent to tread. Yes, we are opening a Tupperware pandora’s box and taking a large bite out of the humble cheese sandwich. Identified <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11537804/Britains-favourite-lunch-The-humble-cheese-sandwich.html\">last month</a> as the nation’s favourite weekday lunchtime repast, this is not just a snack but one of the building blocks of the British identity. One that, thankfully, has recently been exonerated after accusations it had played a principal role <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gavrilo-princips-sandwich-79480741/?no-ist\">in starting the first world war</a>. As ever, below the line, please choose your words caerphilly. Do not turn the air blue. If necessary, brie the feta man.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cheese </strong></h2> \n<p>Call me a militant, but I feel it is essential. No matter how vigorously vegans dispute that point. But what cheese should you use and should it be sliced or grated? These are questions which go to the very heart of what you want, not just out of this sandwich, but life. Do you want frivolous novelty? Do you crave impractical continental ingredients which, somehow, make you feel more sophisticated? Or do you want proven, steadfast flavour combinations?</p> \n<p>Fundamentally, there are very few cheeses that truly work in a sandwich. If you wish to avoid creating a dry, claggy sanger of a muddled, indeterminate character, you need to use something hard, waxy and tangy in the lincolnshire poacher or mature cheddar line, which you may want to augment with a little red leicester or double gloucester. Wonderful as they may be elsewhere, a sandwich is no place for the crumbly and/or dense likes of feta; wensleydale; almost all Lancashire cheeses; goat’s cheese (that is a salad cheese, no matter how you moisten it with beetroot); brie (especially when paired, egregiously, with cranberries); any of the blue cheeses; cream cheese*; cheshire; stinking bishop or any other gooey cheeses which must be sealed in a lead Hazmat container in your fridge, to stop your neighbours complaining about the smell.</p> \n<p>Of course, manchego, Parmesan and halloumi are not sandwich cheeses. Nor, unless you want to spend half the sandwich spraining your tongue, trying to dislodge a wad of bread and cheese that has welded itself to the roof of your mouth, are processed cheese slices and (my beloved) Dairylea. Any added fruit or added herb cheeses are, naturally, disqualified because they are an offence against god. </p> \n<p>If you are wondering about mozzarella’s absence, it only plays a serious part in hot sandwiches, often partnered with pesto. In a cold sandwich, it is a curiously rubbery, often slightly granular interloper, which delivers scant milky flavour.</p> \n<p>* Unless that cream cheese is on a bagel with smoked salmon of course, but, then, that is more a smoked salmon sandwich than a cheese one. </p> \n<h2><strong>Slice or grate?</strong> </h2> \n<p>If creating a “<a href=\"https://www.greggs.co.uk/menu/sandwiches/cheddar-cheese-savoury-/\">cheese savoury</a>” filling with celery, carrot, onion etc, then grating the cheese is necessary to ensure that all the ingredients are thoroughly intermingled. If you bind that mix with something (mayonnaise), and diligently press the mix into the bread with a fork as you fill the sandwich, any spillages should be minimised. However, a grated cheese sandwich without that binding agent is a nightmare. As you will have observed at weddings and funerals, after returning from the buffet table, every time you pick up your sandwich, a bit of grated cheese falls out on to your plate, shirt, the table or floor. You end up picking most of the cheese up with your fingers in between bites of your, by now, almost empty sandwich. After a while, it really grates.</p> \n<p>Slicing is eminently preferable. It ensures complete crust-to-crust coverage and eradicates spillage. However, be aware that anything above a thickness of 5mm is overkill. Constructing a cheese sandwich is a delicate balancing act. You must ensure flavour but also that the drier constituents of the sandwich (bread, cheese), do not dominate in a way that makes that sandwich a chore. </p> \n<h2><strong>Bread </strong></h2> \n<p>Whether you prefer to call it or “doorstep” or “doorstop”, my message is this: please cut your slices thinner. A great hulking sandwich appeals to us in an intuitive way. It is aesthetically pleasing. It evokes a prelapsarian past of bucolic rural plenty, a merrie England which probably only ever existed in the minds of the fiendish admen who created it. However, that fat sandwich is also a major pain in the posterior to eat. Unless you are using a bread so fresh it is still warm from the baker’s oven (which in cafes and pubs or at home, 98.9% of us are not), that is a massive wad of carbs and solidified fat to chew on. It takes some serious masticating. I do not want to swig tea or beer with each mouthful (thus, washing away the flavours of the sandwich), in order to get it down. Moreover, the primary flavour of a cheese sandwich should be cheese not bread – that is the star of the show, let it shine. Restrain yourself to slices of no more than 1cm in thickness.</p> \n<p>A good-quality soft, white, impeccably fresh loaf is the ideal, although ordinary supermarket white sliced is entirely serviceable (Warburton’s toastie is How To Eat’s recommended brand). Indeed, that is one of the joys of the cheese sandwich. It is one of those food items, like ice-cream or bacon, which can never be truly bad. From the cheapest block cheese to the finest small-batch, extra-matured cheddar, from the woolliest white sliced to the priciest artisan sourdough (its lactic piquancy always welcome), all cheese sandwiches tickle the pleasure centres at some level. So long, that is, as you haven’t made it on worthy wholegrain or the kind of seeded loaf that is like chewing through the leg of a wicker chair. Brown and darker rye breads have their place, but certainly not on a cheese sandwich where a lack of moisture is a constant threat. </p> \n<h2><strong>A short note on soft baps … </strong></h2> \n<p>Ordinarily, not the go-to sandwich bread. But if out for a picnic or travelling, there is something uniquely brilliant about a cheese and tomato bap that has been wrapped in Clingfilm for hours, and allowed to come to room temperature, so that the cheese begins to sweat out its oils and the juice from the tomatoes has had plenty of time to soak into the bread. Add a little salt, and even the blandest British tomatoes and the dullest processed cheddar will amalgamate into a flavour bomb that is so wet at its centre you can almost slurp it down.</p> \n<p>That point about temperature is a key for all cheese sandwiches, of course. Get all the components out of the fridge and let them warm up before constructing your sandwich. As Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/11/sandwich-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall\">rightly observed</a> in reference to chilled supermarket butties: “Who wants bread, butter and cheese at 3C?”</p> \n<h2><strong>Desirable extras</strong> </h2> \n<p>Raw onion (preferably red or mild Spanish, to limit halitosis); spring onion; caramelised onion; Branston Pickle (I am a late convert, but yes); pickled gherkins; good homemade coleslaw with cabbage; baby gem or iceberg lettuce for sweet, refreshing crunch. Please note: you generally only need one of those extras <em>plus</em> iceberg lettuce. That is, in order to retain the structural integrity of your sandwich and to ensure that all the ingredients can fully express themselves.</p> \n<h2><strong>Borderline extras </strong></h2> \n<p>Celery (banal on its own, but acceptable in a cheese savoury mix; see also carrot); tomato (ripe and salted); apple chutney (not overly sweet); a handful of crushed ready salted or cheese-and-onion crisps, for texture (but only on a very liberally, mayo-moistened sandwich).</p> \n<h2><strong>Undesirable extras </strong></h2> \n<p>Ham, chicken or tuna (what you have there is a ham, chicken or tuna sandwich, in which the cheese has been relegated to a “seasoning” role; see also fish fingers); piccalilli; cucumber (beyond pointless); beetroot; egg; horseradish; Marmite; and also Worcestershire sauce, tabasco, cayenne pepper or any other pushy, sharp-elbowed sauce and seasoning which people occasionally and idiotically use to try to jazz-up “cheese savoury”.</p> \n<h2><strong>Spreads </strong></h2> \n<p>Butter. Real butter. Not margarine. Not a low-fat spread. Not that voodoo ersatz butter that is spreadable straight from the fridge. Life is short. Accept no substitutes. Oh … and, of course, every cheese sandwich needs a dollop of mayonnaise. For moisture, for slick mouthfeel, for a little vinegary tang.</p> \n<h2><strong>The cut </strong></h2> \n<p>Horizontally through the middle of the bread. Never diagonally. Eat the less enjoyable “square edged” bottom half first, as it has the larger, drier crust area, and then sit back and savour that relatively luxurious, rounded top-half.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink </strong><br /></h2> \n<p>A huge, Sports Direct-sized mug of brick-red tea, or a zippy, lightly bitter golden or pale ale. </p> \n<h2><strong>When </strong></h2> \n<p>Dinner or tea. Although, I find the cheese sandwich is a reasonably effective breakfast hangover remedy, for those light-to-moderate days of fuzziness, when you still have the wherewithal to actually make yourself a sandwich.</p> \n<p>So, the cheese sandwich – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819360472/3d155c8f-2915-478e-b543-aa42776458a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"The full-on rustic approach … not without its pitfalls.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-05T10:00:22Z","lastModified":"2015-05-05T10:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":772,"contributors":[{"name":"Tony Naylor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tonynaylor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Sandwiches","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/sandwiches","webTitle":"Sandwiches"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tony Naylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/tonynaylor"}}],"series":{"title":"How to eat","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48v53","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819360472/3d155c8f-2915-478e-b543-aa42776458a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The full-on rustic approach … not without its pitfalls.

It’s just as good on toast, through ice-cream, on your little finger as in is in this cake, so I doubt you’ll have trouble using it up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3e0925e898bb8e70aace4a395bf453e76f061879\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434624197142/b073f732-08a3-4567-a334-4ad5c80a1347-460x300.jpeg\" alt=\"Summer pineapple camomile cake\" width=\"460\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ruby’s summery pineapple camomile cake.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>You can use camomile teabags if you can’t find the loose flowers – just swap 1 teabag per tablespoon of dried camomile buds. They’re less potent, though, so give them plenty of time to steep and do source loose camomile if you can. Health food stores sometimes have it, or look online at souschef.co.uk.</p> \n<p><strong>Serves 10-12</strong><br />250g unsalted butter<br />100ml milk<br />6 tbsp dried camomile buds<br />300g caster sugar<br />Zest of &frac12; lemon<br />2 tsp vanilla extract<br />4 large eggs<br />350g plain flour<br />3 tsp baking powder<br />&frac14; tsp salt</p> \n<p><strong> For the curd</strong><br />2 large egg yolks<br />1&frac12; tbsp cornflour<br />40g caster sugar<br />100ml pineapple juice<br />Juice from 1 lemon<br />1 tbsp unsalted butter</p> \n<p><strong> For the icing</strong><br />225g unsalted butter<br />6 tbsp dried camomile flowers<br />300g white chocolate<br />200g icing sugar<br />Zest of &frac12; lemon<br />15-25ml milk, if needed</p> \n<p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Grease and line two 20cm round cake tins – preferably loose-bottomed or springform ones.</p> \n<p>2 Combine the butter, milk and camomile in a pan and set over a low heat until the butter has completely melted and the mixture has just begun to simmer. Remove from the heat and leave to cool and infuse for 5 minutes or so before straining into a large mixing bowl, leaving the camomile flowers behind while squeezing as much liquid from them as possible.</p> \n<p>3 Add the sugar, lemon zest and vanilla extract to the infused butter mixture and whisk to combine. Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well between each addition. In a separate bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt before adding this dry mixture to the wet ingredients. Whisk until the batter is smooth, then divide it between the prepared tins.</p> \n<p>4 Bake for 25-30 minutes, until well-risen and golden brown. A small knife inserted into the middle of each cake should emerge clean. Leave to cool in their tins before unmoulding.</p> \n<p>5 While the cakes are cooking and cooling, make the curd. Whisk the egg yolks, cornflour and sugar together in a small pan, then slowly add the pineapple and lemon juices. Set the pan over a low heat and stir constantly for 5-10 minutes – as long as it takes for the curd to reach the consistency of very thick custard. It’ll be resolutely liquid for the first few minutes, but don’t give up on it. As soon as it’s ready and just about to start bubbling, remove it from the heat, stir in the butter and leave it to cool to room temperature.</p> \n<p>6 To prepare the icing, melt the butter with the camomile over a low heat until the butter starts to bubble. Remove from the heat and leave to cool for 10 minutes before sieving out the camomile flowers. While the butter cools a little, chop the white chocolate into small chunks and melt in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water (you can also melt it carefully in the microwave in short bursts, if you’d rather). Stir the melted white chocolate into the slightly cooled, strained butter and leave to cool to room temperature.</p> \n<p>7 Once the butter and chocolate mixture has cooled, put the icing in the fridge for 20 minutes to firm to the consistency of softened, creamed butter. Stir it at 5 minute intervals to avoid lumpiness. Once it’s thick and smooth, add the icing sugar and lemon zest and gently mix. Add a dash of milk, if necessary, to give a spreadable, buttercream texture.</p> \n<p>8 Spread a few dollops of the curd on top of one cake layer, sandwich it with the other, then spread the icing evenly over the top and sides of the sandwich. Drizzle the top with a little more curd or scatter with dried camomile flowers.</p> \n<h2><strong>Orange blossom panna cotta with strawberries</strong></h2> \n<p>The simplicity of panna cotta isn’t something to be messed with, but a drop or two of orange blossom water really works to bring out the delicacy of this dessert. Make sure you leave plenty of cooling and setting time in making these for a special meal.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6648d474b29c12decac8cd6b3d75fdc2cbfa8a9f\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434624146740/92d56901-7c72-4db9-bdb2-e80a302c9d95-460x303.jpeg\" alt=\"Panna cotta\" width=\"460\" height=\"303\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Orange-blossom panna cotta.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Makes 4</strong><br />3 leaves gelatine, cut into large pieces<br />300ml whole milk<br />90g caster sugar<br />Zest of 1 orange, coarsely grated<br />100ml single cream<br />Orange-blossom water, to taste<br />175g strawberries<br />30g caster sugar</p> \n<p>1 Soak the gelatine leaves in cold water for 5 minutes or so, until softened. Meanwhile, heat the milk, sugar and orange zest until scalding hot.</p> \n<p>2 Drain the liquid from the gelatine pieces, then add the pieces to the hot milk mixture, whisking immediately to combine. Set back over a low heat and bring to the boil. As soon as the mixture starts to simmer, take it off the heat, stir in the single cream and add orange blossom water, to taste. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve to remove the orange zest.</p> \n<p>3 Lightly grease 4 individual 150ml pudding moulds or ramekins and divide the panna cotta mixture between them. Leave to cool to room temperature before placing in the fridge for a few hours to chill and set. I find it’s best to leave them overnight, but as long as you can spare2-3 hours of fridge time, you should be fine.</p> \n<p>4 Hull and quarter the strawberries, then toss them in a bowl with the caster sugar and a few more drops of orange-blossom water, to taste. Place in the fridge to macerate while the puddings set.</p> \n<p>5 To unmould the panna cotta, carefully dip the bottoms of each basin or ramekin in hot water for a few seconds before quickly inverting the pudding on to a plate. If the panna cotta sticks stubbornly in its mould, try running a small knife around the edge toor dipping into the hot water for a few moments more. Serve with the macerated strawberries.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434623412452/9a7fb191-af47-4f0e-9b05-14614d95a2d9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"A summery pineapple and camomile cake and an elegant orange-blossom panna cotta with strawberries.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434624197558/c775ed2d-c40f-4733-9309-9760900c303c-620x405.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":405,"width":620,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ruby’s summery pineapple camomile cake.
