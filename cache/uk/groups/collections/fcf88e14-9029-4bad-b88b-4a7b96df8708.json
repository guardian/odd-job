There’s even an international chain dedicated to them. So, are they worth adopting?</p> \n<h2>The preparation</h2> \n<p>If you buy your chicken wings whole, you’ll need to separate them into the rather winsome sounding drumettes and flats. Drying them before cooking, preferably for a few hours in the fridge, as <a href=\"http://www.eburypublishing.co.uk/editions/the-chicken-book-the-definitive-cookbook-every-chicken-recipe-youll-ever-need/9780091959722\">Catherine Phipps suggests in her book Chicken</a>, or, if you don’t have the time, at least drying them with paper towels just before cooking, will help the skin to crisp up (and a chicken wing, given the scanty meat involved, stands or falls on its skin). I don’t think the wings require seasoning with salt and garlic powder, as Phipps recommends, though; although this gives them a good flavour when eaten au naturel, it clashes with the spicy, intensely savoury sauce they are tossed in later, which may be why she admits to a weakness for the odd handful “as is”.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c96019d2be265cd45012dee276677b6c8cfbb78e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436351593692/f877aa18-8ee2-4987-ad52-51494c228925-460x381.jpeg\" alt=\"Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"381\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Catherine Phipps’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The coating</h2> \n<p>Early recipes don’t include any coating – the chicken is just fried as is. The Joy of Cooking, however, coats the wings with seasoned flour, while <a href=\"http://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1858-buffalo-wings\">Cook’s Illustrated goes for cornflour</a> for “an even crispier exterior”. They’re delicious, but turn flabby and disappointing far more quickly than the plain variety, especially when doused in hot buttery sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9abf4f1c08123836d631888fd03cf68568dca763\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352238844/f59dfc50-8373-4def-867d-6216d7c206c7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Joy of Cooking's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Joy of Cooking’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The cooking</h2> \n<p>True bar buffalo wings are deep-fried, but many home recipes shy away from this – as Phipps perspicaciously observes: “The coating makes the wings literally drip in butter anyway, I prefer to bake them.” Alton Brown, <a href=\"http://altonbrown.com/buffalo-wings/\">the scientifically minded American television chef</a>, avoids deep-frying on the basis that “most American cooks lack access to commercial fryers” – though, presumably, they do have saucepans and stoves, which is all you need to deep-fry something. He steams them first, “to render out a lot of the fat”, then cools them to “tighten the skin” before baking. I’m impressed at how crisp both baked versions are, but the meat inside is undeniably dryer than the deep-fried wings from Saveur, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated. If you’re really against frying, however, Phipps’s recipe is considerably less faff than Brown’s, and works just as well – bake at 220C for 20-25 minutes on each side.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"350e244f2af06922443b5aad7220937a38de25b7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352329320/5147c0f8-59d7-4048-94e2-cba2e2869d9c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Alton Brown's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alton Brown’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The sauce</h2> \n<p>The original recipe is as simple as you’d expect for something allegedly knocked up on the spur of the moment in a bar: hot sauce and butter (or margarine if you’re to believe Saveur, though I can’t bring myself to give it a try because I really don’t want to eat deep-fried chicken smothered in tasteless fat). Brown adds garlic, which I really like, and Phipps, The Joy of Cooking and Cook’s Illustrated all stick some vinegar in there, too, which accentuates the natural edge of the sauce and balances the richness of the butter nicely.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41820286efa3aef3ce1d626b1ed2e0aedeaeebe9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352431066/f92fef42-2111-4a2f-9d45-8550cd403cdf-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Saveur's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saveur’s buffalo wings.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most recipes call for a specific brand of hot sauce: <a href=\"https://www.franksredhot.com/\">Frank’s</a>, which is a sour, piquant condiment made from cayenne peppers in Missouri, but, though it is available in this country, I think you can use whichever one you happen to like. Indeed, Cook’s Illustrated found that most of its tasters found Frank’s rather mild, so they mix it with something “a little more dynamic” but, as long as it’s hot and sour, it will work. That said, I do like the pinch of dark brown sugar the magazine adds to “round out the flavours” – but, as these depend on which sauce you use, I’d recommend tasting and adjusting to suit your palate. And, though it’s sacrilege, I’d also suggest drizzling the dressing over the wings, rather than tossing them in it – they stay crisper that way.</p> \n<h2>The blue-cheese sauce</h2> \n<p>And what’s the natural accompaniment for spicy deep-fried chicken wings? Why, a rich, salty blue-cheese dip, of course – and it should be intensely savoury, which is why The Joy of Cooking’s roquefort works better than Phipps’s stilton or Cook’s Illustrated’s mild, creamy blue. Mayonnaise supplies body, and sour cream or creme fraiche the requisite tanginess; buttermilk is too runny here, pleasingly American as it sounds. A dash of vinegar accentuates the tang, along with just a splash of sweet and intensely savoury Worcestershire sauce.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1b0378c48309d07d7d2b47f74070fcb405d7518\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/8/1436352561594/2eda6752-809a-4fd9-988b-8ee0eeb598eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Cook's Illustrated's buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cook’s Illustrated’s buffalo wings with blue-cheese sauce.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>I’m not keen on raw onion or dried garlic powder (the other flavours are harsh enough), and parsley, though pretty, is distractingly fresh and peppery, unlike the more harmonious chive.</p> \n<p>Serve with carrot and celery sticks and pretend it’s healthy.</p> \n<p><strong><em>(serves 4 with sides)</em></strong><br /><em>For the wings</em><br />16 wing pieces (or 8 whole wings)<br />Neutral oil, to fry<br />40g butter<br />2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />120ml sour hot sauce, eg Frank’s <br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1 tsp dark brown sugar<br />2 carrots, peeled and cut into batons<br />2 celery sticks, destringed and cut into lengths</p> \n<p><em>For the blue-cheese sauce</em><br />100g crumbled roquefort<br />6 tbsp sour cream or creme fraiche<br />2 tbsp mayonnaise<br />2 tsp cider vinegar<br />1/4 tsp Worcestershire sauce<br />Small bunch of chives, finely chopped (optional)</p> \n<p>If you have time, remove the wings from their packet and put them on a rack above a bowl or tray in the fridge for between 1 and 12 hours.

A jam, glowing jewel-like on the breakfast table, can be a fine thing if you have bothered to remove the stones; hell if you haven’t. But, other than that, cherries are best eaten from the bag or, better still, served cold, in a bowl of ice cubes that you have crushed to a near slush-puppy texture.</p> \n<p>An exception is a pickled cherry. A snap of sweet and sour to bring out the best in a slice of ham, a fillet of oily fish such as a tuna steak or a fillet of silver-skinned mackerel. When I say pickled, I don’t mean the fruit should be kept lurking in a jar of malt vinegar and spices for six months. I mean a quick 20-minute pickle, bright as a button, with star anise, black peppercorns, mild red wine and vinegar, and just enough sugar to stop your lips smarting.</p> \n<p>Earlier this week I simmered a ham in apple juice and served the amber broth with a dose of pickled cherries. The faintly salty cooking liquor and sour cherries were a perfect balance for the sweet, thick-cut meat and fat. An initial boiling in water prevented an over-salty broth. Skimming the surface regularly kept the juices clear and bright.</p> \n<p>The next day we ate the ham cold, cut thinner this time, with a spinach salad (dressing: cider vinegar, walnut oil, grain mustard, lemon juice) with more of the cherries and their juice. Afterwards, greedy for more of the pickled fruit, we ate thick yogurt sweetened with whipped cream, a pinch of sugar and the meanest seasoning of ground cinnamon. We then tipped a tiny spoonful of the cherries over the folds of creamy, spice-flecked yogurt.</p> \n<h2>Pickled cherries</h2> \n<p>I used dark, sweet dessert cherries for this. If you are using sour fruit, then add a little more sugar. Makes 500g of pickled cherries.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>cherries </strong>500g<strong> </strong><br /><strong>red-wine vinegar </strong>125ml<br /><strong>red wine</strong> 375ml<br /><strong>sugar </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>black peppercorns </strong>1 tsp<br /><strong>star anise </strong>2 whole<strong> </strong><br /></p> \n<p>Pull the cherries from their stalks, then halve each fruit and remove the stones. Put the stoned cherries into a stainless-steel or enamelled saucepan then pour in the vinegar and red wine and bring to the boil. Stir in the sugar, the peppercorns and the star anise then lower the heat so the liquid bubbles gently for 3 or 4 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and leave the mixture to cool.</p> \n<h2>Grilled mackerel, pickled cherries and samphire</h2> \n<p>The sour pickling juice of the cherries does the work of lemon juice here, balancing the oily richness of the fish. A few spoonfuls over the hot fish are as important as the cherries themselves.</p> \n<p>Serves 2<br /><strong>mackerel fillets </strong>4<br /><strong>olive oil </strong>2 tbsp<br /><strong>samphire </strong>2 handfuls<br /><strong>pickled cherries </strong>6 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>Check the mackerel fillets for any stray bones, then place them skin-side down on a lined grill pan. Brush them lightly with olive oil, then season with a little salt. Cook under an overhead grill or over the bars of a hot grill for four minutes on each side until lightly cooked through. (The advantage of cooking over a grill is that you will have crisp skin, too, but an overhead grill works well enough.)</p> \n<p>Rinse the samphire in cold running water and trim any tough roots. Put the samphire in a bowl and add the cherries and their juices. Toss the cherries and samphire and leave for a few minutes while the mackerel cooks. Place a bed of samphire and cherries on two plates, spoon over the cherry pickling liquor, then place a couple of fillets on each. Spoon over a little more pickling liquor.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8dcc71522b93afbfb41333d5575e4833d8d7d40b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435661454346/430168d5-e760-48e1-bd70-2e071f686d58-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Nigel Slater's gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe on a round plate \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In the pink: Nigel Slater’s gammon with apple juice and pickled cherries recipe.

Pour in the litre of water and the apple juice, then tuck in the bay leaves. Add the peppercorns and cloves and bring to the boil. If any froth comes to the surface, remove it with a draining spoon. When every bit of froth has been removed and the liquid is clear, lower the heat so it bubbles gently, then partially cover with a lid.</p> \n<p>Let the gammon cook for about 60-90 minutes, checking the liquid level from time to time and turning the meat carefully once or twice to ensure even cooking. Switch off the heat but leave the meat in the cooking liquor.</p> \n<p>Lift the meat out and place it on a carving board. Taste the cooking liquid, correct the seasoning if necessary. Carve the meat into thick slices and put two or three per person into shallow dishes or deep plates.

If the question draws a blank, it’s a dead giveaway as to a person’s age, while the question itself often reveals much about someone’s interests and passions.</p> \n<p>For example, “Where were you when you had your first tomato moment?” “My <em>what</em> moment?” would be most people’s reply to that, but some obsessives will have a shortlist of their top five tomato moments, all waiting to be shared. They’re also likely to have a shot of some mixed chopped tomatoes as their phone screensaver (or is that just me?), or to entice us to open an Instagram image by giving it the tagline “Hello, sexy” – only to reveal a single heirloom tomato in <a href=\"https://instagram.com/p/3v3bOWsSWy/\">its full, naked, perfect glory</a>.</p> \n<p>I’ve had many such moments of my own: sublimely sweet cherry tomatoes, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/04/dakos-onepot-chicken-recipes-ottolenghi\">chopped and piled high on dakos biscuits</a>, the Cretan barley rusk for which I fell so heavily a year or two back; a spectacular tomato and pomegranate salad at <a href=\"http://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/istanbul/restaurants/fast-food/hamdi-restaurant\">Hamdi</a>, a kebab restaurant near Istanbul’s spice bazaar. My most memorable moment, however, came while hiking in the Italian coastal region of Liguria a few years ago. In the village of Manarola, we came across a patch of tomato vines heavy with intensely ripe, wonkily shaped, unevenly red and perfectly warmed fruit: the temptation to reach out was just too great, and the taste was unimprovable.</p> \n<p>These holiday experiences can be hard to replicate at home. Meals are savoured, phones get forgotten for large chunks of the day, actual conversation takes place, books get read. The holiday over, depsite all our good intentions to build these life-affirming habits back into our day-to-day lives, it’s all too easy to revert back to the habitual phone-checking, the box set and the meals eaten on the run.</p> \n<p>And so it is with tomatoes: the difference between those we’d happily feast on for breakfast, lunch and dinner while abroad, and what often passes for a tomato back home can be enormous. But if you shop wisely (and these days there’s a much bigger range on offer, in both local greengrocers and larger supermarkets), you can come pretty close to those holiday memories. Fill that basket with as many different varieties, sizes and colours as you can: orange Sungold cherry tomatoes, large ridged Brandywines, green, striped, you name it. When you get them home, keep that holiday sun in mind and don’t put them in the fridge: <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2002/jul/06/foodanddrink.shopping1\">this dulls their fragrance and flavour</a>. And if you can, put your tomatoes out in the sun for a few hours before turning them into a salad: it makes a remarkable difference to the taste.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato, rhubarb and elderflower salad</strong></h2> \n<p>This salad is all about the quality and range of the tomatoes involved, so make an effort to get hold of as many different kinds, colours and sizes as you can, making sure they are all good and ripe. Elderflower is still just in season, so if you have any nearby, do go out and pick some: it makes the finished dish look even more stunning. I’ve kept this dairy-free, but it also works very well with some soft goat’s cheese dotted on top. With thanks to Esme Robinson. Serves six to eight.</p> \n<p><strong>2 tbsp elderflower cordial</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>4 tsp cider vinegar</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp Dijon mustard</strong><br /><strong>1 garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>160g rhubarb (1-2 sticks; pink, ideally)</strong><br /><strong>1.4kg mixed tomatoes, large ones cut into 0.5cm rounds, medium ones into 0.5cm-wide wedges, cherries halved</strong><br /><strong>5g fresh oregano leaves</strong><br /><strong>1 handful fresh elderflowers (optional)</strong></p> \n<p>Put the first five ingredients in a bowl with a half-teaspoon of salt and whisk. Cut the rhubarb on an angle into 2mm-thick slices, add to the bowl and leave to marinate for 30 minutes. Arrange the tomatoes on a platter and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Spoon over the rhubarb and dressing, scatter the oregano on top, and finish with elderflowers, if using.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato salad with horseradish cream</strong></h2> \n<p>This has quite a lot of horseradish, which I find works really well with the cream and the acidity of the tomatoes. If you don’t like the intensity, just use less. Serves six as a side dish or first course.</p> \n<p><strong>30g finely grated fresh horseradish (or 40g shop-bought horseradish sauce)</strong><br /><strong>1 small garlic clove, peeled and crushed</strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tsp white-wine vinegar</strong><br /><strong>Coarse sea salt </strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>100ml double cream</strong><br /><strong>10g tarragon leaves, torn</strong><br /><strong>15g basil leaves, roughly shredded</strong><br /><strong>900g red tomatoes (a mixture of types and sizes, ideally), cut into 5mm-thick slices</strong></p> \n<p>In a medium bowl, whisk the horseradish with the garlic, vinegar, half a teaspoon of salt, a tablespoon of the oil and two tablespoons of cold water. Pour in the cream, whisking all the while, until you have a uniform, runny sauce (don’t over-whip: you don’t want the sauce to thicken), then stir through the tarragon and two-thirds of the basil.</p> \n<p>To serve, spread the horseradish cream on the bottom of six shallow bowls and top with the tomatoes, making sure to leave some of the cream visible underneath. Drizzle over the remaining oil, and add a sprinkle of basil and a pinch of salt.</p> \n<h2><strong>Chopped salad with tahini and za’atar</strong></h2> \n<p>The addition of tahini paste to a familiar tomato and cucumber salad is a revelation. Serves four.</p> \n<p><strong>6 ripe plum tomatoes, cut into 1cm dice</strong><br /><strong>2 mini-cucumbers, trimmed and cut into 1cm dice</strong><br /><strong>1 red pepper, seeds, stalk and pith removed, cut into 1cm dice</strong><br /><strong>5 spring onions, trimmed and thinly sliced on an angle</strong><br /><strong>15g coriander leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp lemon juice</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>200g feta, cut into 4 rectangular blocks (optional)</strong><br /><strong>4 tbsp tahini</strong><br /><strong>2 tsp za’atar</strong></p> \n<p>Put the chopped tomatoes in a sieve over a bowl for 20 minutes. Discard the resulting juice and put the tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper, spring onions and coriander in a large bowl. Add the lemon juice, oil and half a teaspoon of salt, and stir gently to combine.</p> \n<p>To serve, arrange the feta (if using) on four plates and spoon the salad on top, making sure some of the feta remains visible. Pour a spoonful of tahini over each portion and finish with a sprinkle of za’atar.</p> \n<h2><strong>Tomato and mozzarella salad with buckwheat and curry leaves</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-1deaa196-30b2-4fbd-a937-e59753801cd0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140471804/2d63c69c-f3e2-41ea-824f-6cdb83482c17-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi's tomato and mozzarella salad with buckwheat and curry leaves\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s tomato and mozzarella salad with buckwheat and curry leaves: a novel twist on the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil template.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian. Food styling: Maud Eden</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Buckwheat is one of my favourite ingredients: I love its earthy, slightly nutty and smoky notes, and the welcome crunch it lends to any dish. Just leave it out if it’s not to your taste: the dish works well without it. I have to thank my friend <a href=\"http://www.peter-gordon.net/\">Peter Gordon</a> for the unusual flavour combination here. Serves six, as a first course.</p> \n<p><strong>1 large banana shallot, peeled and cut into thin, 2mm-thick rounds </strong><br /><strong>1 tbsp Pedro Xim&eacute;nez (or other sweet sherry) vinegar</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>600g tomatoes (as wide a range as you can get – the more colours, shapes and sizes, the better)</strong><br /><strong>40 fresh curry leaves (ie, from about 3 stems) </strong><br /><strong>1&frac12; tsp black mustard seeds</strong><br /><strong>25g kasha (aka roasted buckwheat; optional)</strong><br /><strong>450g buffalo mozzarella, torn into six </strong></p> \n<p>Put the shallots in a large bowl with the vinegar, a tablespoon of oil and a quarter-teaspoon of salt, and set aside to steep for at least 30 minutes. Cut the larger tomatoes into 1cm wedges and smaller ones into halves or quarters – you’re aiming for tomato pieces of a roughly uniform size.</p> \n<p>Put a small saucepan on a medium heat and add the remaining oil. Once hot, tip in the curry leaves and mustard seeds, and fry for just a minute. Stir quickly, remove the pan from the heat and set aside to infuse and cool. Once cooled, pour the spiced oil over the onions, then mix into the tomatoes with another quarter-teaspoon of salt and half the kasha, if using.</p> \n<p>To serve, put a piece of mozzarella on each plate, spoon the tomato mixture on top and finish with the remaining kasha.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/24/1435140311122/Yotam-Ottolenghis-tomato--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yotam Ottolenghi's tomato, rhubarb and elderflower salad: It's all about the quality of the tomatoes.

Just another day at the office, then. My crime that day was to have said during an episode of <em>MasterChef</em> that a dessert “looked like the sort of thing served at a cheap wedding full of regret held at a hotel on a ring road”. My correspondent’s stepdaughter had apparently just got married at a ring road hotel and it had been lovely. “I’m sure it was,” I replied, “but was it also full of regret? Because if it wasn’t, it isn’t covered by my critique.” I may be a snob, but I’m a precise snob.</p> \n<p>The touchiness shouldn’t have surprised me. When it comes to food at weddings people are like that. A wedding is one of life’s great set piece events, upon which the compass flickers. Accordingly everything about them must be perfect, even when everything plainly isn’t. And now it’s June, and wedding season is upon us. For the next few months many of us will be putting on suits and frocks smelling of dry cleaning fluid, and tramping into baggy marquees where we will eat some of the worst, most overpriced food ever inflicted upon us by people who claim to be our dearest friends. And then, regardless of how dismal it all was, we will loudly proclaim the opposite. In the coming months more lies will be told about the quality of lunch and dinner than in the rest of the year put together.</p> \n<p>We are meant to be experiencing a British food revolution, and in many ways we are. There are better restaurants than ever before. But in the business of mass catering we are generally awful. I say generally. Obviously, if you run a catering firm and you’re limbering up to complain, I don’t mean you. You’re brilliant. Likewise, the food at your wedding was obviously fabulous. It’s everyone else.</p> \n<p>Everyone else is responsible for dry canap&eacute;s that taste only of margarine and complacency. Everyone else is responsible for desiccated lumps of yesterday’s pre-cooked chicken the colour of an old stained sink; for sauces that could creosote fences and vegetables so overboiled you could suck them through a straw; for cream desserts that have split, and overbaked tarts with pastry like walnut shells. And the cost! I only use exclamation marks for shouting, which is what I’m doing. THE COST! Despite economies of scale, caterers charge more for this dismal crud than the price of a quality restaurant meal and rising. Why are they allowed to get away with it?</p> \n<p>Precisely because it’s a special event, and nobody likes to admit one of those isn’t actually that special. Plus, avoiding the pitfalls of mass catering dreariness requires a certain radicalism: the willingness to do away with the awful formally plated main course, to sack the poor exploited teenage waitresses and instead concentrate spend on the cooking. The problem is that weddings generally involve young people and for all their youthful irreverence, young people can be rather “small c” conservative. A wedding is a grown-up event, and they have a mythologised notion of what grown-up looks like, which includes a marquee and chicken the colour of a stained sink.</p> \n<p>Recently the savings expert Martin Lewis’s <a href=\"http://www.moneysavingexpert.com/family/cheaper-weddings\">website </a>said that, when booking a wedding reception at a hotel, tell them it’s for a party rather than for nuptials. Apparently hotels charge more the moment they hear it’s a wedding. This is good advice.

The unbearably anally retentive! Please assemble in the e-meeting room that is theguardian.com. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How To Eat </a>– the blog series charged with identifying the ideal version of Britain’s favourite dishes – is back and, this month, we’re tackling that controversial classic, tuna salad. It is the star of a million at-desk lunches (so long as <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/politics/2012/nov/15/liz-kendall-tuna-salad-row\">no one nicks yours from the fridge</a>, that is), and the perfect quick fall-back meal on a hot summer’s evening, but it comes in 1,001 varieties and all but one of them is completely and utterly wrong. So, without further ado, lettuce commence. As ever, keep it cool BTL: no flakiness, no raw language, no overly salty exchanges. </p> \n<h2><strong>The tuna </strong></h2> \n<p>Way back in the mists of time (1998), when we were all obsessed with the perceived sexiness and health-giving properties of the Mediterranean diet, there might have been an excuse for using seared, thinly sliced tuna steak in a salad. We were young, we were foolish and this novelty wasn’t (from memory) &pound;30-a-kilo. But, in 2015, to do so would be a flagrant waste of that precious rosy flesh. Its delicate flavour is best savoured as a rare treat, rather than leaving it to jostle for attention in a salad of competing flavours. </p> \n<p>Instead, tinned tuna will do the job - which is not to say that all tinned tuna is created equal. There is a self-evident hierarchy of quality, both for the tuna itself (flaked useless, chunks marginally better, steaks best), and the liquid it is preserved in. Tuna in spring water or brine is dry, mealy, abominable stuff. Sunflower oil is better, but for maximum flavour it has to be in olive oil. </p> \n<p>I trust it goes without saying that you should <em>never</em> a) use smoked tuna, b) mix tuna with mayo if it is going in a salad, or c) resort to any of the infused or pre-mixed tunas that (in a damning indictment of late capitalism) proliferate in our supermarkets. A salad is no place – if, indeed, one exists – to be experimenting with tuna dressed with tomato and herbs or infused with soy and ginger. </p> \n<h2><strong>Leaves</strong></h2> \n<p>Let he who has never bought a supermarket bagged salad cast the first stone, but you cannot dispute that these sad sacks are a rip-off, and that they are a particular waste of money when it comes to tuna salad. All you want and need, here, is some clean, sweet base crunch. Cos or baby gem lettuce are the way to go; shredded or chopped in chunky hunks that are neither too small nor so big that you need to unhinge your jaw to eat them. Save your swankier salad leaves – peppery watercress, bitter radicchio, that homegrown crop of woody, horrible rocket that never seems to end – for salads where they will make a genuinely effective contribution. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anchovies\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Twort/Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2><strong>The salad ingredients</strong></h2> \n<p>Were this a band, you now have your star lead singer (the tuna) and your tight rhythm section (the leaves) in place. It is time to add some mid-range colour: a lead guitarist, a keyboard player, backing singers, perhaps a flautist for that unexpected prog-rock interlude. Now, some of you will read the ingredients listed below and think: “Hang on, this is just a bastardised salad ni&ccedil;oise”, but what of it? The not-quite-salad-ni&ccedil;oise is – to extend this rock group metaphor way past its breaking point – like a band’s classic first album. Later, they will dabble in jazz-funk and start naming their tracks with runic symbols. Which will be interesting. In a way. But that first album, <em>Not Quite Salad Ni&ccedil;oise</em>, is the one you will always come back to.</p> \n<p>Why? Because, primarily, a great tuna salad is a fine balancing act between sharp, salty, fishy flavours and those fresher, spritzier vegetable components – which function almost as an ongoing palate cleanser, as you eat. And, while there is no need to stick faithfully to the original, the salad ni&ccedil;oise remains our most reliable outline guide as regards how to achieve that balance. Moreover, it determines the additional ingredients you might use in an eminently sensible way.</p> \n<p>The full list of acceptable/unacceptable ingredients is as follows:</p> \n<p><strong>YES</strong>: slices of waxy/new potatoes (boiled); anchovies (chopped for thorough distribution, never whole); halved, not overly ripe baby plum tomatoes; cucumber, deseeded and sliced; a small amount of finely chopped sweet red or spring onion; capers; jarred, brined green olives (save those fresh, buttery nocellera to enjoy on their own); chopped or sliced boiled egg; it’s creaminess is a fantastic contrast. A handful of finely chopped leafy, green herbs (parsley, chives, chervil, basil even) is also welcome, but not essential.</p> \n<p><strong>NO</strong>: French/green beans (vile cold, and invariably boiled to a mushy consistency); raw white onion; carrot and beetroot (whose flavours are jarring in this context); croutons (this is not a caesar salad); any chilli or feta stuffed olives (it pains me that this needs pointing out); dull black and/or shrunken purple kalamata-like olives; sliced bell pepper (whose presence in <em>any salad</em> should rightly prompt a lengthy outburst of vociferous “industrial” language). </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/3b4da5a26b7c4daf358669726d8688eaf69349b0/0_65_5760_3460/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Not quite right\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Not quite right: carrots, feta and dull black olives should be avoided.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Also, on the egg-front, please note that no one wants a tepid-to-warm, still runny poached egg on their tuna salad. There is something deeply unappetising about rogue “hot” ingredients in cold salads and/or salad leaves covered in stringy trails of translucent albumen. Moreover, that running yolk turns any tuna present into gluey, indigestible lumps. You may think a soft poached egg on a tuna salad is sophisticated, clever even. It isn’t.</p> \n<h2><strong>Dressing</strong></h2> \n<p>Step away from the pesto (it makes everything taste of, well, pesto), and dispense with that sharp-elbowed white wine vinegar. All you need here is olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and dijon mustard, all smoothly emulsified in such a way that the character of each ingredient is clear, but elegantly reconciled. Whisk, taste, go.</p> \n<h2><strong>Assembly and plating </strong></h2> \n<p>Serving a salad in a deep cereal bowl makes it difficult to eat. Serving it on a plate always looks wrong. Serving it on slate, meanwhile, is a clear sign that chef needs to stop browsing inspirational tableware catalogues and actually think, practically, about how people eat.</p> \n<p>Instead, line a shallow, wide-rimmed bowl with leaves, and separately (you want those leaves to retain their distinct flavour and crunch) dress and mix the other ingredients, minus the tuna. That, similarly, should be broken into substantive chunks on top and left as a separate complementary dimension of flavour, not doused in vinaigrette.</p> \n<h2><strong>When</strong></h2> \n<p>Lunch or tea – also known, in some part of the UK, as dinner. NB. If anyone in your circle every refers to tuna salad as a “light mid-week supper” you can – after your toes have uncurled from that sudden, excruciating cramp – happily kill them in any gruesome manner you think fitting. There is not a court in the land that would convict you.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink</strong></h2> \n<p>Crisply bitter pale ales; dry, flinty white wines; water. </p> \n<p>So, tuna salad – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f6b5fd3d82e4a524640762ffe657f01f71e4e100/0_594_7210_4326/7210.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":4326,"width":7210,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"Tuna Salad","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d11b5a5adbd0f667949f2d162af80f0347d0354a/0_425_1148_689/1148.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":689,"width":1148,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Anchovies can be a useful addition, as long as they are chopped for thorough distribution.

Melt the butter over a low heat. Stir the icing sugar and water together until a thick paste forms, then add the honey, vanilla extract and salt. Whisk in the melted butter until smooth. Set aside in a large bowl (one wide enough to dunk the doughnuts in later).</p> \n<p>2 Pour the cooking oil into a large pan (not nonstick) to a depth of at least 9cm. Do not to overfill the pan. Heat the oil until it’s 180C/350F; use a sugar thermometer to monitor the temperature. Don’t leave the oil unattended while it’s heating. Once it’s up to temperature, turn the heat right down, or even off, to prevent it from smoking.</p> \n<p>3 While the oil heats, prepare the dough. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, salt and nutmeg in a large mixing bowl. Whisk the egg, buttermilk and vanilla together in a separate bowl before adding this mixture to the dry ingredients. Stir together to get a sticky, malleable dough.</p> \n<p>4 Dust a work surface with plenty of flour, then empty the dough on to it. Pat the dough out to a thickness of roughly 1cm (you can use a rolling pin if you want, but I find it easier just to use my hands here), flouring it as you go to minimise sticking. Cut out 8cm circles using a pastry cutter, then use a smaller 3-4cm cutter or appropriately sized lid to stamp out the small holes in the middle of each doughnut. It’s up to you whether you gather up these doughnut holes to make more doughnuts or just fry them as they are.</p> \n<p>5 Fry the doughnuts in batches of 3 or 4, cooking them for 1 &frac12; minutes on each side. Once cooked, pat dry on a piece of kitchen towel to soak up any excess oil, then, while they’re still warm, dip them in the glaze, coating one or both sides. Leave to cool and set on a wire rack, then repeat the frying and glazing with the remaining doughnuts. These are at their best when they’re freshly cooked, but you can revive them the next day (if they last that long) by warming them in the microwave or a low oven.</p> \n<h2><strong>Blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns</strong></h2> \n<p>Chelsea buns, sticky cinnamon swirls, dough wrapped in toasted pecans and chocolate chips … sweet buns are as good as baking gets, but they’re not ideal if you’ve got an impatient sweet tooth. Too often the thought of a lengthy knead and slow prove sends me careering towards the biscuit tin instead in my laziness. This is a recipe that sidesteps all that hassle, using a quick buttermilk dough instead of the usual bread sort, so you can have these ready, from storecupboard to table, in under an hour. They’re great for breakfasts because they’re not too sweet, but just as good as an afternoon snack.<br /></p> \n<p><strong>Makes 12</strong><br />300g plain flour <br />75g wholemeal flour<br />125g caster sugar<br />1&frac12; tsp baking powder<br />1 tsp bicarbonate of soda<br />1 tsp ground cinnamon<br />&frac14; tsp salt<br />50g poppy seeds<br />Zest of 2 lemons<br />300ml buttermilk<br />400g blueberries<br />150g icing sugar<br />Lemon juice</p> \n<p><br />1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a 20x30cm roasting dish or baking tin with baking parchment.</p> \n<p>2 Stir the flours, 100g of the caster sugar, baking powder, bicarbonate of soda, cinnamon and salt together in a large bowl. Mix in the poppy seeds and lemon zest. Pour in the buttermilk and work the ingredients together using a wooden spoon until a rough, slightly sticky dough forms. If the mixture feels very floury or crumbly, add a drop of milk.</p> \n<p>3 Dust the work surface with flour and roll the dough out to a rectangle roughly 50x30cm, flouring the rolling pin as you go. Scatter the blueberries all over the surface of the rectangle and pat them gently into the soft dough. Dust over the remaining 25g of caster sugar.</p> \n<p>4 Roll the rectangle up from long edge to long edge to give a roll roughly 50cm long, pinching the dough a little as you reach the end to help it stay securely rolled. Trim off the ends, then cut into 12 equal slices. Arrange these rolls in the prepared dish, spacing them equally and leaving a couple of centimetres between each to allow them room to rise.</p> \n<p>5 Bake for 25-30 minutes, until they’re fat, firm to the touch and mottled with juice from the blueberries. Meanwhile, prepare the glaze: stir the icing sugar together with enough lemon juice to give a thick, but pourable icing.</p> \n<p>6 Once the buns are cooked and still hot from the oven, brush them liberally with the lemon glaze and leave to cool a while in their tin. These are at their best when still slightly warm. <br /></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"What is the most underused ingredient in British baking?\"> \n <iframe src=\"https://guardiannewsampampmedia.formstack.com/forms/untitled_form_19_copy_12_copy_21\" title=\"COOK July 4 Ruby Bakes\" width=\"100%\" height=\"500\"></iframe> \n</figure>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435832402955/a81f43f5-3fdd-4674-8ecd-2bae300eefbf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"Blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns (left) and sticky doughnuts.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-04T05:00:07Z","lastModified":"2015-07-04T05:00:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":46,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/buttermilk-recipes-doughnuts-blueberry-soda-bread-buns","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aazj","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/buttermilk-recipes-doughnuts-blueberry-soda-bread-buns","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/02/buttermilk-recipes-doughnuts-blueberry-soda-bread-buns"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435832402955/a81f43f5-3fdd-4674-8ecd-2bae300eefbf-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Buttermilk provides a quick rise and moist texture to these blueberry buttermilk soda bread buns (left) and sticky doughnuts.
