Chucking a load of ingredients into the pan and hoping for the best doesn’t really wash here, however hard you scrub.</p> \n<p>Softer and crumblier than toffee, smoother and richer than its close relative, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/jan/22/how-to-make-perfect-tablet-recipe\">tablet</a>, its dairy content means fudge is associated particularly with the south-west, though shops churning it out in a mind-boggling array of weird and only occasionally wonderful flavours are de rigueur in tourist honeypots throughout the British Isles.

If you want to keep things simple, like candy <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">pros Mrs Hope and Mr Greenwood</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.hopeandgreenwood.co.uk/recipes/peanut-butter-fudge\">folk from Rodda’s clotted cream</a> and <a href=\"http://www.greatbritishchefs.com/recipes/caramel-mousse-recipe\">Michelin-star chef Tom Aikens</a>, this can be caster or ordinary white granulated, but given sugar plays such a large part, the demerara suggested by the <a href=\"https://www.carnation.co.uk/recipes/67/Ultimate-Fudge\">Carnation condensed milk tin</a> or the light muscovado used by <a href=\"http://www.jamieoliver.com/news-and-features/features/creamy-sea-salted-fudge-recipe/#ftsTEEwRpKOcplKw.97\">Ren Behan in Jamie magazine</a> will give a more interesting flavour. Personally, I prefer the slightly more subtle caramel notes of the first here.</p> \n<p>Aikens and Roddas both also add some sugar syrup – boring glucose in the former case, ambrosial golden in the latter – which makes their fudge wonderfully smooth as opposed to the slightly gritty, sandy texture of the Carnation and Hope and Greenwood recipes, which, though undoubtedly pleasing, is more reminiscent of Scottish tablet. Clearly feeling two types of sugar aren’t quite enough, Aikens finishes his fudge with an infinitesimal amount of icing sugar, for, no doubt, very sound Michelin-starred reasons which I am unable to fathom.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15f50824423376fe7324855e6d5deb45f925ddde\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945143833/02911193-5340-4c62-9f42-70adb1e18073-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Roddas's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Roddas’s fudge goes all out with clotted cream.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The dairy</h2> \n<p>The second, and most important, ingredient in fudge is fat. Dairy fat to be precise. Some recipes cleverly combine the two ingredients in one big hit of nauseatingly delicious condensed milk, which makes their fudge taste distinctly like white chocolate – not that there’s anything wrong with this, but it’s not the classic flavour I’m after.</p> \n<p>Hope and Greenwood plump for the nostalgic boiled flavour of evaporated milk instead, an ingredient that has so far failed to reinvent itself for a more decadent age. Despite a weird complaint that it tastes “meaty”, I happen to like it, but not as much as the clotted cream which plays an unsurprisingly large part in the Roddas recipe, or the double variety in Aikens’s fudge.</p> \n<p>In fact, the Roddas recipe proves pretty popular; soft, smooth and rich, it’s classic Cornish seaside stuff. My only complaint is that the flavour is a little too sweet and rich, which I admit may sound ridiculous, but in a side-by-side comparison, we preferred those recipes using butter as well. Let’s be honest, everything’s better with butter. But, as butter and clotted cream could prove a fatal combination, a downgrade to double seems just what the doctor ordered.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb2e571089756166bf95884fb673baae2a7c905b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945257884/e7b22b5b-562c-436a-b61f-86987205051f-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Ren Behan's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ren Behan’s recipes uses vanilla extract.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The flavouring</h2> \n<p>Though to make this a fair test I omit Hope and Greenwood’s peanut butter (anything containing peanut butter is always going to win big for me), I do allow Roddas, Behan and Aikens their vanilla. Not strictly necessary for a satisfactory result, but a lovely combination of flavours nevertheless – and this is one place where I think vanilla extract works better than those fiddly little seeds. Salt is another must – as ever, it brings out the best in the sugar, keeping it just the right side of sickly. How much you add depends on how enthusiastically you have embraced salted caramel mania over the last few years; sceptics will be content with a pinch, salt fiends like myself should up the dosage considerably. In for a penny, in for a pound.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"28087b3b2da0edb1419a066bbbc37cab6d8e9da5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945369181/d110d9e0-c45d-47e4-9883-ecdc4f5be5c9-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Tom Aikens fudge.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Aikens uses a high temperature to produce a more brittle fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>The method</h2> \n<p>All the recipes I try start in much the same way, dissolving the sugar and dairy together over heat, bringing the resulting mixture to the boil, and then letting it simmer until it reaches the desired setting temperature. (Covering the pan, as Roddas suggest, works fine, but feels a bit scary to me; I prefer to keep my molten sugar where I can see it.)</p> \n<p>The difference comes in temperature, which ranges from 113C from Behan, which gives a very soft, almost fondant-like result, to Aikens’s 121C, which is brittle and chewy, more like a hard caramel than a fudge. Even Hope and Greenwood and Carnation’s 118C is a bit harder than I had expect from a fudge – my testers and I agree that Roddas have hit the sweet spot at 116C: firm enough to hold its shape, soft enough to melt in the mouth.</p> \n<p>Lots of recipes give advice about how to achieve this without a sugar thermometer (dropping a little into a glass of cold water until it reaches a pliable consistency), but this is a fiddly and inexact science, so I’d recommend investing in a sugar thermometer. They’re not expensive, and they’ll work forever (though be careful when washing as they can be delicate).</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff868836c9b6e7193c7f55d0a3b6ca6c64059f29\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/10/1433945538506/71cf141a-be66-4573-94d9-0c1097f9e045-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Hope &amp; Greenwood's fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hope &amp; Greenwood’s fudge has a slightly gritty texture.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Stirring?</h2> \n<p>Fudge, like tablet, is beaten as it cools to help it thicken. Behan suggests allowing it to cool a little before doing this, but I can’t see that it makes much difference, apart from making it dangerously tempting to sample (still not a good idea, however tough you think your tongue is). Once it’s set completely, however, it’s every man for himself. I cannot be held responsible for the consequences. Add chopped nuts, dried fruit, crisp nuggets of streaky bacon … your call.</p> \n<h2>The perfect fudge</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b1ffc0ad8082f6feb097654dd62cb6a614aaf625\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/11/1434004392334/11b8acb2-0705-4248-a43a-41958b7cd118-460x318.jpeg\" alt=\"Felicity Cloake's perfect fudge\" width=\"460\" height=\"318\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Felicity Cloake’s perfect fudge.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity Cloake/Felicity Cloake for the Guardian</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><em>(makes 1 x 23x23cm tin)</em></p> \n<p>100g butter<br />550g demerara sugar<br />200g golden syrup<br />350ml double cream<br />1 tsp vanilla extract<br />&frac14;-&frac12; tsp sea salt flakes</p> \n<p>Melt the butter, sugar and syrup and cream in a medium, high-sided heavy-based pan, stirring until the sugar has dissolved.

A frozen cheese and herb ice for a hot summer’s day, not to stuff into a cornet, but to spread on toast, to eat with slices of air-dried ham, or to sit at the side of a tomato and basil salad.</p> \n<p>I wanted to sweeten the ice, partly as this helps to improve the texture. Sugar seemed inappropriate. Honey, on the other hand, stood out as a natural candidate. A trickle of liquid honey makes a fine addition to a soft, bloomy goat’s cheese – particularly those with a hint of thyme or rosemary to them. So honey it was, a little being first warmed with thyme leaves then folded into the goat’s yogurt with the crumbled cheese. I could, to be honest, have added more, but the plan was always to use the ice cream to spread on bread and eat with a slice of ham, so I used just enough to balance the sourness and to give a backnote of honey. No machine necessary for this, by the way.</p> \n<p>Talking of sourness, rhubarb is abundant in the shops at the moment, and deserves a life beyond crumble. I use it mostly in conjunction with custard, either as stewed fruit, in a trifle or a posset, or in a tart filled with pastry cream. Today it was rhubarb and custard’s turn in the ice-cream machine. The point of rhubarb, at least for me, is its bracing sourness, and that can be lost among the sugar and cream of an ice. I got round this by reserving some of the juice, and pouring it over the ice cream as we ate.</p> \n<h2>Rhubarb ice cream</h2> \n<p>Serves 6<br />For the custard:<br /><strong>single cream</strong> 500ml<br /><strong>vanilla extract</strong> 1 tsp<br /><strong>egg </strong>5 yolks<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 4 tbsp<br /></p> \n<p>For the rhubarb:<br /><strong>rhubarb</strong> 600g<br /><strong>caster sugar</strong> 75g<br /><strong>water</strong> 100ml</p> \n<p>Make the custard first. Pour the cream into a medium-sized nonstick saucepan, then add the vanilla extract and bring to the boil. Beat the egg yolks and sugar until thick and creamy, then pour over the hot milk and stir to mix. Wipe the saucepan clean, place it over a low to moderate heat and pour in the sugar, egg and cream mixture. Stir gently with a wooden spoon, letting the mixture heat through, but stay just short of coming to a boil. (If it boils, the custard will curdle.) As the mixture thickens, stir almost continuously until it is thick enough to coat the back of the spoon.</p> \n<p>Reduce the temperature of the custard quickly, by pouring it into a chilled bowl, beating quickly to let the steam escape. Leave the custard to cool, then chill it in the fridge.</p> \n<p>To cook the rhubarb, cut it into short lengths (about the size of a wine cork), then pack them into a medium-sized saucepan. Scatter over the caster sugar, pour in the water and bring it to the boil. Lower the heat, partially cover the pan with a lid, then leave the rhubarb to simmer for 5 to 10 minutes until it is tender and soft.</p> \n<p>Pour the rhubarb syrup from the pan into a bowl or jug and set it aside. Process the rhubarb to a thick pur&eacute;e – either in a food processor or a blender. Chill the juice and the pur&eacute;e.</p> \n<p>Stir the chilled custard and pur&eacute;e together, pour it into the bowl of an ice-cream machine and leave to churn. If you are not using a machine, then pour the mixture into a chilled freezer box and freeze for a couple of hours. Stir the frozen edges into the liquid middle and return to the freezer every hour. It should take about 4 hours to freeze.</p> \n<p>To serve, place spoonfuls or balls of ice cream into bowls then spoon over the chilled rhubarb syrup.</p> \n<h2>Goat’s cheese ice cream</h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a255f57592ae8d5b0cb025f5f1db78590ca25676\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/3/1433323745411/2a3ff5f3-3ba0-4f25-9c1b-e4c65a8c174c-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chilled out: goat’s cheese ice cream with air-dried ham.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chilled out: goat’s cheese ice cream with air-dried ham.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Lovekin/Observer</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>This ice is made especially to be eaten with thin slices of charcuterie.

It will keep in the freezer for a day or two.</p> \n<p>Take it out 20 minutes or so before you intend to serve it and transfer to the fridge.</p> \n<p>To serve, divide the ice cream between four small bowls and serve with the slices of ham and some toasted bread.</p> \n<p><em>Email Nigel at <a href=\"mailto:nigel.slater@observer.co.uk\">nigel.slater@observer.co.uk</a></em></p> \n<p><em>Follow Nigel on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nigelslater\">@NigelSlater</a></em></p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/2/1433245307016/A-scoop-of-rhubarb-ice-cr-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"'Rhubarb deserves a life beyond crumble.

Instead, focus on the benefits of all your hard work</p>","byline":"Yotam Ottolenghi","body":"<p>Artichokes are, for some, as unapproachable as a&nbsp;patch of thistles. The fact that they actually are a thistle and look rather like a&nbsp;hand grenade just adds to the general sense of unease. The thing that really puts people off, though, is all the preparation required before you&nbsp;can get at the fleshy heart. &nbsp;</p> \n<p>Is it all worth it? Absolutely!. Plus, the artichoke challenge is one that can be met in a&nbsp;variety of ways. The first is simply to roll up your sleeves and get on with it. I don’t think I’ve ever been more awed by culinary dexterity than when I first came across Istanbul’s vegetable stallholders preparing huge artichokes. No chopping board, no veg peeler, just a small knife in one hand and the artichoke in the other. This they turned rapidly through 360 degrees while their little knife went chop, chop, chop, trim, trim, trim. It was all over in seconds, then they moved on to the next one.</p> \n<p>The second option is to take delight in the amount of prep involved and to look on it as A Good Thing. Jane Grigson, in her great <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/jane-grigson-s-vegetable-book.html\" title=\"\">Vegetable Book</a>, pretty much equates it to staving off anarchy in the civilised kitchen. “Above all,” she writes, “the artichoke is the vegetable expression of civilised living, of the long view, of increasing delight by anticipation and crescendo… It has no place in the troll’s world of instant gratification.”</p> \n<p>The third option, and perhaps the most traditional in the UK at least, is&nbsp;to make a meal out of getting to the heart. Boil the artichoke and serve with melted butter, mayonnaise or vinaigrette, for dipping the leaves into: with every leaf that hits the debris bowl, the closer you’re getting to the heart. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<p>The fourth option – and one that I&nbsp;hope would not make Grigson regard&nbsp;me as a troll – is to buy a&nbsp;pack of frozen artichoke hearts: for stuffing and braising, for instance, there’s a lot to recommend them (time-saving and callus-prevention being just two).</p> \n<p>The fifth and final option is to avoid&nbsp;the choke altogether and look&nbsp;out for purple-tipped baby artichokes. These little bouquets are&nbsp;so fresh, small and young that they haven’t yet developed a&nbsp;choke,&nbsp;so can be eaten almost in their entirety. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> \n<h2><strong>Baked baby artichokes with fennel and lemon</strong></h2> \n<p>There’s a bitterness in this that works so well with the creamy rich sauce. Serves four, as a starter.</p> \n<p><strong>2 large fennel bulbs, trimmed and cut lengthways into 2mm-thick slices – ideally, use a mandolin</strong><br /><strong>4 bay leaves</strong><br /><strong>&frac14; tsp black peppercorns</strong><br /><strong>3 tbsp olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>8 whole baby artichokes, stems trimmed to 2cm long</strong><br /><strong>100ml dry white wine</strong><br /><strong>2 tbsp lemon juice</strong><br /><strong>15g tarragon leaves, roughly chopped</strong><br /><strong>100g creme fraiche</strong><br /><strong>20g mayonnaise</strong></p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Put the fennel, bay, peppercorns, oil and half a teaspoon of salt in a medium, high-sided baking tray (about 25cm x 28cm), and stir to combine. Lay in the artichokes on their sides, slightly embedded in the fennel mix.</p> \n<p>Combine the wine with 100ml water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Pour over the artichokes, cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes, turning the artichokes halfway through. Remove the foil and bake for 10 minutes more, until the fennel has started to colour and any remaining liquid has evaporated. Lift the artichokes from the tray, then stir the lemon juice and tarragon through the fennel mix.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, in a small bowl, whisk together the creme fraiche and mayonnaise, and set aside.</p> \n<p>To serve, divide the warm fennel between four plates and top each portion with two warm artichokes. Spoon some of the creme fraiche mix on the side and serve.</p> \n<h2><strong>Artichoke, pea and bread salad</strong></h2> \n<p>This is best eaten the moment it’s ready, while the bread is still crisp and warm. Serves six.</p> \n<p><strong>2 lemons, halved, plus 4 tbsp lemon&nbsp;juice</strong><br /><strong>6 extra-large globe artichokes (about&nbsp;2.4kg in total) </strong><br /><strong>1 tsp urfa chilli flakes (or &frac12; tsp regular chilli flakes)</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp paprika</strong><br /><strong>90ml olive oil</strong><br /><strong>Salt</strong><br /><strong>120g crust-free ciabatta, broken into 2cm chunks</strong><br /><strong>100ml dry white wine</strong><br /><strong>5 sprigs fresh thyme</strong><br /><strong>3 bay leaves</strong><br /><strong>150g fresh podded peas (or frozen peas, defrosted)</strong><br /><strong>15g picked flat-leaf parsley, finely&nbsp;chopped</strong><br /><strong>1 tsp fennel seeds, toasted and roughly&nbsp;crushed</strong><br /><strong>50g pea shoots</strong></p> \n<p>Fill a large bowl with cold water, squeeze in the juice of the two lemons, then chuck the squeezed skins in the bowl, too. Clean and prepare the artichokes as in the next recipe, rubbing the cut surfaces with lemon juice as you go. Remove the tough outer leaves and all but 1cm of the stem. Use a small, sharp knife to trim around the base of the artichoke hearts, until the soft, white flesh is exposed, then add to the lemon water.</p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 160C/320F/gas mark 2&frac12;. In a medium bowl, mix together the chilli, paprika, two tablespoons of oil, a tablespoon of water and a quarter-teaspoon of salt. Add the bread, toss to coat and spread out on a baking tray. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until crisp, then remove and set aside.</p> \n<p>Put two and a half tablespoons of lemon juice in a large saute pan for which you have a lid, add the wine, two tablespoons of oil, the thyme, bay, half a teaspoon of salt and 50ml&nbsp;water. Cut the artichokes vertically into 1.5cm slices and add&nbsp;to the pan. Bring to a boil, turn the heat to low, cover the surface with a round piece of parchment paper, pop on the pan lid and leave to simmer for 15 minutes, stirring a couple of times, until the artichokes are soft. Remove from the heat, strain the juices into a&nbsp;saucepan (discard the aromatics) and put the cooked artichokes in a&nbsp;large bowl. Bring the liquor back to&nbsp;a boil and cook on a medium-high&nbsp;heat for five minutes, until it has reduced down to just two tablespoons of liquid. Remove from the heat, set aside for five minutes, then whisk in two tablespoons of oil and pour over the&nbsp;artichokes.</p> \n<p>Add the peas, parsley, fennel seeds, warm bread, half a&nbsp;tablespoon of lemon juice and a quarter-teaspoon of salt to the artichoke bowl. Stir gently to combine, then mix through the pea shoots and serve immediately.</p> \n<h2><strong>Stuffed Sicilian artichokes</strong></h2> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76ea52bc819c95a59eb0f7903304192aefb6714b\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/26/1432644388619/648d88a0-95d9-4850-84ca-85b2c0a42351-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Yotam Ottolenghi’s stuffed Sicilian artichokes: ‘The stuffing is wonderfully moist.’\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yotam Ottolenghi’s stuffed Sicilian artichokes: ‘The stuffing is wonderfully moist.’</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johanna Parkin for the Guardian.

Serves four, as a starter.&nbsp;</p> \n<p><strong>100g ciabatta, crusts cut off, then blitzed into large crumbs</strong><br /><strong>20g finely grated parmesan</strong><br /><strong>3 tinned anchovy fillets, drained and finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon, plus 2&nbsp;tbsp juice and 1 lemon, cut in half</strong><br /><strong>40g picked flat-leaf parsley leaves, finely chopped</strong><br /><strong>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</strong><br /><strong>90ml olive oil</strong><br /><strong>4 extra-large globe artichokes, each&nbsp;weighing about 400g</strong></p> \n<p>Put the breadcrumbs, parmesan, anchovies, lemon zest and parsley in a large bowl with an eighth of a&nbsp;teaspoon of salt and a good grind of pepper. Mix well and set aside.</p> \n<p>Whisk the oil, lemon juice and half a teaspoon of salt in a small bowl, and set aside.</p> \n<p>Use a large serrated knife to trim 2-3cm off the top of each artichoke, and rub the cut surface with a lemon half, to prevent discoloration. Take a small paring knife and “drill” a&nbsp;4cm-diameter hole in the centre of each artichoke, so you can remove the soft central leaves and expose the hairy choke. Scoop this out with a spoon, and rub all the&nbsp;cut surfaces with more lemon.</p> \n<p>Cut off the artichokes’ stems, so&nbsp;they can sit flat in a high-sided 27cm x 32cm baking tray (if they’re not too woody, you can add the stems to the tray, too). Use scissors to trim off the tough outer leaves, then use your hands to open out each artichoke like a flower.</p> \n<p>Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Pour the oil and lemon juice mix over the artichokes, so it dribbles down between the leaves as well as over the centre. Pack each artichoke with the stuffing, pressing it down into them, then pour water into the tray so it comes 0.5cm up the sides of the artichokes (you’ll need about 400ml in all). Cover tightly with foil and bake for 50 minutes; top up with water if the tray gets dry. Remove the foil and bake for 10 minutes more, until the top of the stuffing is crisp and golden. Remove, leave to cool for five minutes and serve.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of <a href=\"http://www.ottolenghi.co.uk\" title=\"\">Ottolenghi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nopi-restaurant.com\" title=\"\">Nopi</a> in London.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/About/General/2015/5/26/1432644072117/Yotam-Ottolenghis-baked-b-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yotam Ottolenghi's baked baby artichokes with fennel and lemon: 'The bitterness works well with the creamy, rich sauce.'

The winner: a<a href=\"http://www.steenbergs.co.uk/blog/2015/04/40-years-on-the-shelf-the-winner-of-our-oldestspice-competition-was-pickling-spice-from-1975/\"> pot of Sainsbury’s pickling spices bought in 1975 for 19p</a>. Clearly we should celebrate such Olympic standard procrastination. I’m sure they were planning to get round to their brilliant home-pickling project, just as soon as they had rearranged the cutlery drawer. But for me that response was overlaid by something else: recognition.</p> \n<p>For, purely by coincidence, while Steenbergs was encouraging the nation to excavate their kitchen cabinets, we were also giving our own walk-in larder a clean out. I say “we”. It was entirely my wife’s doing. I was minded to let sleeping condiments lie. Two of my unbending rules for a happy life: never look under a teenager’s bed and never, ever mess with the kitchen cupboards.</p> \n<p>But she was determined. And so the great work began. I stood by and watched as the kitchen surfaces were quickly covered with a Manhattan of bottles and jars of ancient vintage. This brought me face to face with all my unrealised ambitions as a domestic cook. My desire to be an endlessly inventive kitchen warrior with a seemingly boundless repertoire, piled up unceremoniously before me.</p> \n<p>There were the jars of buttercup-yellow preserved lemons, and the dinky pots of harissa paste, the colour of coagulating blood, from the period when I was determined to explore the wilder shores of the Levantine culinary tradition. There were things called “marmalade” which didn’t involve oranges, and pitch-black pastes made from damsons which I seem to recall needing for my home experiments in neo-rustic British nose-to-tail eating. And don’t get me started on the Asian stuff: the fermented bean pastes with endless permutations of chilli and dried shrimp; the misos of ever darkening shades; the rice wines and soys and vinegars.</p> \n<p>Some of these had been opened. I peered inside to find a few with a deep dimple where I had sampled this new genius purchase, and then realised I didn’t have a clue what to do with it. Others had developed furry moulds so thick I didn’t know whether to scoop them out or stroke them and get them baptised. And then there were those – oh the shame – where the seal hadn’t even broken.</p> \n<p>I should beat myself up here over the disgusting waste, and I do. It doesn’t matter how long it takes to throw something away: waste is still waste. But even more than that I mourn all those dishes that could have been. They were not undermined by lack of ingredients. I reckon I had even accumulated the makings for a couple of Yotam Ottolenghi’s simpler recipes. They were undermined by lack of commitment.</p> \n<p>I’m sure when I bought the myriad jars I meant it. I really was going to become a different kind of cook. I really was going to stop making the same old things. But I was going to become that different cook tomorrow. Or perhaps the day after that. Or next week.

Sounds simple, right?<br /></p>","byline":"Tony Naylor","body":"<p>Gourmets! Gastronauts! The unfeasibly greedy! Gather around in as tight a huddle as our bulging stomachs will allow, for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat\">How to Eat</a> is going where others are too complacent to tread. Yes, we are opening a Tupperware pandora’s box and taking a large bite out of the humble cheese sandwich. Identified <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/11537804/Britains-favourite-lunch-The-humble-cheese-sandwich.html\">last month</a> as the nation’s favourite weekday lunchtime repast, this is not just a snack but one of the building blocks of the British identity. One that, thankfully, has recently been exonerated after accusations it had played a principal role <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/gavrilo-princips-sandwich-79480741/?no-ist\">in starting the first world war</a>. As ever, below the line, please choose your words caerphilly. Do not turn the air blue. If necessary, brie the feta man.</p> \n<h2><strong>Cheese </strong></h2> \n<p>Call me a militant, but I feel it is essential. No matter how vigorously vegans dispute that point. But what cheese should you use and should it be sliced or grated? These are questions which go to the very heart of what you want, not just out of this sandwich, but life. Do you want frivolous novelty? Do you crave impractical continental ingredients which, somehow, make you feel more sophisticated? Or do you want proven, steadfast flavour combinations?</p> \n<p>Fundamentally, there are very few cheeses that truly work in a sandwich. If you wish to avoid creating a dry, claggy sanger of a muddled, indeterminate character, you need to use something hard, waxy and tangy in the lincolnshire poacher or mature cheddar line, which you may want to augment with a little red leicester or double gloucester. Wonderful as they may be elsewhere, a sandwich is no place for the crumbly and/or dense likes of feta; wensleydale; almost all Lancashire cheeses; goat’s cheese (that is a salad cheese, no matter how you moisten it with beetroot); brie (especially when paired, egregiously, with cranberries); any of the blue cheeses; cream cheese*; cheshire; stinking bishop or any other gooey cheeses which must be sealed in a lead Hazmat container in your fridge, to stop your neighbours complaining about the smell.</p> \n<p>Of course, manchego, Parmesan and halloumi are not sandwich cheeses. Nor, unless you want to spend half the sandwich spraining your tongue, trying to dislodge a wad of bread and cheese that has welded itself to the roof of your mouth, are processed cheese slices and (my beloved) Dairylea. Any added fruit or added herb cheeses are, naturally, disqualified because they are an offence against god. </p> \n<p>If you are wondering about mozzarella’s absence, it only plays a serious part in hot sandwiches, often partnered with pesto. In a cold sandwich, it is a curiously rubbery, often slightly granular interloper, which delivers scant milky flavour.</p> \n<p>* Unless that cream cheese is on a bagel with smoked salmon of course, but, then, that is more a smoked salmon sandwich than a cheese one. </p> \n<h2><strong>Slice or grate?</strong> </h2> \n<p>If creating a “<a href=\"https://www.greggs.co.uk/menu/sandwiches/cheddar-cheese-savoury-/\">cheese savoury</a>” filling with celery, carrot, onion etc, then grating the cheese is necessary to ensure that all the ingredients are thoroughly intermingled. If you bind that mix with something (mayonnaise), and diligently press the mix into the bread with a fork as you fill the sandwich, any spillages should be minimised. However, a grated cheese sandwich without that binding agent is a nightmare. As you will have observed at weddings and funerals, after returning from the buffet table, every time you pick up your sandwich, a bit of grated cheese falls out on to your plate, shirt, the table or floor. You end up picking most of the cheese up with your fingers in between bites of your, by now, almost empty sandwich. After a while, it really grates.</p> \n<p>Slicing is eminently preferable. It ensures complete crust-to-crust coverage and eradicates spillage. However, be aware that anything above a thickness of 5mm is overkill. Constructing a cheese sandwich is a delicate balancing act. You must ensure flavour but also that the drier constituents of the sandwich (bread, cheese), do not dominate in a way that makes that sandwich a chore. </p> \n<h2><strong>Bread </strong></h2> \n<p>Whether you prefer to call it or “doorstep” or “doorstop”, my message is this: please cut your slices thinner. A great hulking sandwich appeals to us in an intuitive way. It is aesthetically pleasing. It evokes a prelapsarian past of bucolic rural plenty, a merrie England which probably only ever existed in the minds of the fiendish admen who created it. However, that fat sandwich is also a major pain in the posterior to eat. Unless you are using a bread so fresh it is still warm from the baker’s oven (which in cafes and pubs or at home, 98.9% of us are not), that is a massive wad of carbs and solidified fat to chew on. It takes some serious masticating. I do not want to swig tea or beer with each mouthful (thus, washing away the flavours of the sandwich), in order to get it down. Moreover, the primary flavour of a cheese sandwich should be cheese not bread – that is the star of the show, let it shine. Restrain yourself to slices of no more than 1cm in thickness.</p> \n<p>A good-quality soft, white, impeccably fresh loaf is the ideal, although ordinary supermarket white sliced is entirely serviceable (Warburton’s toastie is How To Eat’s recommended brand). Indeed, that is one of the joys of the cheese sandwich. It is one of those food items, like ice-cream or bacon, which can never be truly bad. From the cheapest block cheese to the finest small-batch, extra-matured cheddar, from the woolliest white sliced to the priciest artisan sourdough (its lactic piquancy always welcome), all cheese sandwiches tickle the pleasure centres at some level. So long, that is, as you haven’t made it on worthy wholegrain or the kind of seeded loaf that is like chewing through the leg of a wicker chair. Brown and darker rye breads have their place, but certainly not on a cheese sandwich where a lack of moisture is a constant threat. </p> \n<h2><strong>A short note on soft baps … </strong></h2> \n<p>Ordinarily, not the go-to sandwich bread. But if out for a picnic or travelling, there is something uniquely brilliant about a cheese and tomato bap that has been wrapped in Clingfilm for hours, and allowed to come to room temperature, so that the cheese begins to sweat out its oils and the juice from the tomatoes has had plenty of time to soak into the bread. Add a little salt, and even the blandest British tomatoes and the dullest processed cheddar will amalgamate into a flavour bomb that is so wet at its centre you can almost slurp it down.</p> \n<p>That point about temperature is a key for all cheese sandwiches, of course. Get all the components out of the fridge and let them warm up before constructing your sandwich. As Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2011/jun/11/sandwich-recipes-hugh-fearnley-whittingstall\">rightly observed</a> in reference to chilled supermarket butties: “Who wants bread, butter and cheese at 3C?”</p> \n<h2><strong>Desirable extras</strong> </h2> \n<p>Raw onion (preferably red or mild Spanish, to limit halitosis); spring onion; caramelised onion; Branston Pickle (I am a late convert, but yes); pickled gherkins; good homemade coleslaw with cabbage; baby gem or iceberg lettuce for sweet, refreshing crunch. Please note: you generally only need one of those extras <em>plus</em> iceberg lettuce. That is, in order to retain the structural integrity of your sandwich and to ensure that all the ingredients can fully express themselves.</p> \n<h2><strong>Borderline extras </strong></h2> \n<p>Celery (banal on its own, but acceptable in a cheese savoury mix; see also carrot); tomato (ripe and salted); apple chutney (not overly sweet); a handful of crushed ready salted or cheese-and-onion crisps, for texture (but only on a very liberally, mayo-moistened sandwich).</p> \n<h2><strong>Undesirable extras </strong></h2> \n<p>Ham, chicken or tuna (what you have there is a ham, chicken or tuna sandwich, in which the cheese has been relegated to a “seasoning” role; see also fish fingers); piccalilli; cucumber (beyond pointless); beetroot; egg; horseradish; Marmite; and also Worcestershire sauce, tabasco, cayenne pepper or any other pushy, sharp-elbowed sauce and seasoning which people occasionally and idiotically use to try to jazz-up “cheese savoury”.</p> \n<h2><strong>Spreads </strong></h2> \n<p>Butter. Real butter. Not margarine. Not a low-fat spread. Not that voodoo ersatz butter that is spreadable straight from the fridge. Life is short. Accept no substitutes. Oh … and, of course, every cheese sandwich needs a dollop of mayonnaise. For moisture, for slick mouthfeel, for a little vinegary tang.</p> \n<h2><strong>The cut </strong></h2> \n<p>Horizontally through the middle of the bread. Never diagonally. Eat the less enjoyable “square edged” bottom half first, as it has the larger, drier crust area, and then sit back and savour that relatively luxurious, rounded top-half.</p> \n<h2><strong>Drink </strong><br /></h2> \n<p>A huge, Sports Direct-sized mug of brick-red tea, or a zippy, lightly bitter golden or pale ale. </p> \n<h2><strong>When </strong></h2> \n<p>Dinner or tea. Although, I find the cheese sandwich is a reasonably effective breakfast hangover remedy, for those light-to-moderate days of fuzziness, when you still have the wherewithal to actually make yourself a sandwich.</p> \n<p>So, the cheese sandwich – how do you eat yours?</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819360472/3d155c8f-2915-478e-b543-aa42776458a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Alamy","altText":"The full-on rustic approach … not without its pitfalls.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Alamy"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-05-05T10:00:22Z","lastModified":"2015-05-05T10:03:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":772,"contributors":[{"name":"Tony Naylor","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/tonynaylor"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Sandwiches","Food & drink","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/sandwiches","webTitle":"Sandwiches"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Tony Naylor","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/tonynaylor"}}],"series":{"title":"How to eat","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/how-to-eat"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/48v53","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/05/how-to-eat-a-cheese-sandwich"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430819360472/3d155c8f-2915-478e-b543-aa42776458a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The full-on rustic approach … not without its pitfalls.

Quiche is one of those meals, but unlike the other foods – quivering blancmange, trifle fingers, frozen cheesecakes – whose appeal slipped away with their novelty, quiche still feels like a dish to be celebrated. There are the traditional ones rich with cheese and egg, lighter types cast in filo or wholemeal crusts, quiches robust enough to survive the packed lunch box and those so light that they tremble on your fork. Here are a couple of my favourites.</p> \n<h2><strong>Herbed salmon and ricotta quiche</strong></h2> \n<p>This one’s a light quiche for a summer picnic that uses ricotta instead of the usual cream and matching that brightness with fresh herbs and lemon. The crust is a little crumblier than some thanks to the wholemeal flour, but you’ll find it more substantial and more flavourful, too.</p> \n<p><strong>For the pastry</strong><br />100g plain white flour<br />75g wholemeal flour<br />2 tsp dried parsley or dill<br />100g salted butter<br />2-3 tbsp cold water</p> \n<p><strong> For the filling</strong><br />250g salmon fillets<br />50g watercress or spinach <br />250g ricotta<br />150ml double cream<br />3 large eggs<br />Zest of 1 lemon<br />A couple of small handfuls of parsley, roughly chopped<br />2-3 fronds of dill, roughly chopped<br />Salt and black pepper</p> \n<p>1 Combine the plain and wholemeal flours and the dried herbs in a large bowl. Cube the butter and add it to the flour, rubbing it in with your fingertips until there are no visible pieces of fat remaining. The mixture should be fine and sandy. Add 2 tbsp cold water and cut it into the dry ingredients using a small knife, working everything together until it begins to form small clumps. There should be no dry flour left in the bowl – if there is, add a drop more water.</p> \n<p>2 If the dough’s sticky, wrap in clingfilm and chill it in the fridge for 20-30 minutes before rolling. Otherwise, go straight to rolling: gather the dough into a ball and roll, on a lightly floured work surface, to a disc large enough to line a 20-23cm round tart/flan dish or springform cake tin. Press the pastry firmly into the sides and trim off any excess. It may be slightly crumbly thanks to the wholemeal flour, but just work slowly, roll carefully and patch up any breaks or holes with more pastry. Prick the base several times with a fork. Place in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to minimise shrinkage during baking. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.</p> \n<p>3 Once the pastry case is well chilled and the oven is at the right temperature, line the pastry with a sheet of baking parchment and fill with a thick layer of baking weights. Bake for 20 minutes before removing the baking parchment parcel and baking uncovered for a further 5 minutes or so.</p> \n<p>4 While the pastry bakes, place the salmon fillets on a baking tray and slide on to another oven shelf. Cook for 10-12 minutes – just barely long enough for the salmon to start flaking. You don’t want to overcook it.</p> \n<p>5 Wilt the watercress or spinach in a sieve or steamer set over a pan of simmering water. Whisk half of the ricotta together with the double cream, eggs and lemon zest and season generously. Stir in the herbs.</p> \n<p>6 Once the pastry and salmon are both cooked, turn the oven down to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Break the salmon into generous chunks and place in the case. Add the wilted greens then dollop the remaining ricotta on top in scattered spoonfuls. Pour over the cream-ricotta mixture and nudge the lot around gently with a spoon to just roughly combine.</p> \n<p>7 Bake for 35-45 minutes, or until the filling is just barely set in the centre. Leave to cool for at least 30 minutes before eating.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/28/quick-quiche-recipes-for-your-packed-lunch\">Quick quiche recipes for your packed lunch | The lunch box</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2><strong>Roasted cauliflower, gruyere and pancetta quiche</strong></h2> \n<p>Browning the cauliflower in the oven first gives it a robustly nutty edge, helping the veg to hold its own against the clout of gruyere and pancetta. Try swapping the pancetta for a couple of handfuls of finely shredded kale if you want to ring the changes.</p> \n<p><strong>For the pastry</strong><br />90g unsalted butter<br />175g plain flour<br />50g gruyere cheese, finely grated<br />2-3 tbsp cold water<strong><br /> </strong></p> \n<p><strong>For the filling<br /></strong>400g cauliflower florets<br />2 tbsp cooking oil<br />100g bacon or pancetta, diced<br />150ml single cream<br />100ml whole milk<br />100g gruyere cheese, finely grated<br />3 large eggs<br />Salt and black pepper</p> \n<p>1 Rub the butter into the flour using your fingertips. Once the butter is fully incorporated and the mixture is sandy in texture and stir in a third (50g) of the grated cheese. Add 2 tbsp of cold water and cut into the flour mix using a small knife, working the liquid into the dry ingredients until a dough begins to form in small clumps and all the flour has been moistened. Add a little extra water if necessary, but it’s best to use the minimum amount of liquid necessary to get a firm dough – this will keep the pastry short and crumbly, as it should be.</p> \n<p>2 If the dough is too sticky to roll out, pat it into a flat disc, wrap it in clingfilm and refrigerate it for 30 minutes or so. Otherwise, roll straight away to a disc big enough to line the base and sides of a 23cm round quiche/flan tin. Press it into the sides, taking care not to stretch the dough. Trim off any excess then prick all over the base with a fork. Place in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes and preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.</p> \n<p>3 While the pastry chills, boil the cauliflower florets for a 2 minutes, trimming down any very large cauliflower florets beforehand. Drain and leave to dry. Toss the blanched cauliflower pieces in the oil, spread them out on a baking tray and roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, turning halfway through, until brown and black spots begin to creep across the florets.</p> \n<p>4 Fry the bacon or pancetta for a few minutes until it is just beginning to crisp then set aside to cool.</p> \n<p>5 Once the pastry case has chilled, line the inside with baking parchment and fill with baking weights. Bake (with the cauliflower, if that’s still cooking – both bake at the same temperature) for 20 minutes before removing the baking parchment and the baking weights and returning the pastry to the oven to dry for a further 5 minutes.</p> \n<p>6 While the pastry case bakes, prepare the cream filling. Combine the cream, milk and remaining cheese in a pan over a low heat and warm until the cheese has melted. Season the mixture, going easy on the salt. Whisk the eggs together in a mixing bowl then add the cream mixture slowly to them, stirring all the while.</p> \n<p>7 Spread the roasted cauliflower florets over the base of the pre-baked pastry case then scatter over the bacon bits. Pour on the egg and cream mixture, filling it just shy of the pastry rim.</p> \n<p>8 Turn the oven temperature down to 180C/350F/gas mark 4 and bake for 45 minutes – or until puffy, golden brown and set. There should be only the slightest hint of a jiggle at the centre of the quiche. Leave to cool for a while before eating.</p>","section":"Lifestyle","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433413215142/43db3c28-f31a-4e03-a596-731713b8828b-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jill Mead for the Guardian","altText":"Herbed salmon and ricotta quiche and rosted cauliflower, gruyer and pancetta quiche","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Jill Mead for the Guardian"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-06T05:00:13Z","lastModified":"2015-06-09T15:04:35Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":34,"contributors":[{"name":"Ruby Tandoh","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ruby-tandoh"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Food & drink","Baking","Life and style"],"tags":[{"id":"lifeandstyle/food-and-drink","webTitle":"Food & drink"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/baking","webTitle":"Baking"},{"id":"lifeandstyle/lifeandstyle","webTitle":"Life and style"}],"section":{"id":"lifeandstyle"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ruby Tandoh","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ruby-tandoh"}}],"series":{"title":"Ruby bakes","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/lifeandstyle/series/ruby-bakes"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"lifeandstyle"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/06/quiche-recipes-salmon-ricotta-cauliflower-ruby-tandoh","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49fj8","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/06/quiche-recipes-salmon-ricotta-cauliflower-ruby-tandoh","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jun/06/quiche-recipes-salmon-ricotta-cauliflower-ruby-tandoh"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/4/1433413163318/a3db6828-8562-481c-beb1-1b913e3ca9fe-2060x1178.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1178,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A lighter, picnic-style herbed salmon and ricotta quiche (right) alongside the more robust roasted cauliflower, gruyere and pancetta version to the left.
