Out from the tunnel and to a prize fighter’s introduction came Slaven Bilic, the new West Ham United manager.</p> \n<p>The evening was not really about him. He was not even in charge of the team for this Europa League first round qualifying tie, having handed that responsibility to Terry Westley, the Academy manager. And yet his presence transcended the occasion.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/slaven-bilic-west-ham-lusitans-disrespect\">Slaven Bilic’s first night at West Ham ends in row with Andorran minnows</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Bilic was the man that the fans had come to welcome and this was, unmistakably, the beginning of a new era – one that the club hope will see them grow in stature before their move to the Olympic Stadium in 2016-17.</p> \n<p>European football is a big part of it, too. West Ham last tasted continental competition in the 2006 Uefa Cup, when <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2006/sep/29/match.sport2\">they were ejected in the first round by Palermo</a>, but they took sound steps upon their return.</p> \n<p>The Andorran part-timers of Lusitans, whose home stadium holds 900 and who brought 82 fans to east London, offered little opposition and West Ham cantered to their victory. They had to wait until the 40th minute for Diafra Sakho’s breakthrough but this was a mismatch on every level.</p> \n<p>Bilic watched from the stands and he could be happy at the workout which was provided, as much as anything else. The abiding image, though, was that of him wearing a claret-and-blue scarf and waving to the crowd beforehand, as bubbles floated across the pitch.</p> \n<p>In his first programme notes Bilic had articulated the hope that this would be “the start of a very special journey” and it was certainly the start of a very long one. Thirty-nine days had elapsed since the end of the Premier League season, multiple British tennis players are still involved at Wimbledon and yet here we were, kicking off the new campaign. West Ham must get through three further two-legged ties just to reach the group phase of this bloated competition.</p> \n<p>It was vaguely unreal. Upton Park was sold out in anticipation of Bilic’s debut, yet nobody was entirely sure as to whether this truly represented his first game in charge. Would it go on his record? It surely should, given that the Croat <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/west-ham-slaven-bilic-new-manager\">was appointed as the successor to Sam Allardyce</a> on 9 June.</p> \n<p>Then again, he had designated control of the team to Westley, who had picked four youngsters in the starting lineup, including Reece Oxford. At 16 years and 198 days, the defensive midfielder became the club’s youngest ever first-team player.</p> \n<p>There had been the pre-match hunt for a definitive clue. Who had signed the team-sheet? Bilic or Westley? It was neither. James Tomkins, the captain, did the honours.</p> \n<p>The absence of names on the back of the players’ shirts added to the unusual feel of the occasion, while the half-and-half scarves on sale outside the ground before kick-off were the last word in niche collectibles.</p> \n<p>Predictably, it was one-way traffic. Lusitans kept men behind the ball and they were uncompromising in the challenge – to put it politely. Tempers flared at times and Oxford was booked for a tackle midway through the first half, which Jos&eacute; Antonio Aguilar rather made the most of. West Ham’s breakthrough came when Diafra Sakho nodded in from Mauro Z&aacute;rate’s cross and the second followed Z&aacute;rate’s lovely flick and Morgan Amalfitano’s pull-back, which Sakho blasted home.</p> \n<p>The home crowd were annoyed by Lusitans’ play-acting but there was little else to trouble them. Their team enjoyed total dominance and Tomkins added the third with a second-half header. The 19-year-old substitute, Josh Cullen, was denied a fourth in stoppage time when his long-range shot hit the crossbar.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/2/1435873670971/West-Hams-Slaven-Bilic-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The new West Ham manager, Slaven Bilic, is introduced to the Upton Park crowd before the Europa League first round qualifier against Lusitans.

They warned that the momentum could soon be lost if it wasn’t translated into increased visibility for the domestic game. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>We were immense and hopefully we did the nation proud. That was the aim, to try and inspire young girls</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Steph Houghton, England captain</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>England captain Steph Houghton said she “couldn’t be prouder” of an England team that had started the tournament slowly but had gathered belief as it had progressed.</p> \n<p>That was just one of a number of parallels with the Italia 90 England men’s team; Gary Lineker, a key member of that side, was one of several pundits who voiced hopes that the tournament would be looked back on as a similarly transformational moment for the women’s game. </p> \n<p>“Women and girls across the country – as well as many men and boys, I’m sure – will have woken up with a new set of sporting heroes,” said Ruth Holdaway, chief executive of Women in Sport. </p> \n<p>“Football now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to make itself the sport of choice for women and girls up and down the country; it is an opportunity we cannot afford to lose.”</p> \n<p>Houghton said she was “absolutely devastated” when she saw the ball cross the line after spinning off the boot of defender Laura Bassett and looping over goalkeeper Karen Bardsley in the last minute of a match that looked to be heading for extra time. </p> \n<p>“We were immense and hopefully we did the nation proud. That was the aim, to try and inspire young girls. We were that close – football really can be very cruel,” said Houghton. </p> \n<p>As her teammates and manager Mark Sampson rallied around Bassett, BBC presenter Jacqui Oatley said the defender’s misfortune would only endear her to the public. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/02/england-women-laura-bassett-mother-bounce-back\">Laura will bounce back after England own goal, insists Bassett’s mother</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Oatley, a player until injury prematurely ended her career, said the women’s game had made steady strides since the FA launched the Women’s Super League (WSL) two years ago, but that clubs and sponsors needed to seize the moment. </p> \n<p>The WSL, which has been on pause during the tournament, returns on 12 July. The women’s FA Cup final – in which Bassett’s Notts County Ladies will play Chelsea at Wembley – is on 1 August. </p> \n<p>“It can be a transformational moment, but whether it will be is the most important thing. It’s down to the marketeers, and they need to act quickly while people are still talking about women’s football,” Oatley said. </p> \n<p>“After 2012 there was a lot of buoyancy, but nothing was actually done. Something structurally needs to change in terms of the way the game is marketed.”</p> \n<p>England manager Mark Sampson, who praised the “superhuman” effort of his players, said: “I’m going to demand that everyone back home really ups their game and we commit everything we can to keep growing this sport in our country.”</p> \n<p>Holdaway said that the domestic game remained “underfunded and under-appreciated”. She added: “Hopefully sponsors will wake up to women’s football as a great opportunity to raise their profile and enhance their brand value by supporting and further developing the momentum behind women’s sport in the UK.”</p> \n<p>While there are plenty of parallels with the heartache of the men’s team down the years, there is no comparison when it comes to financial rewards. There are only 27 full-time professionals in the WSL and others, such Deutsche Bank analyst Claire Rafferty, have to balance playing with a full-time job. </p> \n<p>“It’s a two-pronged attack. On the one hand, you want to inspire people to buy tickets, get commercial sponsors more interested, get sports editors interested,” said Oatley, once the first female commentator on Match of the Day. </p> \n<p>“The second prong is to get young girls going out and kicking a ball with their brothers and sisters in the garden. The more young girls play and the better the standard of coaching is, the more talent will come through.” </p> \n<p>Participation in the women’s game is growing – in 1993 there were just 80 registered girls’ teams, today there are 5,143, with 1,437 registered adult sides. But there are still fears that negative stereotypes persist among some parents and teachers. </p> \n<p>For half a century, women were banned from even playing football in England, but the FA has thrown all its weight behind the Lionesses. As well as making household names of some of the players, it has launched a We Can Play campaign aimed at dispelling myths around women’s football and making it attractive to seven to11-year-old girls. </p> \n<p>The FA’s research showed that even among girls of that age who played football, four out of five didn’t feel confident doing so due to peer pressure and negative stereotyping. </p> \n<p>“The amount of TV exposure we have had and the attention women’s football has got has been brilliant. We want to be role models and hopefully girls are inspired to get to the World Cup and start playing at a younger age,” said Houghton after the Japan match. </p> \n<p>The research also showed that parents were far less likely to encourage daughters to play football than sons.</p> \n<p>“Women’s football has had an image problem in this country, something they don’t suffer from in the US or Scandinavia,” said Oatley, who will front BBC3’s coverage of England’s third-place play-off against Germany at 8.30pm on Saturday.</p> \n<p>“Hopefully, one of the positive things from this World Cup will be that mums and dads will look at what these England players have achieved and think about it as a desirable sport.”</p> \n<p>Amid the tributes flooding Twitter from current and former England players –including Lineker, Rio Ferdinand and Wayne Rooney – winger Karen Carney wrote: “Our aim was 1) gold medal 2) inspire a nation!! We didn’t get our first task but I’m sure we have got our second.”</p> \n<p>A Sport England spokesman said that the success of Mark Sampson’s side could convince more girls to try the sport, amid ongoing efforts to persuade more teenage girls to stay active. “We really hope that their success will help to inspire more girls and women to try football, however and wherever it suits them,” he said. </p> \n<p>Meanwhile, there may also be renewed focus on the circumstances that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/29/kelly-simmons-great-britain-womens-football-olympics-rio-2016-world-cup\">prevented Team GB entering a women’s side in the Rio Olympics</a> next summer and potentially capitalising on the momentum generated in Canada. </p> \n<p>England’s semi-final place would have enabled them to qualify, but internal politics among the four home nations meant that the FA’s bid to enter a team was blocked.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/d2da6167f710765eb6b464b5a67aed4f28f45e7c/0_0_2331_1400/2331.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1400,"width":2331,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Wang Yuguo/Xinhua Press/Corbis","altText":"England celebrate scoring during the semi-final against Japan at the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup.
