Rehabilitation for fractures can be up to eight weeks. Tottenham begin their Premier League campaign at Manchester United on 8 August.</p> \n<p>The club released a statement confirming the injury. “The France goalkeeper will continue to work alongside the first-team squad to build up his fitness in a bid to be ready for the start of the season,” Tottenham said. “Our medical team will continue to monitor his rehabilitation and progress during pre-season.”</p> \n<p>Lloris, who was recruited from Lyon for &pound;8m in 2012, is Tottenham’s first-choice goalkeeper and signed a new contract last summer on improved terms to run through to 2019. However, the Frenchman admitted last month that there comes a time “to think about yourself” when it became clear David de Gea’s future at United was in doubt after Real Madrid declared an interest in luring the goalkeeper back to the Spanish capital.</p> \n<p>The 28-year-old Lloris has long made it clear to the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, he is anxious to play in the Champions League, where he had featured in each of his four years with his previous side, particularly before Euro 2016 in his homeland. Yet the France captain’s time at White Hart Lane has failed to yield a return to Europe’s elite competition and a fifth-place finish last season ensured the Europa League awaits yet again.“You don’t know what could happen,” said Lloris in an interview with L’Equipe. “There is one important thing: there is a moment to think about yourself, to sit down and reflect, but when that moment has passed and the season starts, you’re fully committed to the club’s project and to the team (you’re with).” Asked if that moment to reflect had now come, he added: “Voil&agrave;. But you don’t control everything.”</p> \n<p>Spurs are adamant that one of their most consistent players over recent seasons is not available for transfer. Should Lloris be unavailable at the start of the Premier League campaign, they will turn to Michel Vorm, who made only four top-flight appearances for the London club last season following his &pound;5m arrival from Swansea City.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436810301776/Hugo-Lloris-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Tottenham goalkeeper Hugo Lloris has suffered a fractured wrist.

On Sunday at 12pm it had been the press room, on Monday at 1pm, the stage was set in the directors’ suite and the club president Florentino P&eacute;rez did attend along with his board, who stood to applaud. There were fans too, around 2,000 of them waiting in the sunshine, where a platform had been built on the pitch adorned with the trophies Casillas won during a 17-year career here.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/12/iker-casillas-real-madrid-la-liga-porto\">No fanfare for Real Madrid legend Iker Casillas as he leaves for Porto</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Casillas appeared and they chanted his name as he made his way, first towards the trophies and then towards them. But, while their numbers were relatively small with this act held before lunchtime on a working day, probably more significant were the other chants: “Sergio Ramos is not for sale!” directed not so much at Manchester United as at P&eacute;rez, and “Florentino, resign!” This was not really a fond farewell for Casillas and nor did it do that much to repair the damage done a day before. It may even have made it worse.</p> \n<p>History repeats itself, first as tragedy, second as farce. After 48 hours in which Casillas’s departure was on then off, then on then off again, came 24 hours in which he publicly “left” twice. Another day, another goodbye. This was an odd and sometimes uncomfortable occasion, much of it conducted in Orwellian Newspeak, as if Sunday never happened and yet all was about Sunday. When the former captain stood up to speak, he smiled awkwardly. “This one really is the last one, eh,” he said.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457483097__\n</div> \n<p>Casillas spoke for a few seconds and had not prepared anything. Nor did he face any questions; it was the president who held a press conference, not him. “As we were saying,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/11/real-madrid-iker-casillas-25-year-stay-over-porto\" title=\"\">the new Porto goalkeeper</a> offered, almost by way of excuse. “If there has been any discrepancy, I am sorry,” he added. “We’ll remember the good moments.”</p> \n<p>By then P&eacute;rez had spoken; now P&eacute;rez spoke again. Casillas sat down and listened in silence as everybody talked about him. P&eacute;rez took the lectern again and took questions, almost as if Casillas were not there. This wasn’t about him; this first part of the event, before he headed out to the pitch where the trophies and the fans awaited him, was not much of a goodbye.</p> \n<p>Instead, it was a presidential defence, an opportunity for P&eacute;rez to justify himself – Madrid had helped Casillas leave, not forced him to – and to challenge the good guy/bad guy narrative. When the goalkeeper later stepped into the sunshine, without P&eacute;rez, and the fans received him with cheers and the president with calls to resign, it appeared that the task may have been necessary but may not be easy.</p> \n<p>“I had always planned to hold this press conference, only without Iker,” P&eacute;rez claimed, and he might as well have done. “But I wanted Iker, our great captain, to be here,” he said. The doubt was why Casillas had agreed, why he sat there in silence, almost invisible.</p> \n<p>“What had changed since yesterday?” P&eacute;rez was asked. “Nothing,” he said and yet at the same time he did admit that he had called Casillas in “so that people don’t think that there is anything strange,” adding: “I have affection for him, despite what people want to see.” There were indeed warm words, even if the sincerity of the sentiment is another question, with the president describing Casillas as “the best goalkeeper in Spanish football history” and as a “magnificent human being”, noting: “we love him, respect him, and admire him.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"607166ac6b65021fe991a2934e3be78001d99cf9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436797830632/d41e3ed3-5f0b-4e72-9388-4bd2635b27a0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Iker Casillas walks over to the fans who had come to say goodbye to him at the Bernab&eacute;u on Monday.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iker Casillas walks over to the fans who had come to say goodbye to him at the Bernab&eacute;u on Monday.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul White/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>But the key focus, reinforced as the press conference went on, was to counteract reports that his relationship with the captain had been strained or that he had forced Casillas out, starting with Sunday’s original departure. “Iker wanted an extremely austere, simple goodbye and we accepted that even though we didn’t want it,” P&eacute;rez claimed. And, besides, he added: the club is working on a friendly against Porto to be played “as soon as possible”.</p> \n<p>“Iker is leaving because he wanted to, and we can only respect that wish because he earned that right,” P&eacute;rez continued. “No one asked him to leave. A few days ago he got an offer from Porto and he asked us to consider it. We did that. He has earned the right for the club to make an effort on his behalf.”</p> \n<p>P&eacute;rez also called Casillas “irreplaceable” although he aspires to replace him with David De Gea. All the while, Casillas sat in the front row, listening as P&eacute;rez claimed to have “always defended” him, that he wanted the goalkeeper to “retire at the club”, that he would have liked him to stay, and that he found it “incomprehensible” and “unacceptable” that some supporters whistled him. “The door will always be open for Casillas,” P&eacute;rez said. It has been open for some time.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/13/1436797584610/Iker-Casillas-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The departing Real Madrid captain and goalkeeper Iker Casillas finds himself surrounded by the trophies he won while at the club at an official send-off at the Bernabéu on Monday.
