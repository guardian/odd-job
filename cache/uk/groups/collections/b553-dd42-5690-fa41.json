Born in Canada, he was the first man to play for England without having played football in Britain. Few England fans knew much about him when Sven-Goran Eriksson gave him his first cap, at 20 years of age, in 2001. Three years later it was revealed that he was the fittest member of Eriksson’s squad at the European Championship, but he still had to survive booing at the start of the ill-starred, Wag-infested 2006 World Cup campaign before the fans voted him England’s player of the tournament and of the season, a double distinction that remains unique.</p> \n<p>There is no telling what he might have achieved had fate not dealt him a series of such vicious blows after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2007/may/31/newsstory.bayernmunich\" title=\"\">United paid &pound;17m for his signature</a> in the summer of 2007. Until being permanently sidelined by a series of knee injuries, he had certainly done enough to show he was not going to be consumed by the flames of celebrity that lick at the heels of all England’s international footballers.</p> \n<p>What made Hargreaves different was that he had not been created by the English system. He had avoided the experience of being cosseted from childhood, surrounded by agents and other sycophants, and showered with absurd amounts of money at an age when he might still have been doing a paper round. Everything he was, he made of himself. Everything he achieved he fought for against the odds, going to a foreign country at 16 and learning a new language, developing his self-reliance in a ferociously competitive environment.</p> \n<p>Quite a contrast there with the young men who lost two of their three matches in the Czech Republic this month, and were lucky to win the other. Every one of Gareth Southgate’s players had come through English academies, and none of them – even the generally estimable Harry Kane, who did not manage a single goal in 270 minutes of play – produced anything decisive when it really counted.</p> \n<p>This week’s failure provoked scornful references to the claim made two years ago by Greg Dyke of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/sep/04/greg-dyke-england-world-cup-qatar-2022\" title=\"\">England’s intention to win the World Cup in 2022</a>. The chairman of the Football Association could not be faulted for demonstrating ambition. How would his critics have reacted to an official announcement that elimination in the semi-finals would represent an acceptable performance? It is equally foolish to mock the FA’s technical director, Dan Ashworth, for promoting a scheme to get all the national teams, junior and senior, to adopt the same basic possession-based philosophy.</p> \n<p>Keeping the ball is no guarantee of success, particularly when much of it is thrown away by slack passing, but it is a perfectly sound base from which to begin a reconstruction. Southgate’s players had the majority of possession against Sweden and Italy, and more or less parity with Portugal. What they lacked was a figure with the personality and the dynamism to break the defensive line by doing the unexpected.</p> \n<p>There, in the question of mentality rather than technique, lies the real problem. Those young English players good enough to win a place in the academy of a top Premier League club are given too much, too soon in respect of material comforts and rewards, and not enough of whatever it takes to build their sense of responsibility and initiative.</p> \n<p>At under-17 level, England won the European Championship in 2010 and 2014. The talent must be there. But when a top Premier League manager needs a player capable of changing a game, he looks abroad for a finished product. The effect on the attitude of young English contenders for the same position cannot be good, when they know that by sitting on the bench – if they are lucky – or by going out on loan they will still be earning every week what the average English worker is paid in a year.</p> \n<p>So Chelsea’s Josh McEachran, the creative fulcrum of the 2010 European Under-17 Championship winners, has since been loaned to five different clubs and now, at 22, must find a way of reviving a moribund career. The 18-year-old Patrick Roberts, named in the team of the tournament in 2014, made three appearances in the Championship in the second half of last season, all as a substitute. If Fulham were to accept the &pound;5m allegedly offered by Manchester City for his signature last week, what would the future hold for his development at a club for whom Premier League and European success is a necessity, and whose motive could be simply to fill their quota of “home-produced” players, with the possibility of profiting from a future sale?</p> \n<p>It is a system guaranteed to produce underachievement and wasted talent. The biggest clubs are not to be blamed for stocking up with players good enough to compete at the top level in the Champions League, but they are demonstrably not doing enough to teach their young English players how to exist in the world created for them. Is there no one capable of persuading a 20-year-old senior international that inhaling laughing gas is unprofessional? Or showing a gifted 19-year-old that he is damaging his career by apparently getting wasted in Tenerife? Or even convincing a 21-year-old coming off a worryingly unsatisfactory season that circulating an apparently harmless picture of himself sitting poolside in the Balearics does not convey a good impression?</p> \n<p>Bobby Moore and Bryan Robson liked a drink, sometimes two. But they did not have to fight their way into the West Ham or the West Brom first team through foreign team-mates hardened by Champions League and World Cup experience. The challenge today is different for young men whose rewards are completely disproportionate to their actual achievements, making the need for effective pastoral care even greater.</p> \n<p>This is not a peripheral concern. In terms of establishing priorities, creating a sense of responsibility and encouraging good decision-making on the pitch, it is as important as the quality of the actual coaching. And since it is unlikely to be addressed, it is difficult to imagine England succeeding at anything other than the fish-in-a-barrel world of qualifying tournaments ever again.</p> \n<p>Southgate may or may not be a good coach, but the root cause of what happened this week is far beyond his control.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435324297744/Harry-Kane-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Harry Kane failed to score during the European Under-21 Championship amid a disappointing campaign from England.

Capable of scoring from almost anywhere beyond the halfway line, she combined pace, vision, technique and power, usually in an attacking midfield or second striker role.</p> \n<p>Such attributes did not prevent her struggling to get time off work from her job as a fitness instructor at a leisure centre in order to star in the 1995 World Cup in Sweden. In the end she had to beg sympathetic colleagues to cover shifts the boss initially refused to release her from.</p> \n<p>It all seems a long way from the business class flights and the series of five-star hotels in Moncton, Montreal, Ottawa and now Vancouver the class of 2015 are enjoying. On Tuesday England made the five-and-a-half-hour trip from Ottawa to Vancouver on a private plane specially chartered by Fifa. Each player had a row of three seats to themselves. In 1995 Spacey and her fellow part-timers – (the majority of Sampson’s squad are professionals earning up to &pound;70,000 a year) – including Clare Taylor, a postal worker, and Donna Smith, a firefighter, would have marvelled at the chefs, psychologists and exercise specialists accompanying England on their journey to the edge of the Pacific.</p> \n<p>“We had nothing like the resources the women’s team have these days,” says Spacey, now 49, who recalls the tiredness and stiffness involved in having to travel between matches on an overnight Swedish train before being eliminated by Germany in the quarter-finals.</p> \n<p>Far from jealous of the luxury cocooning of her successors, Sampson’s right-hand woman is simply proud to be part of the legacy she helped create. “It would be churlish to begrudge this squad anything,” she says. “I’ve had my time, I loved being a player but I’ve got no hang-ups about not being 20 or 30 years younger. I just consider myself very lucky to still be involved in helping Mark.”</p> \n<p>She hopes a by-product of potential English World Cup glory will be an increase in the number of women enrolling for the FA’s coaching courses. With her daughter, Sophie, now 19, Spacey – already a holder of the A licence – has the time needed to work towards the next and final step. She intends to secure her pro licence in the near future.</p> \n<p>When she does, she will become only the fifth woman in England to hold European football’s gold standard qualification, something now mandatory for Premier League managers.</p> \n<p>This dearth is partly explained by the fact that no women are included among the 40-plus intake on the FA’s current A licence course. Spacey regards this as a blip. “There’s none on the one happening now but, to put it in context, there were eight on the February course and there will be four women on the next one,” says the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2001/may/08/newsstory.sport1\" title=\"\">former Arsenal striker</a> and Fulham manager.</p> \n<p>There are concerns that, of the 24 coaches present at the start of Canada 2015 only eight were female but Spacey remains reasonably relaxed about an apparent disconnect. Indeed she regards it as an inevitable part of the game’s evolution and believes that, given time and patience, this imbalance will correct itself.</p> \n<p>“It takes a long time to get to international level as a coach, you can’t just be parachuted in,” she says. “But more and more female coaches are coming through the system so, maybe by the time the next World Cup comes round it will be more like half and half.</p> \n<p>“You just can’t say there should be X number of women in these positions. What about the best person for the job? There’s a strong argument for that. It should be the right person regardless of their sex.</p> \n<p>“There are arguments for having women coaches in women’s football and arguments for female teams having male coaches. Mark and I have a learnt a lot from working with each other and we’re still learning.”</p> \n<p>At 32, he is 17 years Spacey’s junior but she regards the Welshman as anything but a novice. “Mark’s very clever tactically,” she says. “He puts an awful lot of work into making sure he’s the best he can be, you see it in the way he prepares for every game.”</p> \n<p>She can envisage a day when, an albeit limited, number of women coach male teams, with the change most likely to come at academy level where some female pioneers are already employed: “I think you’ll see them working in men’s football in the future. Initially it will probably be in academies but I think opportunities will increase for those that want to work with men.</p> \n<p>“It takes time to work through all the various levels of qualifications you need though. You can’t rush through them. You have to put in the coaching hours. There’s no quick short-cut. For me there’s an argument for developing female coaches with younger age groups and slowly but surely bringing them up to senior level.”</p> \n<p>The important thing is that there now exists what Spacey terms a clear pathway for those seeking to follow in the footsteps of Powell, Sampson’s predecessor. She readily acknowledges its existence is partly down to the efforts of a man.</p> \n<p>“During Howard Wilkinson’s time as the FA’s technical director he was a real advocate for women’s football,” she says. “Howard was a real help in setting up a structure we should be proud of.</p> \n<p>“He was a big supporter of ours. Without people like Howard and Hope we’d still be fighting to be able to pay our own way to play here in Canada. If we succeed in this tournament it will be a tribute to all the people who have worked so hard, for so long, behind the scenes.”</p> \n<p>For now, the sky remains near cloudless as the Lionesses sip lattes at a hip urban coffee shop before taking a morning stroll down to Vancouver’s Sunset Beach. No one is more delighted to see them enjoying their moment in the sun than Spacey.</p> \n<p>“I played in a pioneering England team but I hope this one will be a successful England,” she says. “The women’s game has made incredible strides in the last 20 years. Now we have a real chance to keep that progress going.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/26/1435328223805/Marieanne-Spacey-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The England Women assistant coach, Marieanne Spacey, believes the team are ready to topple Canada in the Women's World Cup quarter-final on Saturday.

Or in other words: the ball is round – but only those who come from outer space know the actual dimensions of our sport … For me personally, the museum is a labour of love. But do not get me wrong: I’m not ready for the museum nor for a waxwork yet.”</p> \n<p>Fifa said that his comments, at an event held at the Fifa museum in Zurich, were in line <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/02/sepp-blatter-fifa-president-resigns\" title=\"\">with his speech on 2 June</a> when he did not mention resigning but did promise to lay down his mandate at an extraordinary congress between December and March.</p> \n<p>In that same speech he said: “I shall not be a candidate,” and said the election, most likely in December, would be for his successor. Fifa insiders were quick to insist that he would not be standing again, despite the inevitable speculation that he might perform a U-turn given his history.</p> \n<p>He said in 2011 that his fourth term as president would be his last, only to stand again in 2015 and win, before promising to step down four days later given the maelstrom engulfing Fifa as a result of twin US and Swiss criminal investigations.</p> \n<p>The comments, and recent <a href=\"\" title=\"\">on-the -record quotes by his former adviser Klaus St&ouml;hlker</a>, are being viewed by many as an attempt to destabilise his opponents, including the Uefa president, Michel Platini.</p> \n<p>St&ouml;hlker, an adviser to Blatter during his re-election campaign, told the Guardian that Blatter would reconsider “if there was no other viable candidate” and that if he stood he would win.</p> \n<p>The Fifa executive committee will meet on 20 July to decide a date for the extraordinary congress in what is expected to be the latest staging post in the politicking that has followed the dramatic events of late May, when 14 officials were charged in the US with a “World Cup of fraud” on counts of money-laundering, racketeering and fraud.</p> \n<p>Fifa has yet to confirm whether Blatter and his secretary general, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Valcke, under pressure over what he knew about a $10m payment from South Africa to the Caribbean via Fifa that US investigators alleged was a bribe, would travel to Canada for the Women’s World Cup final, which takes place a week on Sunday.
