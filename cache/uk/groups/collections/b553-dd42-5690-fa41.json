There is Michael Carrick, of course, who has that same experience and knowledge. When he was not playing last season, we saw that United were not the same team.</p> \n<p>“Schweinsteiger is absolutely top drawer and his record and reputation speak for themselves. He is the kind of player that can lead United back to the very top.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436718356119/Bastian-Schweinsteiger-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Bayern Munich's Bastian Schweinsteiger said an emotional farewell to the club's fans in a video and statement posted on Twitter.

The 31-year-old has been offered a three-year contract worth around &pound;240,000 a week to end his three-season association with United following a &pound;24m switch from Arsenal in 2012.</p> \n<p>There is optimism at United that Schweinsteiger’s eye-catching arrival from Bayern Munich can still be followed by the signing of Morgan Schneiderlin of Southampton as Louis van Gaal continues to reshape his squad this summer. An initial bid of &pound;20m was rejected, falling at least &pound;7m short of the south-coast club’s valuation, but the Southampton manager, Ronald Koeman, has admitted he is planning for life without the France international.</p> \n<p>Schweinsteiger flew to Manchester on Sunday to undertake a medical and sign a three-year contract after bidding farewell to Bayern’s fans in a statement and video posted on Twitter. “The decision was very hard to make because you and FCB have and always will be an extremely important part of my life,” said the 30-year-old, who won eight Bundesliga titles, seven German Cups and the Champions League in a 17-year career in Bavaria. “Nevertheless, I would like to again gain experience at a new club.

The 35-year-old will add the A-League to his long international and Premier League career after signing a one-year deal with John van ’t Schip’s side.</p> \n<p>Hughes said former Newcastle United team-mate Damien Duff, who impressed in his stint with City last season, put the club on his radar. “He pretty much said if I didn’t do it, he would never speak to me again,” Hughes laughed. “It’s a great opportunity to go and try something new ... it was an easy decision in the end to come here and bring my family here as well.”</p> \n<p>The signing is unlikely to impress fans seeking a big-name glamour signing similar to those enjoyed by sister club New York City FC, such as superstars David Villa, Frank Lampard and Andrea Pirlo. But the Ulsterman, who played with English Championship outfit Brighton and Hove Albion last season, brings experience and versatility to City’s defence.</p> \n<p>Van ’t Schip said Hughes’s ability to play in each position across the back four makes him a terrific asset for the coming A-League campaign. “Aaron is an extremely experienced professional and is an excellent addition to our squad,” he said. “He brings with him a vast amount of Premier League and international experience which will be of great benefit to the team and his qualities will greatly strengthen our defence.”</p> \n<p>Hughes still features at international level for Northern Ireland, playing most recently last month in a friendly with Qatar. Northern Ireland, ranked 37 in the world, are on track to qualify for their first European Championship and Hughes suggested he would continue his international commitments.</p> \n<p>“We find ourselves in a really good position where we find ourselves in a qualification place,” he said. “We’re hoping it’s our turn now and we can push and make the Euro ... the confidence in the squad at the moment is huge.”</p> \n<p>Hughes is City’s fifth signing in the off-season and joins Socceroo Ivan Franjic as major defensive acquisitions since their semi-final finish in May.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/1df2b62280f11864e1e2342a9797b0ceab22e231/0_114_2348_1408/2348.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1408,"width":2348,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bogdan Maran/AP","altText":"Aaron Hughes tussles with Angel Rangel of Swansea during the North Irishman’s time with Fulham.

He made his debut for Los Angeles Galaxy in a home friendly in which most of the local fans treated the Galaxy as if they were the visitors.</p> \n<p>Mexico City’s Club Am&eacute;rica provided the opposition and had the majority of fans in a packed crowd of 27,934 at the StubHub Center during the home side’s 2-1 victory in the International Champions Cup. Some sat on a grassy knoll underneath the stadium’s huge video screen, while several hundred others, clad in Club Am&eacute;rica’s yellow home jerseys, filled the north-east corner of the stands behind a sign that read, “La Que Manda En 2 Paises”. The English colloquial translation is: “We rule in two countries.”</p> \n<p>Those fans – part of California’s vast population of Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans – overwhelmed the Galaxy’s support. They loudly cheered, chanted and sang in Spanish and even ignited a couple of flares in Club Am&eacute;rica’s colours.</p> \n<p>Into this atmosphere stepped Gerrard, who started to the left of Juninho in the centre of the Galaxy’s midfield and played only the first half.</p> \n<p>On some occasions the former Liverpool captain’s decision-making looked a little slow after a break from competitive football. In the 11th and 42nd minutes Gerrard reacted late when receiving simple passes. In the 18th minute he failed to secure a clearance from a team-mate near the Galaxy goal, which allowed Club Am&eacute;rica to pounce on the loose ball.</p> \n<p>“Physically it was tough,” Gerrard said. “I haven’t played a competitive match for six or seven weeks, so it was very important that I got out there and got 45 minutes.”</p> \n<p>Yet at other times Gerrard demonstrated the quality that made him one of the world’s best players. In the sixth minute he delivered a well-weighted diagonal ball to the defender Dan Gargan on the right flank. A minute later Gerrard’s dangerous lofted ball forced the Club Am&eacute;rica goalkeeper, Hugo Gonz&aacute;lez, to punch the ball away .</p> \n<p>“He’s a very dangerous passer, as you can see,” Galaxy’s AJ DeLaGarza said. “A few times we kind of stuck him in bad positions. But he got out of most of them.”</p> \n<p>Then in the 22nd minute he received Jose Villarreal’s backheel and fired off a shot that was blocked by a defender.</p> \n<p>“Steven played well,” the Galaxy coach, Bruce Arena, said. “His passing was very good. His partnership with Juninho was good. He won some tackles, helped create some opportunities. He could’ve had a goal. “His first time out was very encouraging. He looked like he belonged.”</p> \n<p>Nevertheless, Gerrard would need “probably a month” to reach match fitness, Arena said. “We’ll try to build him into that slowly. But from what I could see it was a good 45 minutes from him.”</p> \n<p>For Gerrard, progress is just a matter of time. “I’ll keep getting better and better,” he said. “The more I get used to my team-mates, I’ll improve.”</p> \n<p>As the Galaxy players were finishing their interviews, the yellow-clad denizens of the StubHub Center’s north-east corner continued singing and chanting to a drumbeat. For them Steven Gerrard might just as well have been an apparition.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/10/frank-lampard-debut-new-york-city-fc-leg-injury-mls\">Frank Lampard’s debut for New York City FC delayed by leg injury</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/12/1436699297160/Steven-Gerrard-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Steven Gerrard almost scored in his 45 minute debut appearance for LA Galaxy against Club América.
