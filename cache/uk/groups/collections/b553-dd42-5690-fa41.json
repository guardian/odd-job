The Portland Thorns striker – the sole member of England’s squad domiciled abroad – underwent knee surgery eight weeks ago and has been nursed back to fitness in the hope of assuming a central role in the knockout phase.</p> \n<p>Taylor, a forward that Norway will not be keen to see on the pitch here on Monday, made her World Cup debut as a late substitute in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/england-colombia-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">last Wednesday’s 2-1 win over Colombia</a> and very nearly scored. “It was amazing,” she says. “I really enjoyed it. I might have got a goal when I went through just after I’d come on, but the keeper clipped me at the last minute.</p> \n<p>“I had a bit of a setback after the surgery on my knee, so I’m just delighted I made it back in time. The staff at St George’s Park were great; they sped up my rehab and it was so reassuring that Mark still believed in me, and selected me for the squad.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/20/england-mark-sampson-women-world-cup\">England’s Mark Sampson ready to start fun part of Women’s World Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The injury struck out of the blue and at what appeared to be the worst possible time. Right up until the day England checked in at Heathrow for their transatlantic flight the 29-year-old was touch and go. “I got it in training, in Portland, on a Wednesday, but not through contact,” says Taylor.</p> \n<p>“The knee just turned – I felt it go. Portland got me in, two days later, for the op, then the following weekend I flew home. From the start of May I was at St George’s Park pretty much the whole time before we flew out here for the World Cup.</p> \n<p>“I was in full-time rehab for a couple of weeks before the team came into camp, and even when the players were there I was around them, but still doing my rehab. It was a relief I was able to fly to Canada with the squad. It could easily have gone the other way. But now training’s going really well, I’m getting sharper with every session. I’m definitely ready for matches.”</p> \n<p>The Merseysider had been due to make her bow from the bench as a second-half substitute during <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/england-mexico-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">last Saturday’s 2-1 win over Mexico</a>, but her knee swelled up during a half-time warm up. “It was probably partly a reaction from the training I’ve been doing, taking on increasing loads,” she says. “I did the pre-match warm-up, then I was sitting down for a while and then went back out at half-time to warm up.</p> \n<p>“It just didn’t feel right. The doctor took a look and, as desperate as I was to play, you’ve got to know your limits. Fortunately, we think the swelling was just a one off, but against Colombia I didn’t do the pre-match warm-up – I just started mine at half-time.”</p> \n<p>Taylor’s increasing trust in her knee is mirrored by a staunch belief in England’s prospects and Sampson’s radical rotation policy. “We’ve grown into the tournament and Colombia was a big win for us,” says the striker, who has played in Australia and Sweden, as well as in the United States, where she has also served as an assistant coach.</p> \n<p>“We’re getting better and better. We don’t want to peak too early, but we keep progressing and hitting the&nbsp;targets we’ve set. A lot of players have now got minutes, and that’s key in&nbsp;a tournament. In my opinion you can’t play the same 11 or 12 players in five or six matches – that won’t get you to the final.”</p> \n<p>On the subject of England potentially dominating that denouement in Vancouver on 5 July, she is unequivocal. “100%, yes,” says Taylor. “I believe we can win the World Cup.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434813375447/Jodie-Taylor-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England striker Jodie Taylor carries the ball upfield during her first appearance at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, in the 2-1 win over Colombia.

It was a good topic for discussion. We’re confident in what we can do and know what we can do.”</p> \n<p>Southgate will be without his backup up goalkeeper Jonathan Bond after the Watford player rolled his foot in training. He joins John Stones, who has concussion, on the sidelines, while Saido Berahino has gone home with a knee injury.

We’re an attacking team, we’re one of the top scorers in qualifying and that was our first game in 18 we didn’t score. We’re not going to rip up everything we’ve been doing after one defeat.”</p> \n<p>Southgate also dismissed claims that England’s representative sides are divided along racial lines after a picture was published showing members of the England Under-20s squad eating at two separate tables, one populated by black players and the other by white. “It’s quite clear from my experience of England junior teams that there is no issue,’’ said Southgate. “It was a picture that was unrepresentative of what goes on in our development teams. Anyone who’s seen this [Under-21] group of players and staff mix over the last two years or who’s been around the hotel or around the training ground for the last two weeks will see the realities of the situation.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434826671320/Under-21-European-Champio-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Gareth Southgate hopes the criticisms of his team will inspire them against Sweden on Sunday.

Then the reality is, all along we’ve said we need five points to get out of the group – that’s still achievable.</p> \n<p>“Friday didn’t need to be about football; it was about getting a sense of calm back in it because I’ve been involved in tournaments where that first defeat sets everything off kilter, and some teams are not even mentally prepared to play the second game.”</p> \n<p>Those challenges are more acute now than when Southgate was a player. Internal doubts can be managed, but external criticism in the social-media age is not so easy to curtail. Southgate is happy to confront the issue with his players – “You are better to talk about it and have it on the table than to avoid it and I suppose we have to prepare the players for what that is going to look like when they go into the senior team” – and while he cannot completely shield the squad from those who wield keyboards and smartphones as weapons, it is an issue about which he is concerned.</p> \n<p>“I go back to what I say to my daughter,” he said. “Home is a place for young people where, for the majority, there is safety and security. Now, with social media, you can be attacked in your own home. That, as a dad, bothers me because I don’t think that’s healthy and I think it is dangerous for young people, but I also move with the times and accept that we embrace social media. For young people, there’s a lot of negativity or adverse things that can come into that.”</p> \n<p>It is tempting to see Sunday’s game as a clash of philosophies: Sweden boast 11 full internationals in their 23-man squad, the most in this tournament, while England’s policy of not including those who are established in the senior side means they have brought five, with only three available on Sunday after the injuries to Berahino and Stones.</p> \n<p>In even greater contrast, England’s final opponents, Italy, have no senior internationals in their squad. On the surface it suggests not everyone is following the same development blueprint – that each country’s approach to their youth teams means the tournament takes place on a self-created uneven playing field. But the countries’ ideas are not that far apart – there has been no drafting in of established stars to the Swedish ranks.</p> \n<p>“We picked five or six seniors – if you take Luke Shaw, three were not available for selection [against Portugal],” said Southgate. “Put those into the starting lineup with Harry Kane and Jack Butland, who have also played seniors, then it is not far off what other teams have done. I don’t think anyone has played players who have not been involved in their qualifying campaigns. The only one for us who would come into that category is Raheem [Sterling].”</p> \n<p>Presenting perhaps a greater challenge for the head coach is England’s avowed aim of a more technical style throughout their development programme. “It’s an interesting balance because at the moment we’re being judged as a first team, yet we’re committed to playing a certain way through our junior teams,” said Southgate.</p> \n<p>“Watching Sweden and Portugal, they didn’t hesitate to go long from the back. I don’t say we’re under pressure, but there’s a requirement to play a certain way and develop players and win at the moment. So getting that balance is interesting, but we are committed to doing that, and I think that’s the right thing for the individual players because, if we just kick, then how do we ever know if Nathaniel Chalobah, Tom Carroll, James Ward-Prowse or Will Hughes can use the ball in tight areas and progress as individuals. So we have to stick with that.”</p> \n<p>Southgate will not, though, be sticking to the same XI that took to the field against the Portuguese “partly because of physical freshness, partly because there are a couple of positions where we think we can cause Sweden some problems”.</p> \n<p>Changes for Sweden, whose preferred 4-4-2 formation should allow England’s midfield greater freedom than it was afforded by Portugal, have been planned since before the tournament kicked off. Danny Ings, Hughes and Alex Pritchard are pushing for starting places in the midfield three that will line up behind Kane. Jesse Lingard and Carroll’s places seem most at threat.</p> \n<p>At the other end, the central defenders Ben Gibson and Liam Moore will have to contend with the threat of John Guidetti, the striker who briefly looked on course for a fruitful career at Manchester City after a prolific loan spell with Feyenoord in 2011-12. His City contract ran out this summer and he is available on a free. “I am on a Bosman – a cheeseburger costs more than me,” was his appraisal when asked to compare his value to that of Kane.</p> \n<p>His role in Sweden’s opening game against Italy was that of battering ram, chief cheerleader and goalscorer – his equaliser starting a surprise comeback completed by Isaac Kiese Thelin’s penalty. Another win for them could send England home and their head coach, Hakan Ericson, is confident, though he refused to comment on his defender Ludwig Augustinsson’s suggestion that England are “a little over-rated”. “We have found some weaknesses, but we will keep it in the group until tomorrow,” he said.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434820995254/Gareth-Southgate-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England Under-21 coach Gareth Southgate shares a joke with Nathan Redmond during a press conference ahead of the European Championship game against Sweden.

Or maybe more right than he realised: he was, they said, living in a fantasy land. But by the end of the season they all were. The manager some hoped to drive out of the city ended up being driven round it on board an open-top bus with the league, the Copa del Rey and the European Cup, supporters chanting for him to stay. The man that could never, ever match Pep Guardiola had matched Pep Guardiola and, for the second time in six years, Barcelona had won the treble – a feat unmatched by any other team, ever.</p> \n<p>Barcelona have won five of the past seven league titles and four of the past 10 European Cups but <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/18/barcelona-la-liga-champions-sid-lowe\">no one expected this</a>. Luis Enrique’s comment came just before Christmas, at a time when Real Madrid were busy claiming the Club World Cup in Morocco and taking their winning run to 22 consecutive games. And although Madrid returned and lost to Valencia at the start of the new year, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jan/05/real-madrids-run-ends-while-barcelona-shoot-themselves-in-the-foot\">Barcelona also came back to be beaten</a>. A 1-0 defeat at Real Sociedad provoked a crisis that led to elections being called and the sporting director being sacked. It <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/04/barcelona-luis-enrique-proved-cricitcs-wrong\">might have led to Luis Enrique</a> being sacked too: one poll had 68% of fans saying that they would get rid of him.</p> \n<p>Instead, as the season ended it was Carlo Ancelotti who was booted out. Exactly a year after he had finally won the <em>d&eacute;cima</em>, the club’s 10th European Cup and the trophy that obsessed and eluded Madrid for over a decade, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/14/carlo-ancelotti-real-madrid-coach-champions-league\">he was gone</a>. Barely a few months had passed since they had talked about him as Madrid’s Alex Ferguson, the man who would oversee a long dynasty. President Florentino P&eacute;rez was asked why he had sacked Ancelotti, the ninth manager he had hired and only the second to win anything. “I don’t know,” he replied.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/barcelona-extend-luis-enrique-contract\">Barcelona extend Luis Enrique’s contract until end of 2016-17</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>This was a season that was marked by the death of Jimmy Romero, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/dec/01/death-jimmy-romero-spanish-football-violence\">Deportivo de La Coru&ntilde;a fan murdered</a> before his team’s game against Atl&eacute;tico at the Calder&oacute;n, a death that brought with it a criminalisation of football fans and a dangerous false equivalency between chanting things and killing people. It was marked too by the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/17/spain-finally-fighting-match-fixing\">investigation into match-fixing</a> and the hope that, at long last, something might actually be done, as well as by the power struggle between the league and the federation, culminating in a law that regulates collective TV rights but is in fact a whole new constitution and a whole new order for the game in Spain.</p> \n<p>It was a season that had started with Atl&eacute;tico finally getting the trophy that they had won at the end of the previous campaign – 105 days later and long after Diego Costa, Thibault Courtois, Filipe Luis and David Villa had departed. Briefly, there was the hope that they could compete for the title again. Not just them, in fact. In week nine, the table read: Barcelona 22 points, Sevilla 22, Real Madrid 21, Valencia 20, Atl&eacute;tico 20. “It won’t last beyond February; for now they’re just points,” said Diego Simeone, the killjoy. He’d said much the same last season but this time he was right. Barcelona finished two points clear of Real Madrid and 16 points clear of Atl&eacute;tico.</p> \n<p>And yet this did feel like a competitive season, with victories harder to come by for the big two. Atl&eacute;tico beat Real twice, including <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/feb/09/atletico-real-madrid-diego-simeone-la-liga\">a 4-0 win at home</a>, their best derby result since 1947, and they, Valencia and Sevilla all made the duopoly suffer, playing like genuinely good teams. All three qualified for the Champions League too and they, like Athletic Bilbao and Villarreal who head into the Europa League, will compete next season. Sevilla beat Dnipro in the Europa League final in Warsaw, Barcelona won in Berlin, and in 32 two-leg European games or one-off finals against non-Spanish teams, Spanish teams have prevailed 30 times.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3ed57206e7eb34e0a1bc92ccd6088c916b758be\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434643112342/1f08bbe2-24ae-40cb-81c6-ea73f504b265-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Atl&eacute;tico Madrid's Tiago celebrates after scoring in the 4-0 victory over Real Madrid in February.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Atl&eacute;tico Madrid’s Tiago, right, celebrates after scoring in the 4-0 victory over Real Madrid in February.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sergio Perez/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Domestically, the teams that departed the first division were C&oacute;rdoba, who went straight back down <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/sep/01/arcangel-la-liga-return-cordoba\">after 42 years away</a>, and UD Almer&iacute;a. In the second division, they’ll be joined by Real Oviedo, back from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2012/nov/29/real-oviedo-spain-premier-league\">the brink of disappearance</a> and <a href=\"http://as.com/diarioas/2015/05/31/english/1433102375_097666.html\">back in professional football</a> for the first time in 12 years. In the first division, they will be replaced by Real Betis and Sporting Gij&oacute;n, for whom promotion means survival. They’ll be joined by the winner of the play-off between Zaragoza and Las Palmas, which Zaragoza lead 3-1 after the first leg.</p> \n<p>The way the second division ended was especially insane, with the final promotion and relegation places both settled in the last minute of the last game. Osasuna survived with a last-minute goal and at the other end of the table Sporting’s players found out that they had gone up while on the pitch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbyfSJTG0wQ\">applauding their disappointed fans</a> but it <em>still</em> wasn’t over. Up in Girona, Lugo scored in the last minute and then the teams had gone off after a bottle hit a linesman, only to be <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw0YCcXCewA\">dragged back out to play the final 40 seconds</a>, 20 long minutes later ... after they had got showered and changed and with the manager in the middle of the press conference.</p> \n<p>So Girona, on course for the first division, stayed in the second division, where they’ll be joined by C&oacute;rdoba and Almer&iacute;a. They were supposed to be joined by Eibar, relegated at the end of their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/aug/25/eibar-la-liga-fairytale-introduction\">first season in <em>primera</em></a>. But with Elche demoted because of debts to players and the taxman, the Basque side are in line to be reinstated. When? Well, with legal battles to come, that’s another question. Too late to keep hold of manager Gaizka Garitano, though, who resigned because he had been unable to keep them up.</p> \n<p>It wasn’t quite as dramatic as in the second division but <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/may/25/eibar-relegation-la-liga-sid-lowe\">Eibar were relegated </a>on the final day, while Granada and Deportivo survived, although the league say they will investigate Depor centre-back Alberto Lopo’s on-field request that Barcelona’s players go easy. The Galicians joined Barcelona in celebrating at the Camp Nou on the final day, coming from 2-0 down to draw 2-2. It ended up being a party for them and the first of three parties for the Catalan club, who had <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/17/atletico-madrid-barcelona-la-liga-match-report\">won the league in Madrid </a>the weekend before.</p> \n<p>For the most important player in Spain’s footballing history it was a fitting finale and the photo of him and Andrea Pirlo embracing is particularly poignant. The last three weekends of Xavi Hern&aacute;ndez’s career in Europe, his 898th, 899th and 900th games, all ended in the same way: with him lifting a trophy. On Saturday May 23, it was the league trophy; the following Saturday <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/30/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-copa-del-rey-final-match-report\">it was the Copa del Rey</a>, and the Saturday after that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/06/barcelona-luis-suarez-lionel-messi-juventus-champions-league-final\">it was the European Cup</a>. No one has ever lifted as many here. This season he and Barcelona had left nothing for anyone else.</p> \n<p>Well, not “nothing”, exactly ... And, let’s face it, the real winner was the Colombian singer Kevin Roldan, who couldn’t have got greater publicity if he had actually <em>asked</em> Cristiano Ronaldo and Gerard Piqu&eacute; to advertise his latest, god-awful record. It started with Roldan, Piqu&eacute; joked during the treble celebrations. It didn’t. It started way before that and he wasn’t the only winner. Even C&oacute;rdoba don’t go away empty-handed. Nor, of course, do Rayo Vallecano, stars of this season’s very best moment ...</p> \n<h2>Best story<br /></h2> \n<p>Carmen Mart&iacute;nez Ayudo is 85, she’s a widow, and she lives in a small flat on Calle Sierra de Palomeras in the working-class neighbourhood of Vallecas, to the east of Madrid, just as she has done for the last 50 years. Or at least she did until the bailiffs came to evict her, with the help of a load of policemen, after her son defaulted on €40,000 that, unbeknownst to her, he’d secured on her home via a local loan shark. So it was that Carmen was out on the street, until a group of men came to her rescue. Those men are footballers and they play for Rayo Vallecano, coach Paco J&eacute;mez leading them into finding a new flat for Carmen, paying her rent and paying regular visits ever since. “We couldn’t just stand there,” J&eacute;mez said.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-7ea71e5b-8948-471d-8fff-2e3f2de68ee0\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434723465430/52eb9c58-1dd6-4643-8971-c8c4660efa84-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Carmen Mart&iacute;nez Ayudo, who was evicted from her flat and then rehomed by Rayo Vallecano players.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Carmen Mart&iacute;nez Ayudo, who was evicted from her flat and then rehomed by Rayo Vallecano players.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andres Kudacki/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Best banners<br /></h2> \n<p>The following morning Rayo, a club whose fans have long had a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2012/feb/27/ray-vallecano-la-liga-blog\">left-wing identity tied to the neighbourhood</a>, and where protest is an art form, fans going dressed in Guatanamo orange this year to complain about the increasing and unjustified criminalisation of fans, they faced Celta de Vigo. Banners were hung all round the three-sided ground. “Carmen Stays”, said one. “The pride of a neighbourhood”, said another. At the end, another declared: “The evictions of a sick state/the solidarity of a working-class neighbourhood.”</p> \n<h2>Best protest<br /></h2> \n<p>It’s hard to decide who to choose in a season in which the league, the federation and the players’ union threatened to go on strike. In fact, the only people who didn’t threaten to strike this season were the people who would have been most right to: the fans.</p> \n<h2>Worst chant<br /></h2> \n<p>And it’s a serious one this time. The <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/dec/01/death-jimmy-romero-spanish-football-violence\">killing of Jimmy Romero </a>led, perhaps inevitably, to a crackdown on fan behaviour and the beginnings of a process in which they were criminalised for chanting, with official reports heading to the police and weekly lists of supposedly offensive songs usually making comic and frankly ridiculous reading, with supporters denounced for such terrible taunts as “clown”. There was one that stood out for being genuinely horrible, though. The striker Rub&eacute;n Castro was due in court charged with domestic abuse, relating to alleged treatment of a former girlfriend, but Betis’s fans still supported him, singing a song that described the alleged victim as a “whore” and reassured him that he had done “the right thing”. Castro has denied domestic abuse and the case is due in court. All this leads us to ...</p> \n<h2>Worst headline</h2> \n<p>When Rub&eacute;n Castro scored a hat-trick soon after, La Raz&oacute;n ran with: “Castro abuses Valladolid.” Just let that sink in for a moment.</p> \n<h2>Most harmonious relationship<br /></h2> \n<p>The LFP and the RFEF, of course, the bickering pair that couldn’t even agree on how the league table looked, Almer&iacute;a going into the final weeks in the relegation zone according to the RFEF and out of the relegation zone according to the LFP. This was the season in which Javier Tebas, the president of the league, wrote a letter to &Aacute;ngel Mar&iacute;a Villar, the president of the federation, complaining that he had called him a “dickhead” in one meeting; the year he publicly accused Villar of being “irresponsible”, “harmful” and acting like “a feudal lord with his castle and his court”; and the year in which he then led the way to <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/spanish-primera-division/15/blog/post/2450892/spanish-football-la-liga-strike-explained-by-sid-lowe\">a new law </a>that was effectively a palace coup that left the RFEF bemoaning the fact that they had been “run over”. Still, Villar got his own back – by not inviting Tebas to the Spanish Cup final. “I shudder to think whose hands Spanish football is in,” Tebas said. Well, quite.</p> \n<h2>Best neighbours<br /></h2> \n<p>&Aacute;lvaro Arbeloa claimed that Diego Simeone was fortunate to have the press on side – unlike, erm, Real Madrid – prompting the Atl&eacute;tico manager to reply: “I don’t know what he’s talking about, but we’re neighbours so next time I see him out walking the dogs I’ll ask …” “His dogs are quite a bit bigger than mine and we haven’t crossed paths yet this week, but thankfully I have no problems with him,” Arbeloa responded. “If he needs eggs and salt, he knows where my house is.” And so it was that when they met in the derby a few days later, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/marca/status/563838592225931264\">Marca ran on an ingenious and slightly bizarre picture</a> of eggs and salt and the headline: “<em>Sal con huevos</em>”, which means “salt with eggs” and also, handily, means “go out there and show you have balls”. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/feb/09/atletico-real-madrid-diego-simeone-la-liga\">Atl&eacute;tico did, Real did not</a>.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"631198f7ec31388ce3c1e8056a645bb7839ee0fc\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434644493501/afcaad7b-f780-4baf-a453-eafc6e25b00b-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Atl&eacute;tico Madrid coach, Diego Simeone, whose dogs were revealed to be bigger than those owned by &Aacute;lvaro Arbeloa.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Atl&eacute;tico Madrid coach, Diego Simeone, whose dogs were revealed to be bigger than those owned by &Aacute;lvaro Arbeloa.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Frank Augstein/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Weirdest front cover<br /></h2> \n<p>That was weird, this was weirder. They actually did it. And they actually admitted to doing it, too. Not just admitted, in fact, but gloried in it. On the front page of a national newspaper. Yes, AS really did splash a ouija board session on its cover on the morning of Real Madrid’s Copa del Rey clash against Atl&eacute;tico. They <a href=\"http://as.com/videos/2015/01/14/portada/1421275799_856726.html\">even produced a video of it</a>, just in case you doubted just how unhinged they are. In it, mad Madridista Tom&aacute;s Roncero and some equally mad mates called upon the former attacker Juanito, killed in a car crash in 1992, to help them from beyond the grave as they sought another famous comeback. (Of which, incidentally, for all the talk, there have been none in two decades now.) “Are you there Juanito?” they asked. “Yes,” Juanito replied. “Can you give us a score?” they asked. “Three-nil,” Juanito said. Three-nil, eh? Hmm, that went well. Less than a minute into the game, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jan/15/fernando-torres-atletico-real-madrid-copa-del-rey\">Fernando Torres had scored</a> and the “prediction” was in tatters. Much like their reputation, in fact.</p> \n<h2>Weirdest sight<br /></h2> \n<p>Talking of weird, here’s Fabi&aacute;n <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsPNXO4PhZ8\">Orellana attacking Sergio Busquets</a> ... with a clump of grass. And Arda Turan <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7EgVWlyqhQ\">throwing one of his boots</a> at the linesman.</p> \n<h2>Most merciless hype<br /></h2> \n<p>The <em>cl&aacute;sico</em>, of course. There were just the 32 pages of buildup in Marca before the second <em>cl&aacute;sico</em>, most of it with all the substance of a pot noodle. Sport ran a series of articles with a handwriting expert who, surprise, surprise, decided that Ronaldo’s signature proves he displays “false humility, egocentrism and sensitivity to criticism”, the evil bastard. Messi’s writing meanwhile proves that he’s lovely. AS did the inevitable players’ wives video, asking: “Who wins?” And there was even a double page spread dedicated to what a load of chefs thought. Just in case you didn’t think the hype was overcooked already, like.</p> \n<h2>Most contrived link to football<br /></h2> \n<p>More contrived even than the ladies that grace the back of AS daily, with their tenuous connection to the game and even more tenuous connection to clothing, was <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/608220073824813056\">this advert </a>which encouraged you to “score a goal on your table” with Montsi&aacute; rice: “the perfect play for any situation.” They couldn’t even be bothered to come up with a goalkeeper, defender or striker, but that didn’t stop them proudly proclaiming Montsi&aacute; a “great team” where “Bomba and Basmati play in midfield” and “paella is on the wings” so that you can build the “best move in the kitchen”.</p> \n<h2>Best merchandise<br /></h2> \n<p>Staying in the kitchen, the sports dailies hawked kitted-out kitchen knives, footballing frying pans, and toasters that burn the badge on to your bread. But this time, the winner is actually a shirt. Real Madrid’s third shirt, in fact. The one with the dragon on it; a dragon that “symbolises the greatestness, glory and power of the club”, its “resistance, determination and agility on the way to victory”. Or so they said. That was one reading; another could be that it symbolises the dragon Saint George slayed. You know, Saint George: patron saint of Catalonia, the knight whose cross adorns Barcelona’s badge.</p> \n<h2>Best half-time entertainment<br /></h2> \n<p>Jes&uacute;s proposing to Esther on the pitch at Mestalla – a moment made all the more tender by the great big cuddly bat standing there with his huge foam head and a tear in his goggly acrylic eyes. And by Valencia winning of course, not least due to Pablo Sarabia wasting a great chance for Getafe. “Thank God he missed that,” Jes&uacute;s said afterwards, as if a goal there would have ruined the entire day.</p> \n<h2>Best post-match entertainment <br /></h2> \n<p>Getafe may just be the most realistic club in La Liga, the only first division team with no followers on Twitter and no Twitter at all and the club whose website carries a box that says “get your tickets here”; a box that when you click on it, takes you to a new page ... which is empty. The club, too, whose scoreboard at the Coliseum Alfonso P&eacute;rez carries six sponsors: one DYI shop, three car showrooms, one soft drink. And a brothel.</p> \n<h2>Best entertainer<br /></h2> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.espnfc.com/club/barcelona/83/blog/post/2480180/dani-alves-leaves-barcelona-cause-for-regret-sid-lowe\">Dani Alves</a> show was an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKcQTvlo_Rc\">all-singing, all-dancing extravaganza</a>, but the winner has to be <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/08/david-moyes-real-sociedad-sid-lowe\">David Moyes</a> – even if there’s something just a little bit wrong about turning up in a city with more Michelin stars per miles than anywhere in Europe and ending up dining out on the time you <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJj_9CPZTXo\">dined out on a packet of Wotsits</a>. When he was sent off against Villarreal for performing the universal gesture for “you need glasses, pal”, Moyes hopped into the crowd, winked at the fans and sat to watch the rest of the game. There, a fan offered him a few crisps and he gratefully tucked in, offering a little thumbs up. Another offering was soon thrust his way but this time it was a bag of Mr Corn and this time he turned them down. That would be going too far.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00528d28c1fd695582eaaed4853fe2594522ca1e\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434644730165/3fa93f87-b5d4-4f72-b458-70fc7587c1d7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"David Moyes, the Real Sociedad manager, provided entertainment by taking crisps from a fan after being sent off.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Moyes, the Real Sociedad manager, provided entertainment by taking crisps from a fan after being sent off.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: SUSANA VERA/SUSANA VERA/Reuters/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Most lovable footballer</h2> \n<p>Think it’s possible not to love Celta striker Nolito? Read this: “I go and watch kids play and I see parents shouting at them and I think: ‘Leave your kid alone. You think he’s Maradona. They’re there to enjoy themselves. You’re demanding 20 goals and four overhead kicks.’” Still not convinced? How about this: asked why he didn’t go to England despite the huge pay rise, Nolito said: “Because it’s cold, it rains a lot, and the food’s bad ... Besides, what do I need more money for? All greed does is rip the bag.” Still not convinced? Ok, how about this: asked about a penalty his team were denied, he replied: “Talking about referees is like asking the lemon tree for cup cakes.” Oh, and he can play a bit too. So much so that they started calling him “Celta’s Messi”. “Nah,” he said. “I’m Nolito.”</p> \n<h2>Best return<br /></h2> \n<p>Nolito is lovable, but no one is loved quite like The Kid. Fernando Torres returned to the Vicente Calder&oacute;n seven and a half years later, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jan/04/fernando-torres-atletico-madrid-warm-welcome\">the stadium filling </a>on a sunny Sunday morning. Down in the tunnel, nervously waiting for his moment, he gathered his two children Nora and Leo and gave them a last minute pep-talk. “Now, we just walk out to the middle of the pitch and wave,” he said. “And don’t suck your thumb.” Out they went and soon the crowd were cheering a Torres goal at the north end ... a Nora Torres goal, that was. Not that they had to wait long for one from Fernando: three days later he beat Real Madrid for the first time as an Atl&eacute;tico player; eight days after that he went to the Bernab&eacute;u and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jan/15/fernando-torres-atletico-real-madrid-copa-del-rey\">knocked his biggest rivals out of the cup</a>, not just scoring his first ever goal there, but scoring his second ever goal there too, both coming within a minute of kick-off at the start of each half. And in the next round, against Barcelona, he scored again. It had taken him just 38 seconds again. Thirty-eight seconds and 3,000 days. No wonder he kneeled down and kissed the turf.</p> \n<h2>Purplest patch<br /></h2> \n<p>Torres’s three goals against Madrid and Barcelona, after a combined two and half minutes of the start, was good, but this patch was even purpler. In nominative determinism news, Alberto Bueno (Bertie Good in Spanish) jumped 10 places in the goalscoring charts in 14 minutes one Saturday afternoon in February, overtaking Sergio Garc&iacute;a, Artiz Aduriz and Nolito as the top-scoring Spaniard thanks to four goals for Rayo Vallecano between 6.23pm and 6.37pm, each greeted with the booming opening bars of the Final Countdown. It was the closest they got to Europe.</p> \n<h2>Best excuse<br /></h2> \n<p>Luis Enrique noted that among the reasons he had left Neymar and Leo Messi out of the trip to San Sebasti&aacute;n in January was that they had the Copa Am&eacute;rica at the end of the season. Unlike Javier Mascherano, Dani Alves and Claudio Bravo. But the best is the former Barcelona president Sandro Rosell, the man charged with tax fraud who reportedly said he doesn’t read the small print.<strong> </strong>Rosell denies wrongdoing.</p> \n<h2>Best motivator<br /></h2> \n<p>Before every game, Eibar’s coach, Gaizka Garitano, whacked his players in the chest as they ran out on to the pitch where, usually, they lost. “I’m going to have to starting hitting them harder,” he said.</p> \n<h2>Best trolling<br /></h2> \n<p>Sergio Ramos was asked after one game what he thought about Jos&eacute; Mourinho’s remarks claiming that “he is no doctor” and shouldn’t be questioning the “injuries” suffered by Chelsea’s Spain players. He replied deadpan: “Now’s not the time to talk about the Celta president.” The president’s name, for those who don’t get it, is Mouri&ntilde;o.</p> \n<p>But the winner has to be Luis Enrique after AS ran a curious cover, its headline inventing a baffling metaphor to suggest that the Barcelona’s manager was in a tricky situation, swimming against the tide. “Luis Enrique does breaststroke through chewing gum”, it declared. The reaction from most was to scratch their heads and mutter “Eh?! Chewing gum?! Wha’ choo talkin’ ’bout Willis?”; the reaction from Luis Enrique was smarter. The following morning he posted a picture of Joan Barbar&aacute; and Juan Carlos Unzu&eacute;, two members of his coaching staff, in the offices at Barcelona’s San Joan Desp&iacute; training ground. “Excitedly preparing the <em>cl&aacute;sico</em>,” ran the caption. On the desk in front of them sat a packet of chewing gum.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"815a8347484ae63edb4916c84e4fc8bef13636b9\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434644826988/b4c75b36-be04-49e8-b70c-d55e5705c1f5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Real Madrid's Sergio Ramos provided an amusing response to criticism from Jos&eacute; Mourinho.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Real Madrid’s Sergio Ramos provided an amusing response to criticism from Jos&eacute; Mourinho.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul White/AP</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Best rant<br /></h2> \n<p>It’s a one-two for C&oacute;rdoba. “After one minute it was over. There were few fouls, few bollocks, and that hurts. I feel ashamed when I see – fucking great! – that Iniesta is more aggressive than we are. That hurts. With the greatest of respect to Iniesta, we all know he has other qualities ... Barcelona scored two from dead balls against us and they don’t [score from dead balls] against anyone ... We went out there before the game to ask Barcelona’s players for their shirts. Turn off the lights, let’s get out of here. It hurts. I feel ashamed ... I am sorry and they’ll be sorry too. The players who play will be the ones with balls. I’ll go down to the second division but with warriors, with players who have the knife between their teeth. They may not have a fucking clue how to play football but they’ll have the knife between their teeth. If we don’t have the knife between our teeth, there’s nothing we can do. In this shitty life, either you’re good or you’re a warrior, but you have to have something ... I know that Barcelona is not our game but either we change things or we’re going nowhere.”</p> \n<p>C&oacute;rdoba manager Miroslav Djukic might have been getting mad but, briefly, he seemed to have got it right. C&oacute;rdoba had won just once all season and were going down when he said that following their defeat at Barcelona; three weeks later they were 14th, had picked up seven points from nine and scored the fastest goal of the season. It didn’t last, though, and a week after they had been relegated, the striker Florin Andone was not holding back, describing his team as “ridiculous” and “awful” following their game against Granada, telling a local radio station: “We haven’t even had a shot on goal. I’m awful. I can’t even play a fucking pass, and the team’s the same. I’m sick of everything, mate. It’s like we’re all here thinking about next season and we’re not even trying to rescue some dignity in these last three games. If we’re bad, we’re bad, mate, but we’ve at least got to show some fucking attitude and try. We can’t just go out there and let them laugh at us.”</p> \n<h2>Best punishment<br /></h2> \n<p>No one was laughing. And C&oacute;rdoba’s board agreed, which handily hid their own culpability, so they punished the players by making them travel to the final game of the season at Eibar, by bus – 797km away.</p> \n<h2>Best tackle<br /></h2> \n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00CRBEkfnP4&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;a\">Diogo Figueras’s determined clearance</a> against Espanyol worked out rather nicely, but this is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4t_zr36TPY\">surely the best</a> from Rayo’s Quini.</p> \n<h2>Worst refereeing decision<br /></h2> \n<p>No bookings there, plenty of bookings here. M&aacute;laga’s president, Sheikh Abdullah al-Thani, kindly offered a helping hand, tweeting: “referee If you don’t have Medical glasses. Will give you free Medical glasses.” And this is a land where every ref officially uses both surnames so that you know exactly who he is the son of when all that really matters to fans is <em>what</em> he is the son of, where every decision is pored over, stopped, started, and rewound and every referee is attributed a preference that says more about their bias than about his. But that’s not to say they’re <em>not</em> wrong, and pretty often too.</p> \n<p>The worst decision of a startlingly bad bunch belongs to Antonio Mateu Lahoz, who ruled out potentially the goal of the season, way back in week one. It was the 94th minute when Gorka Iraizoz leapt high, his back straight, and met a free-kick, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdGoFQU6Fhs\">thumping his header into the net to equalise</a>. All of which would be have been pretty good anyway but was better because Iraizoz is a goalkeeper. Alas, Mateu Lahoz disallowed the goal for ... well, no one’s really sure, not even 37 weeks later. After the game, Iraizoz and Lahoz met again and the debate went on, until it finished with Gorka shrugging: “The worst thing is it was a bloody good goal.”</p> \n<h2>Best goal<br /></h2> \n<p>It was too. And it might have won this award. But, with Gorka ruled out, someone else has to take it. There’s always something a bit special about a late goal, so Sergio Garc&iacute;a getting a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaJLgIehIwY\">103rd-minute equaliser</a> at 1.01 in the morning the following weekend takes some beating, yet all of these do beat it. Sa&uacute;l Berj&oacute;n volleyed in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znH7UndiG2I\">ridiculously good set piece</a> during Eibar’s 3-3 draw with Levante. The week before, his team-mate Abraham Minero had scored an even better goal at the Calder&oacute;n, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pErfUh3LiUI&amp;list=UUTv-XvfzLX3i4IGWAm4sbmA\">curling in a neat finish</a> to a neat move. And Eibar’s first ever goal in the first division was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWgVq95pxVg\">a beauty too</a>, from Javi Lara.</p> \n<p>Lucas P&eacute;rez’s goal against Barcelona on the final day was not just good, it was huge. “We’re playing for our lives,” he had said, desperately, and it was wonderful to see him, a local boy and Depor fan, <a href=\"http://www.canalplus.es/el-dia-despues/videos/20150524plucanftb_13\">rescue his team</a>. Chori Castro belted in two volleys for Real Sociedad, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfn8x-c_erY&amp;feature=youtu.be\">against Deportivo</a> in week 31 and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0xlM3Fw8XA\">Rayo six weeks later</a>. Granada’s Rub&eacute;n Rochina won the ball and scored from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMxGDVuXvmQ\">just inside the opposition half</a> at Anoeta. And Real Oviedo’s Miguel Linares, top scorer in Spain’s 80-team Second Division B, went one better by scoring <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealOviedoWFC/status/523892418740256768\">from inside his own half</a> to complete a hat-trick. (He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RealOviedoWFC/status/503683464848502784\">also scored this</a>, beautifully made by H&eacute;ctor Font).</p> \n<p>James Rodr&iacute;guez scored goal after brilliant goal, the best of which was probably <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=St4yqSiGoF0&amp;feature=youtu.be\">the one at Granada</a> or the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBOakCX-W2g&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;a\">move against M&aacute;laga</a>. You don’t realise how good <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qDTU6zEp8O0\">Toni Kroos’s finish against Rayo</a> is until you see it from behind the goal, the shot curving back inside the post like bowling ball spinning along a varnished lane. If its headers you want, then <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amqjsCZvncM\">Ronaldo at Deportivo</a> was almost as good as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O7u5CfdcWw&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLKj1QUtwqLN_u2YK9OYfbdJ1Cur6juBha\">Aduriz against Real Madrid</a>. And as a reflection of Barcelona’s front three, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dbMxfcpkAcI\">Neymar’s goal against Atl&eacute;tico</a> in the Copa del Rey takes some beating, while <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMsDdjeD76g\">Su&aacute;rez’s against Villarreal</a> was impressive too.</p> \n<p>The very best really has to be Leo Messi, though. You could pick one of a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHcsMHaLWJc\">dozen ludicrous goals</a> but the one that stands out above all is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bOX2QpfMkq4\">the opener in the Copa del Rey final</a> against Athletic. One question still lingers: <em>how?</em></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58ea0eb9e5697389429f49e97546d728c5916973\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434644974028/d68b5ef7-5b02-4588-a67f-5546cc1532e5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Lionel Messi scored a wonder-goal for Barcelona against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lionel Messi scored a wonder-goal for Barcelona against Athletic Bilbao in the Copa del Rey final.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andreu Dalmau/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Best goal celebration<br /></h2> \n<p>On the weekend that Catalonia voted in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/nov/10/barcelona-espanyol-catalonia-independence\">an illegal “referendum”</a>, one Catalan player celebrated with a T-shirt under his shirt saying: “Today’s goal is for you, [Spanish PM Mariano] Rajoy.” <a href=\"http://orgulloso.es/ancelotti-imita-una-celebracion-de-cristiano-ronaldo-en-eibar/\">Carlo Ancelotti did a nice impression</a> of Ronaldo’s routine, arms back, chest-out, “s&iacute;-oooh” on his lips, while Ronaldo himself did a good impression of a man who really wasn’t that happy that his team had scored when <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pOHoCSy2GM\">Bale put the ball in the net</a> against Levante. And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMtU5x6QrVc\">for coolness</a> it was hard to beat <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2014/sep/15/arda-turan-atletico-madrid-real-madrid-derby-la-liga\">Arda Turan at the Bernab&eacute;u</a>. But forget all the usual choreography and planned pillockery, <em>this</em> is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_OE-_9n1iM&amp;feature=youtu.be\">how you celebrate a goal</a>. Step forward Doctor Diego Cervero Otero.</p> \n<h2>Best game<br /></h2> \n<p>Here’s a sentence you probably never expected to read: Elche-C&oacute;rdoba was pretty tasty. So was Eibar-Levante. Better than both was the night Barcelona became the first team to beat Villarreal, winning 3-2 at the Camp Nou. For madness, Atl&eacute;tico-Barcelona in the Cup had five goals, two red cards, and Turan throwing one of his boots. It was just a pity the defender Cristian Ansaldi missed it all: he turned up at the Calder&oacute;n without his ID and got carted off to the police station when an argument ensued, not getting let out until well past full-time.</p> \n<p>But if you really wanted fun this season, Sevilla were the team to watch. Their 2-2 draw with Barcelona was special and so was their 3-2 win over Espanyol in week 21, a game won 3-2 in the last minute, the scorer Iago Aspas running off screaming, tearing off his shirt. No pretence, no posing, just madness, the lid blown off at last. Aspas had made history along with Beto, Casilla, Pau and Rico: for the first time, four different goalkeepers had conceded in the same match. Better still was <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/feb/23/real-sociedad-sevilla-la-liga-david-moyes\">Sevilla’s trip to San Sebasti&aacute;n</a>, which they somehow lost 4-3 in the last minute, a game with 17 shots for each team and 19 players having a go at goal. “We’ll have to watch the DVD again to work out what happened,” Sevilla’s Timoth&eacute;e Kolodziejczak said, quite rightly.</p> \n<p>That’s in the first division, anyway. For real drama, the second division was the place to be. “I got taken off at 2-3. When I got out the shower, it was 3-5,” said Lugo’s Jonathan Valle, after a game against Numancia in December. That would have been bonkers enough but he hadn’t even missed the best bit. There were 11 minutes and four goals still to go, when he started drying off. Lugo made it 3-6, the game seemingly all over. But then Numancia made it 4-6 in the 83rd minute, 5-6 in the 90th and 6-6 in the 90th and a bit. And they still had time to almost grab a winner. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D660E3TBwG0\">It finished 6-6</a>, for the first time in <em>Segunda</em>.</p> \n<h2>Best signing<br /></h2> \n<p>Douglas. Or Cerci. Oh, alright then. It could be Luis Su&aacute;rez, even at €81m. But it’s got to be Elche’s Jonathas.</p> \n<h2>Best manager<br /></h2> \n<p>Jos&eacute; Ram&oacute;n Sandoval, the one-man tsunami who took charge of Granada with four games to go and on a one-month contract, managed as many wins in his first two matches as either of his two predecessors had managed in the previous 36, won a third and then led his team to survival with a draw against Atl&eacute;tico. Rayo surviving is so normal now that it barely warrants comment but, on the division’s smallest budget and with 18 players in and 18 players out in the summer, not one player in the squad having cost a cent in transfer fees, it remains a miracle and one that’s brilliant to watch. No one talks about Marcelino <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jan/19/villarreal-airport-la-liga-sid-lowe-roundup\">at Villarreal</a>, but they should.

Chile’s game against Bolivia on Friday began with Arturo Vidal’s name being cheered by the 45,000 fans at the Est&aacute;dio Nacional, a clear message of support after he was charged with drink-driving. It ended with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/20/chile-bolivia-5-0-copa-america\" title=\"\">Chile having won 5-0</a> after a display of exhilarating football and, to the local media at least, questions about whether Vidal should have been allowed to play on were fading before the thought that this Chile squad is probably better equipped than any other in the country’s history to win the Copa Am&eacute;rica. A wait that began in the very first continental tournament in 1916 may be about to come to an end.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/20/chile-bolivia-5-0-copa-america\">Chile 5-0 Bolivia | Copa Am&eacute;rica Group A match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Yet the expediency of Chile’s football federation, of the coach, Jorge Sampaoli, and even of Alexis S&aacute;nchez, who defended Vidal before Friday’s game, has provoked consternation. The former national team striker turned politician Leonardo V&eacute;liz, for instance, articulated what many Chileans are saying. “We are getting used to people committing wrong in all fields, above all in politics and football,” he said. “In the end they try to justify it by giving excuses as if nothing has happened.”</p> \n<p>The issue of Vidal and the tension between those who take a moral stand and those who are simply desperate for Chile to win a trophy is only one strand of intrigue in what has been an extraordinary start to the Copa Am&eacute;rica. Major tournaments tend to be defined less by the quality of their football than by the narratives they generate – as demonstrated by <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/15/italia-90-world-cup-special\" title=\"\">the nostalgia for the 25th anniversary of Italia 90</a>, a World Cup that yielded little good football and remains the lowest scoring in history – and this is a Copa already rich with stories.</p> \n<p>Chile’s dilemma over Vidal is by far the most serious, but the Juventus midfielder is not the only big star to have let himself down. Neymar’s red card for butting Jeison Murillo after the final whistle of Wednesday’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/colombia-fight-to-crucial-1-0-win-over-brazil-in-copa-america\" title=\"\">defeat to Colombia</a>, combined with his second yellow card of the tournament and a volley of abuse aimed at the referee in the tunnel, earned him <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/20/neymar-banned-four-matches-brazil-copa-america\" title=\"\">a four-game ban</a>, ending his tournament.</p> \n<p>It may be that in the absence of their overwhelming star, other Brazil forwards are liberated but so far Dunga’s side have looked shapeless and staggeringly dependent on Neymar. The pressure he was under as a result at least in part explains Neymar’s petulance and volatility. Many have protested that Neymar’s punishment seems harsh beside the free pass Chile in effect handed Vidal, but the two issues are not directly comparable. Vidal’s offence may seem clearcut but is not yet proven and, besides, an alleged driving offence does not fall under Conmebol’s jurisdiction.</p> \n<p>Argentina’s collapse in their first group game, throwing away a 2-0 lead to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/copa-america-argentinas-dominance-undone-by-late-paraguay-rally\" title=\"\">draw with Paraguay</a>, reawakened all their doubts. Lionel Messi has spoken of the “obligation” of this generation to end Argentina’s 22-year trophy drought, to turn the five Under-20 World Cups they won between 1995 and 2007 into silverware at senior level. Their drought is shorter than Chile’s, but no less keenly felt. On a personal level, there is a sense that Messi needs to consecrate his genius with international success.</p> \n<p>The performance against Uruguay, although it <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/argentina-uruguay-copa-america-match-report\" title=\"\">resulted in a win</a>, was fraught, one of a side battling with their own awareness of history – and also with the ever knotty issue of Carlos Tevez, whose popularity, political clout and tendency to sulk mean his omission from the starting lineup always creates tension.</p> \n<p>Colombia are likewise wrestling with a striker. Radamel Falcao became the country’s top scorer in the final friendly before the Copa but he struggled in the defeat by Venezuela and the win over Brazil. It is not just that his acceleration has deserted him; his limitations unbalance the side tactically.

At times it is easy to suspect the alphabet may not contain sufficient letters to embrace the England coach’s tactical alternatives. In three group games the 32-year-old has not only used his complement of 20 outfield players but fielded three starkly contrasting starting formations.</p> \n<p>Norway must be struggling to know where to begin fathoming out the Lionesses for their round of 16 game on Monday night in Ottawa. Designed to bewilder the opposition while bewitching England fans, Sampson’s kaleidoscopic array of options contradict the conventional school of thought that major tournaments are invariably won by settled sides.</p> \n<p>So far, though, Hope Powell’s successor is enjoying the benefits of creating acute competition while retaining the sort of squad camaraderie so difficult to maintain when fringe players start becoming disillusioned with permanent seats on the bench.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/england-colombia-womens-world-cup-match-report\">England women 2-1 Colombia women | Women’s World Cup match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“To be honest I hadn’t planned to use all 20 outfield players by now,” says Sampson. “It’s just happened – but in a nice way. And all the players are now physically sharp, fit, fresh and good to go.”</p> \n<p>After 18 months in charge, he is not afraid to attempt the sort of mid-game rotation of systems and personnel that many counterparts shy away from. Plus, he remains adamant an element of mystery offers England their best chance of winning here. “The longer we last in this tournament the more different Englands we’ll have to show opponents within games,” he says. “At half-time against Colombia [in last Wednesday’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/england-colombia-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">2-1 win in Montreal</a>] we switched from a team very quick on transition and very aggressive in pressing to one sitting a bit deeper, playing on the counterattack and managing the spaces.</p> \n<p>“Against the top teams, games ebb and flow. There are times for front-foot football and times where you have to be more careful and manage important spaces. The challenge is recognising when those moments come.”</p> \n<p>At first glance it can appear off-the-cuff choreography but England’s chameleon-like character is the product of painstaking drills on the training pitches and hours of tactical analysis in the classroom. “We always have a strategy,” says Sampson. “Over the last 18 months we’ve played different systems and styles to make sure we had them in the locker come tournament time. It’s great to know that we can give a signal and the players will do something different, something to pose the opposition a different problem, or solve a problem of our own.”</p> \n<p>There is a sense of things coming full circleon Monday. Sampson’s first England match was against Norway in the lower stress environs of La Manga in southern Spain and finished 1-1.</p> \n<p>“It seems about 35 years ago,” says a coach whose players will not bow out for want of mental conditioning. Big on emotional intelligence, he ensures a sports psychologist is constantly available to the squad. “The emotional development of our team is something we’ve really worked hard on,” he says.</p> \n<p>“We wanted to make sure this group are the most together unit in this tournament and understand what we need to do to perform at our maximum under pressure.”</p> \n<p>A quiet confidence is building. “We’re excited by the challenge. I really feel this tournament is in our hands,” he says. “When we’re at our maximum we have great chance of being successful. All the players are available for selection, all happy and content, a really harmonious group. Their focus now is on the fun part of the tournament, the bit where there’s no tomorrow, where you’ve got to deliver.”</p> \n<p>The Lionesses have never won a World Cup knockout game but Sampson remains undeterred. “The big challenge is can we make history,” he says. “That’s got to be our focus.”</p> \n<p>It helps that the newly fit Karen Carney, England’s most creative individual, and Jodie Taylor, a key striker recovered from knee surgery, are around to help attempt to set a precedent.</p> \n<p>While the influential Carney is Sampson’s “wizard”, England supporters regard Taylor, who came on for the final 10 minutes of the win against Colombia, as integral to their chances. “It’s fantastic to get Jodie on the field,” he says. “Defending against Jodie Taylor, you can’t switch off for a second.”</p> \n<p>He has been burning the midnight oil analysing the rather stunning makeover Norway have undergone since arriving in Canada. “Pre-tournament, Norway were four at the back, one holding in midfield and one striker. Now they’ve reverted to two holding players and one striker off another.</p> \n<p>“They’ve drawn with Germany in the group stage. And they have a coach who’s been there and done it. So, in every area we’re going to be challenged, but we can beat anyone.</p> \n<p>“We’re confident. We know we can hurt Norway. They’re really well organised, fit and strong, determined, and if they can’t find a way on the floor they’ll put the ball in the air. We’ll have to manage that direct threat.”</p> \n<p>An intriguing subplot revolves around the highly technical duel between his youthful courage and the wily pragmatism of Even Pellerud, aged 61. Back in 1995, when Sampson was 12, the Norway manager led his team to World Cup victory. Should Pellerud be wrong-footed even the England coach’s biggest critic might be happy. “My dad’s never pleased,” he says. “But let’s say he’s satisfied at the moment.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/20/1434809753569/mark-sampson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The England head coach Mark Sampson has drilled his players in how to change tactics and formation in the middle of a match.
