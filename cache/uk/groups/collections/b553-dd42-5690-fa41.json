Most notably, swearing is now banned at Newcastle, while two players have already been sent home after turning up for training five minutes late.</p> \n<p>McClaren has kept his family home an hour’s drive down the A19 in the Teesside area since swapping Middlesbrough for England nine years ago. “Living in the area I’ve followed what’s going on at Newcastle,” he said. “I’ve always wanted to work at this club. Driving in to work here for the first time was amazing – it’s a huge club and the stadium is fantastic.”</p> \n<p>Promises from Newcastle’s board to invest in several &pound;10m-plus players left McClaren in buoyant mood as he headed to the United States for a pre-season tour.</p> \n<p>Wijnaldum, 24, became the club’s third most expensive signing – behind Michael Owen and Alan Shearer – after joining for &pound;14.4m from PSV Eindhoven. “It’s a real statement for the club,” said McClaren. “It is a big transfer for a very good player and I am delighted. He’s at the right age and he’s the right fit.”</p> \n<p>But McClaren has also been pleasantly surprised by the current dressing room. “Newcastle’s in good shape,” he said. “Most places you come in and you’ve got a lot of work to do but, internally, this is better than I thought it might be. We’ve got a good squad, some good young players. Sometimes you come in and you’ve got four or five 30-year-olds you’ve got to get out but not here. If you’ve seen the plans here and what’s ahead – what the squad will be like in a year and three windows on – it’s a good situation.”</p> \n<p>Even so, some important questions will have to be addressed. Foremost among them is the identity of McClaren’s captain, amid speculation that Fabricio Coloccini may not keep the armband. “There’s no decision yet,” he said.</p> \n<p>He was a little more forthcoming on Papiss Ciss&eacute;, a striker widely expected to depart Tyneside this summer. “He got 11 goals in 22 games last year, 11 goals in 11 starts and 11 substitute appearances,” said McClaren. “So I think we’ve all got to thank Papiss and his goals for Newcastle still being in the Premier League. Papiss is infectious around the place, smiling every day. He’s here – and that’s it at the moment.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436530345775/Steve-McClaren-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Steve McClaren has high hopes for the new season after being bouyed by promises from Newcastle’s board to invest in several £10m-plus players.

Thanks to a Fifa-imposed transfer ban and presidential election at the Camp Nou, the Turkish international would not be able to play until January 2016 – by which time he could be long gone.</p> \n<p>It will not actually happen, of course. Not unless Agust&iacute; Benedito wins the election that is being held next Saturday. Benedito, a 51-year-old with a chain of car dealerships and experience from two previous elections, says he would rather sign Marco Verratti from Paris Saint-Germain and that if he is elected Turan will be sent back. The transfer was set up by the outgoing board and finalised by a theoretically independent temporary committee who added the clause to enable Benedito, or whoever wins, to do just that – at a cost of €3.4m to Barcelona, 10% of the fee.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/10/barcelona-arda-turan-xavi-iniesta\">Barcelona’s Arda Turan: I’m not new Xavi but can’t wait to play with Iniesta</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Benedito, the third favourite, almost certainly will not win and is the only candidate who would actually return Turan, but he is not the only one furious at the deal. It has also been attacked by the other two candidates, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/barcelona-joan-laporta-president-stand-again\" title=\"\">Joan Laporta</a> and Toni Freixa. The interim committee’s role is to manage the day-to-day running of the Catalan club during elections, not to sign players, according to three of the four candidates; the fourth, the outgoing Josep Maria Bartomeu, publicly encouraged them to complete the deal. <em>His</em> deal.</p> \n<p>Asked why Barcelona had signed Turan now and not waited until after the elections, Bartomeu talked about the pressure that Atl&eacute;tico applied to get the deal done quickly and the desire of the coach, Luis Enrique, to bring him to the Camp Nou. And, in a remark that broke from his normal measured tone, he said: “We’re like that: if we like a player, we sign him.” The response was that they should not be. And who is “we” anyway?</p> \n<p>Benedito described the deal as “disloyal”, “irresponsible” and an “attack on the democratic spirit of the club”. It called into question the neutrality and independence of the committee. Electoral periods are often full of promised signings; now, Bartomeu had actually delivered on one, without even officially being in power. It did not sit right with many. “When he was the president, he acted like a candidate; now that he is a candidate, he acts like he is the president,” Benedito said.</p> \n<p>The doubt is whether signing Turan will help Bartomeu’s campaign as he probably intended, or whether it will instead go against him: here was another act that jars with some supporters. “We’re like that” is a comment that could rebound on him and this is a campaign that may hinge more on questions of identity and off-field probity than the usual staple of signings and populist promises. Turan’s case has caused the elections to spark into life along familiar fault lines, bringing confrontation even more clearly to the surface.</p> \n<p>Of seven pre-candidates, four have made the cut. A €77m deposit-guarantee is required and pre-candidates also needed to collect 2,534 signatures to stand. Jordi Farr&eacute; and Jordi Maj&oacute; did not get through. Nor did the revelation of the pre-campaign, Seguiment FCB – a fans’ group mobilised through social media. When their signatures were analysed by the electoral committee, around 8% were declared null, and they missed out by just 16. Those were not the only signatures that were not accepted: in the kind of story you couldn’t make up, Johan Cruyff’s support for Laporta was also not formally recorded. That leaves four men. Unlike Seguiment, who will be courted by the candidates, they are familiar faces. Bartomeu (8,554 signatures) was never elected but instead replaced Sandro Rosell when he was forced to resign over allegations of tax evasion and corruption over the signing of Neymar. Laporta (with 4,272), who says that under him Barcelona’s commitment to Catalan independence will be unequivocal, was president between 2003 and 2010. Freixa (3,068) was the board’s spokesman under Bartomeu. And Benedito, who gathered 3,367, was on the sporting commission for six years under Laporta.</p> \n<p>In fact, all four men were part of the young, dynamic Laporta team that won the 2003 elections, just as the four candidates that stood in 2010 were: Benedito, Rosell, Marc Ingla, and Jaume Ferrer. Bartomeu’s adviser is Jaume Masferrer, who ran Laporta’s campaign in 2003 and Rosell’s in 2010.</p> \n<p>But if that sounds cosy, it is not. The relationship between Rosell and Laporta, successful president and vice-president in 2003, descended into a civil war that paralleled the ideological divide between Cruyff and Josep Llu&iacute;s N&uacute;&ntilde;ez, president from 1978-2000, that has persevered since, trenches occupied. These are not rivals, they are enemies. Freixa and Benedito have accused Bartomeu of being a front for Rosell, while Laporta described Freixa as Bartomeu’s “submarine”. When, during one debate, Freixa said: “I agree with Laporta,” Laporta shot back: “No, you don’t, because I don’t agree with you on anything.” When Freixa said he did not know what Neymar had cost, Laporta was on to him: “If you don’t know and you were on the board …”</p> \n<p>Polls suggest Laporta may be right when he said that it will be a head to head between him and Bartomeu. Pacts remain possible, and last night Laporta called on Benedito and Freixa to come together with him against Bartomeu.</p> \n<p>Bartomeu has the wholehearted support of the powerful God&oacute; group, which owns <em>El Mundo Deportivo</em> and <em>La Vanguardia</em>, and of a swathe of a largely silent, conservative core support. What’s more, this has been one of the most successful seasons in the club’s history, with the treble of La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League titles.</p> \n<p>These are also atypical elections: names have emerged, with Benedito talking about Verratti, Laporta saying he can sign Paul Pogba and Bartomeu getting Turan, but the Fifa ban means game-changing bombastic promises have been fewer.</p> \n<p>Another position around which campaigns cannot be built this time is that of coach. Bartomeu kept Luis Enrique and called elections in January <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jan/07/luis-enrique-ultimatum-barcelona-crisis\" title=\"\">when a sacking appeared certain</a>; now every candidate says they will stick with him. <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/barcelona-extend-luis-enrique-contract\" title=\"\">He is, after all, the man that won the treble</a> – a treble that might be Bartomeu’s trump card. But Laporta also won a treble in 2009 and claims to have laid the foundations for this success, too, the true architect of an edifice he says is actually being torn down. As for him, he would love the chance to tear into Bartomeu.</p> \n<p>So far Laporta and his enemy have not met because Bartomeu has avoided debates attended by the other candidates. The four men will come together just once, next week. And in that arena, Laporta is indisputably the better performer: sharper, more decisive, more charismatic. Laporta will have ammunition too. Not everyone has forgotten that elections were called in January amid a genuine crisis on and off the pitch. Bartomeu has sought to claim credit for the successes of the Rosell regime, as well as the 18 months during which he has been president, yet distance himself from the flaws of Rosell’s mandate, and not always convincingly.</p> \n<p>Barcelona have been charged with corruption, with both Rosell and Bartomeu directly accused. Fifa has banned them for openly breaking rules on youth development. The Qatar shirt sponsorship has angered many – Laporta says he will remove it – and the new shirt has defied the club’s statutes to make the lines horizontal, not vertical as the founder, Joan Gamper, stipulated. Under the current regime, sporting director Andoni Zubizarreta was sacked, fewer players have come through La Mas&iacute;a, Barcelona B plunged into crisis and were relegated.</p> \n<p>Lionel Messi publicly attacked the board, Pep Guardiola left, promises made to Eric Abidal were broken and Cruyff had his honorary presidency revoked. Laporta claims to have a “telepathic” relationship with Messi. “I don’t; I call him,” Bartomeu responded. Messi has not said anything and is unlikely to do so but Guardiola, Cruyff and Abidal have, with all the symbolism and power that carries, and all three are openly supporting Laporta.

We obviously feel that the qualities that he has will help us. We’re a team that’s trying to progress and you do that by getting good players into your squad and they will help us. Glen has played at a high level for a very long time and we can benefit from that.”</p> \n<p>Johnson is a free agent after being released by Liverpool. The right-back spent the last six years at Anfield having previously played for West Ham, Chelsea and Portsmouth.</p> \n<p>He has won 54 caps for England since making his debut in 2003 and was part of Roy Hodgson’s squad at last summer’s World Cup.

We’ve got other irons in the fire and sometimes, if you invest too much time in one deal, then you can lose others. That was the case with this one, so we’ve stepped aside and we’re looking at other things now.”</p> \n<p>While Stoke have been busy bringing in reinforcements, they have seen Steven N’Zonzi leave for the Europa League winners, Sevilla, this week and look like losing the goalkeeper Asmir Begovic to Chelsea. On the Begovic situation Hughes said: “I haven’t had an update today but my understanding is that he’s likely to travel to Chelsea and that will be concluded.”</p> \n<p>Hughes also backed the Bosnia and Herzegovina international to push Thibaut Courtois hard for the No1 jersey if he joins the Premier League champions. I would imagine, having worked with Asmir, that he’ll back his ability and he would think he will challenge and get game time there or he wouldn’t have gone there,” the former Chelsea striker said.</p> \n<p>“He’s a confident goalkeeper and a very accomplished goalkeeper, so he’ll push whoever’s in the No1 very, very hard.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436621604449/Glen-Johnson-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The former Liverpool defender Glen Johnson won 54 England caps and also played for West Ham, Chelsea and Portsmouth.

When I was at Everton I got ‘Fellaini’ as well; I think it’s just whoever is a tall midfielder or striker. I might have to try and go with ‘Harry Kane’ next.”</p> \n<p>In truth, the England women’s team have written their own names in history over the past month and there is certainly no pigeonholing Scott, who at almost 6ft was an unorthodox presence in what was generally an advanced right-sided role during the World Cup. Normality will strike on Sunday: Scott is likely to revert to her favoured central-midfield position for her club, Manchester City, when they play Birmingham City as the Women’s Super League resumes to the highest pitch of interest in its five-year history.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/england-heathrow-women-s-world-cup-mark-sampson-super-league\">England team return from Women’s World Cup to start new chapter</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I’d be lying if I said we weren’t tired,” says Scott of a squad that has had scant respite <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/england-heathrow-women-s-world-cup-mark-sampson-super-league\" title=\"\">since landing at Heathrow on Monday</a>. “I think our bodies and minds would like a couple of weeks just to recover. At the same time we want to keep the interest growing and if we can get good crowds to the games this weekend then it would be fantastic. The girls and staff at our clubs have been working hard while we’ve been away, so we want to get out there and join them.”</p> \n<p>Scott was back in training with City on Wednesday but there was a more stately pace on Thursday morning in the form of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/09/england-casey-stoney-rejects-sexism-row-tweet\" title=\"\">a breakfast reception with Prince William at Kensington Palace</a>. The prince, whose relationship with the team has been close over the past decade, has maintained a running joke with Scott since she attempted to slide tackle him during a kickabout eight years ago and she says that his backing constitutes something more than a standard photocall.</p> \n<p>“He came to see us at St George’s Park before the tournament and some people might have looked at it as a sort of tick-box exercise for him but his support’s been great throughout,” she says. “He’s been texting Mark [Sampson], he’s rung the squad, he’s watched all the games and inviting us here is the icing on the cake really.”</p> \n<p>Coffee and croissants with the prince having been taken, Scott is stretching out on the Royal Household football pitch, watching her team-mates kick balls around with a group of local schoolgirls and reflecting on <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report\" title=\"\">the bronze medal</a> that salved the wounds inflicted by the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\" title=\"\">late semi-final defeat by Japan</a>.</p> \n<p>“If you asked us how we got ourselves up for that game [against Germany] now I probably wouldn’t have an answer,” she says. “The day after the Japan game, everyone was so down. We’d wanted to make the final so much and we were mentally tired, physically drained. I remember thinking the day before the Germany game ‘I don’t know how we’re going to get through 90 minutes’ – and then obviously it went to 120.</p> \n<p>“I think we’ve just got a really strong set of women here, who really wanted to go out there and succeed. It shows that if your mind wants something so much, your body can achieve it.”</p> \n<p>Scott believes that there is a need to bottle what has been created within the national team. Speculation – mainly of the idle variety – has arisen about the future of the impressive Sampson but, with England sure to be among the favourites for Euro 2017, his remains a work in progress.</p> \n<p>“It’s very important that he stays,” she says. “We’re starting to build momentum, he’s set out a certain way of working with us and I think there’s a lot more to come from him. He’s contracted for a few more years, so hopefully we can continue as we are.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457455133__\n</div> \n<p>“We’ve come together more as a team under Mark. He focuses a lot on work off the pitch and we’ve got a lot of our fight from the meetings that we’ve had. You could see how much we wanted to battle for each other and the girls’ determination was one of the pleasing things, looking back. I think Mark is responsible for that. It’s something he chose as a key focus – and it paid off.”</p> \n<p>There will be pressure to create a lasting, wider legacy and, while that can be a nebulous term, Scott says this summer’s tournament will have deeper long-term effects than earlier events, whose afterglows burned fleetingly.</p> \n<p>“Just look at this now,” she motions to the children, aged between seven and 12, playing in front of her. “Twenty years ago you’d have been at an event like this and seen two girls here out of 40 children. The difference is huge. We always say after tournaments that we need to keep the interest going and the question is always ‘how?’.</p> \n<p>“It starts with club games, promoting them and getting bums on seats, but it also starts right here, today, getting the girls involved and meeting the needs of everyone who wants to play.

Last month the FA announced record crowds for the first half of the season, with average attendances of 892 in WSL1 and 326 in WSL2. This is welcome news – an increase of 8% and 12% over the same period last year and, overall, slightly ahead of the FA’s target – but the headlines tell only part of the story.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/09/england-casey-stoney-rejects-sexism-row-tweet\">Casey Stoney rejects sexism row over FA’s ‘mothers and partners’ tweet</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Played during the summer months, the WSL is the top tier of the woman’s game in England, but it contains only 18 teams in two divisions. The aggregate attendance each week across the whole league is only 5,198.</p> \n<p>The minuscule number of spectators contrasts starkly with the number of players. For more than a decade women’s football has been the nation’s fastest-growing participation sport and, according to the latest FA figures, of the 11 million adults and children playing regularly, some 3.1 million are female. So why are almost none of these players becoming supporters?</p> \n<p>The traditional audience for live football is predominantly male and a significant proportion remains entirely blind to the appeal of women’s football. That view is changing, but you do not have to speak to many male fans before egregious comparisons with the men’s game emerge: the old canards about poor goalkeeping, a lack of pace and physicality. These prejudices tend to be deep-seated and even a World Cup that saw England winning the third-place play-off over their nemesis Germany in a tournament that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/womens-world-cup-awards-of-tournament-guardian-usa\" title=\"\">compares well with many moribund international ones</a> of recent memory is unlikely to dispel them. Some men simply do not like the idea of women even playing football, let alone being good at it.</p> \n<p>With that mindset, it seems logical that in the search for fans clubs should reach out to those millions of women playing the game regularly instead and indeed this does appear to be the case. Yet in many ways the challenge of winning over this audience is no less significant. For a start they are not watching matches at the moment and, as any marketing type will tell you, there is nothing more difficult than changing consumer behaviour.</p> \n<p>The problem is men and women may well enjoy playing football as much as each other, but in other respects their relationship with the game tends to be completely different. Women are generally far less interested in the nerdier aspects that typify the hardcore male supporter: the obsession with stats, facts and figures relating to everything from appearances to – let’s face it – attendances. For example, the bestselling computer simulation Football Manager is an institution among football fans, selling 1.75 million copies a year, but barely 2% of those consumers are female.</p> \n<p>Despite these issues there is evidence that a sizeable audience does exist. Armchair support for England during the World Cup semi-final peaked at 2.4 million viewers, while attendance for the national side’s most recent home game was 45,619: the equivalent of around half an entire season of WSL matches. The challenge is converting these passive national supporters into proactive fans of their local clubs.</p> \n<p>With an average attendance of 1,303, Notts County are the best supported club in the WSL. The chief executive, Luke Negus-Hill, identifies “excellent media relations” as the key to this achievement. It is a view that is echoed again and again. The WSL’s newest club are Sheffield FC, who in May 2015 won the first Women’s Premier League play-off final. Their reward was the opportunity to apply for a WSL licence; promotion itself was only granted after the club’s sales and marketing plans had been formally approved.</p> \n<p>Sheffield FC’s rise has been remarkable – from formation to WSL in little more than a decade – and one that is testament to the capabilities of their manager, Helen Mitchell, and the work of the chairman, Richard Timms. Yet this is a story that has played out almost entirely without an audience. To fulfil the WSL licence requirements the club must pull in at least 350 fans every week: around four times the WPL average.</p> \n<p>Timms is optimistic and realistic about the club’s chances, “It’s an achievable target – it’s not like we’re being asked to pull 20,000,” he said. “We know from experience with our men’s side that when we get 400 people in our ground, the atmosphere is fantastic and everyone will say they’ve really enjoyed it, but it’s getting them to come back and support us every week that’s difficult. With a limited marketing budget, PR coverage is vital.”</p> \n<p>The targets for this PR activity are the girls and women (along with their families) playing football in the Sheffield and Hallamshire League, the largest grassroots football league in Europe. Julie Higgins is the secretary of the women’s section which operates at every age group from under-9s to adult. “We’re hoping the World Cup will encourage more girls to start playing,” Higgins says. “Last season we were down to 112 teams in the junior section from a high of 160 a few years ago, but the senior section is growing and we’ll probably have between 1,500 to 1,800 players registered altogether.”</p> \n<p>Higgins also runs Sheffield Wednesday Ladies, the league’s biggest club with more than 200 players. “Many girls join us because they support Wednesday or their families do and their aim is progress to the senior team, but that doesn’t really translate into support. Our first team play just below the WPL. It’s a good standard and free to watch, but it’s usually just family and friends who turn up.”</p> \n<p>Despite laying claim to being the most successful women’s team of all time, Higgins’ experience is shared by Doncaster Rovers Belles, whose junior teams also compete in the Sheffield and Hallamshire League. Despite a good season on the pitch, Belles are falling just short of their WSL2 licence requirement with average crowds of 297. Faye Lygo, the Belles marketing director, says: “I can sum up the problems all women’s clubs face in just two words: communication and infrastructure.”</p> \n<p>Lygo’s succinct summary gets to the heart of the matter. There is much to support the view that greater communication would help to unlock demand for watching women’s football. It has certainly transformed perceptions of the national team. However, many clubs are finding it very difficult to get any media interest at all. “Coverage makes a huge difference,” Lygo adds, “but getting sports journalists to engage with us is a struggle.”</p> \n<p>This situation is compounded by the game’s structure: there is a startling lack of cohesion across women’s football. These problems begin at the top with the WSL itself and cascade downwards. The league’s format, with fewer than 10 home games and an extended mid-season break, discourages habitual attendance. Moreover, while the WSL has a summer season, the rest of the sport –from the second-tier WPL to grassroots’ under-9s – is played during the winter.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/08/england-fran-kirby-chelsea-reading-record-fee\">England’s Fran Kirby joins Chelsea from Reading for record fee</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Anyone trying to navigate their way through women’s football will quickly finds it is completely disconnected. There are no channels of communication from the top down. Junior clubs are often completely separate entities to the seniors (as is the case with Belles). Neither Manchester City, Notts County, Sheffield FC nor Doncaster Belles have their own centre of excellence, while Manchester United, Sheffield United,York and Lincoln all have CoEs but no senior teams to feed the players they produce into.</p> \n<p>The result is that few girls playing in junior leagues, or their parents, have any idea about the structure of the game beneath the England team. This makes it very difficult for them to find out about it, let alone follow it.</p> \n<p>The outcome is a vicious circle: the clubs charge, almost certainly correctly, that more media support equals bigger attendances, while the media look at WSL figures and argue back that there is no demand.</p> \n<p>The FA cannot control the media, but it could do more. Initiatives like streaming news and information about the WSL (and WPL during the winter months) through the local FA and club websites would be an easy, cost-effective way to raise awareness.</p> \n<p>But what the women’s game really needs above all is a plan to bring its various disconnected parts together and enable them to work in concert. Until that happens it is likely to remain beyond the power of most clubs to turn those millions of female players into thousands of supporters.</p> \n<p><span class=\"bullet\">•</span> <em>Steve McKevitt writes about marketing, communications and football.

As was the case in April 2014, and following on from the recommendation of a three-man panel from the FA’s membership committee, the council again voted against changing the 111-year-old name of Hull City AFC.</p> \n<p>The decision was supported by 69.9% of the council, an increase on the 63.5% who rejected Hull’s application 15 months ago. The FA chairman, Greg Dyke, supported the name change, according to the Football Supporters Federation (FSF) whose chair, Malcolm Clarke, attended the meeting.</p> \n<p>A statement released by the FA made no mention of Dyke’s preference but said: “The FA council has rejected Hull City’s application to change their playing name to Hull Tigers. The council’s decision – carried by a 69.9% vote of its members – came after a recommendation from the FA’s Membership Committee. The council, which is made up of representatives from across football, fully considered the recommendation in reaching its decision.”</p> \n<p>While the vote will delight many Hull supporters there could be long-term ramifications for a club that was relegated from the Premier League last season. Allam proposed the Hull Tigers rebrand on the basis that it was in the best commercial interests of the club and the surest way of attracting overseas investment.</p> \n<p>The businessman, who led a buy-out of the financially troubled club in 2010, has threatened to sell Hull if the name change idea was thwarted. Having challenged the FA council’s initial rejection via an independent arbitration tribunal last year, Hull cannot appeal against Saturday’s decision although the possibility of a third application has not been discounted.</p> \n<p>“We will be taking some time away from the club to consider our options and we will make no further comment until we have come to a conclusion,” read a statement released by Hull. Dyke said: “I don’t think Hull can appeal. They could put in a new application to try to change it with better research etcetera and that might change the view, but as of now the Hull application has been rejected.”</p> \n<p>Opposition to Hull Tigers was led by the Hull City Supporters’ Trust, who said in a statement they were delighted with the decision and wished “to record our gratitude to the FA for securing the heritage of Hull City and for listening to the supporters of the club.” It added: “This decision will also be welcomed by fans of other clubs who may be concerned that their clubs might, at some point in the future, face a similar threat.”</p> \n<p>The trust is to table two motions at the FSF’s annual general meeting next weekend aimed at avoiding similar controversies at other clubs. If passed, the FSF will encourage the FA to tighten its rules on heritage issues “so that a football club’s playing name, badge, colours and so forth cannot be changed without proper consultation with that club’s supporters, and that a club’s media should use only those approved elements in communications and publicity”.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/5e6f705cdeb01867917f3ecfa95fa9a3e373589f/0_0_2664_1599/2664.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1599,"width":2664,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Matt West/BPI/REX/Matt West/BPI/REX","altText":"Barclays Premier League 2014/15 Hull City v Chelsea KC Stadium, West Park, Hull, United Kingdom - 22 Mar 2015<br>Editorial use only.
