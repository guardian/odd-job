Picking up Alexis S&aacute;nchez from Barcelona during the 2014 World Cup, and Mesut &Ouml;zil from Real Madrid in 2013, proved transformative. Before that, during the summer of 2012, Wenger took advantage of M&aacute;laga’s financial crisis to welcome Santi Cazorla, a little bundle of bewitching footwork whose arrival, in its own way, was just as much of a masterstroke.</p> \n<p>Cazorla was Wenger’s choice as Arsenal’s outstanding performer last season. “From start to finish he was absolutely top,” said the manager. It was more the capacity to make the players around him look better rather than the virtuoso moments that really struck a chord with Wenger. Cazorla orchestrated with such intelligence from central midfield, while Francis Coquelin took care of the ball-winning alongside him, and the foundation for a big team improvement finally had its balanced base. Cazorla might have looked like a luxury player when he first arrived at Arsenal but he has evolved into a leader right at the hub of it all.</p> \n<p>The characteristic that serves him so well is being comfortable with both feet. It was a quality that arrived by accident when an injury forced him to improvise. “I always preferred my right foot,” he says. “Ever since I was young that was my preferred foot. Once I was a little bit hurt in my right ankle and therefore I started to use my left foot a lot more.</p> \n<p>“What I would do after training is stay half an hour and kick the ball against a wall with my weaker foot over and over again to make sure it gets stronger. And young players should remember that everything comes from the base of hard work, so never give up. Being able to use both feet was something that came quite naturally to me ever since I started playing. However, it’s something I work on all the time to make sure that level never gets any lower.”</p> \n<p>Cazorla is 30 and speaks with a steely determination to keep pushing himself, as if he senses there are grander career highlights to experience. Arsenal’s two FA Cup wins are his only club honours. Although he has an admirable collection of 73 caps for Spain over a period when his country has won trophies, he was mostly a substitute for the triumphant European Championship in 2008 and 2012 and missed the World Cup in 2010 with a hernia injury.</p> \n<p>He is already focused on striving for big things next season. “We finished the season very strong. We would obviously like to prepare ourselves a lot better for the upcoming season, for a better placement in the Champions League as well as the Premier League.</p> \n<p>“I see we have a very strong team. What we need to work on is consistency and our mental toughness to get to the next level. We know we can do that. Yes, Chelsea is strong; yes, they won the Premier League, but without a doubt we have a team that is strong enough to do so. We just have to work on fine tuning.</p> \n<p>“In Europe teams like Real Madrid and Barcelona have some of the best players in the world. It’s something we have to aspire to and try to position ourselves in that sense.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73ab6ce037eefee868c5f7c729158a39da91e7c6\"> \n <img src=\"http://media.guim.co.uk/73ab6ce037eefee868c5f7c729158a39da91e7c6/0_680_2398_1439/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Santi Cazorla\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Santi Cazorla in Arsenal’s new Puma kit for the 2015-16 season. Source: Puma</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Cazorla is not the only Arsenal player who is hoping another high-calibre signing or two will join to push them up another step in their quest for honours next season. He recalls the thrill when he heard that &Ouml;zil and S&aacute;nchez were signing and wants that impetus again.</p> \n<p>“I got very excited,” he says. “It’s extremely important to see how everyone gets excited because the more players of the calibre of Alexis and Mesut that join, the better I will become as a player and the better the team will become. Because of their style of play their games combine together, and the best thing for us is the team is stronger because of it.”</p> \n<p>Cazorla was impressed to see Jack Wilshere expressing his talent for club and country. It puzzles him how unusual it is for English players to venture to foreign clubs. It has become quite routine for Spanish players to travel but their English counterparts are relative homebods. Wilshere has the quality to move to La Liga. “He is definitely someone who could play in Spain,” Cazorla says. “He’s very talented and a great player. We’re lucky to have him at Arsenal but if ever he decided to move forward in his career, definitely he has the level and the capability to be able to play in a Spanish team.</p> \n<p>“It’s strange that we don’t see more English players going to the Spanish league. We’ve seen Beckham and Owen, for example, but besides that we don’t see as many as we would like to.”</p> \n<p>Spanish clubs would appear more likely to try to tempt Cazorla back. There have been whispers of a return during his time at Arsenal but for now he has no itchy feet. He is happy for them to twinkle in England. “For the time being, Arsenal is my home. I’m not thinking about the future. I live day by day and right now Arsenal is my way. It’s my life.”</p> \n<p><em>Santi Cazorla was speaking at #ForeverArsenal, the launch of the Puma 2015-2016 Arsenal home kit</em></p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434484491742/Santi-Cazorla-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Santi Cazorla believes Arsenal 'need to work on consistency and our mental toughness to get to the next level'.

The goal was Wambach’s 14th in a World Cup, making her tied for second highest all-time goals with Germany’s Birgit Prinz, and one behind Brazil legend Marta.</p> \n<p>Wambach’s role in the team <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/abby-wambach-usa-womens-world-cup-nigeria\">had become a topic of discussion</a>, but she returned to the starting line-up for the USA after not starting on Friday for the time in a World Cup match since 2003. Her impact was palpable, setting up defender Julie Johnston for a goal in the first few minutes – but it was chalked off because Johnston was a step offside.</p> \n<p>“We needed a goal, and the timing of it was perfect,” Wambach said. “The longer you stay in a third game in any tournament [without a goal], the more a team like Nigeria gets confidence. So, getting that goal right before half was big for us.”</p> \n<p>“It feels great to help my team win this game, to help my team advance to number one in the group.”</p> \n<p>Although USA were likely to advance to the knockout stage regardless of Tuesday’s result, the match still held major implications. If the Americans hadn’t won Group D and finished second, they would have had to travel five time zones away and 3,500 miles away to Moncton to face Brazil, who won Group E. With their win, the Americans head to the knockout round in Edmonton where they will face a team that finishes third in another group, to be determined after other groups finish play.</p> \n<p>The Nigerians hardly looked up to the task of winning, which they needed to do to book a spot in the knockout rounds. Although they used their speed well on the counter, they looked tentative in the attack, failing to get shots off quickly enough before the American defense swooped in repeatedly the rescue.</p> \n<p>The Americans doubled Nigeria’s shots, 14 to seven, with seven shots on goal to Nigeria’s two, but left the match with a low shot conversion rate and just one goal to show for all their chances. Even as the Nigerians went down to 10 players with 20 minutes left when Sarah Nnodim received a second booking, the Americans still struggled to capitalize.</p> \n<p>“We need a higher conversion rate,” USA coach Jill Ellis said. “It’s in our statistical review, in terms of what we’re trying to achieve in games. The players will be disappointed we didn’t convert, but obviously pleased we got the one.”</p> \n<p>Goalkeeper Precious Dede denied Alex Morgan on a breakaway at the start of the half, lunging to catch the chip attempt over her head. Morgan had a do-over chance 15 minutes later, set up by fullback Ali Krieger, but Dede slid out to smother the ball, denying Morgan again.</p> \n<p>Morgan started her first match since early April. She <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/make-up-shorts-improving-womens-game-brazil?CMP=twt_gu\">told the Guardian last week that she felt ready to start</a>, but only played 12 minutes against Sweden in a scoreless draw on Friday. She was replaced in the 66th minute with Vancouver native Sydney Leroux.</p> \n<p>“I really thought I was going to finish that one from the last couple minutes I was in, but the Nigerian keeper made a really good save, actually,” Morgan said. “I would like to score, but at the end of the day we won, and I felt like I got a really good 65 minutes.”</p> \n<p>Johnston and Becky Sauerbrunn both shone in the their center-back roles, each cutting out dangerous opportunities from Nigeria’s speedy attackers.

I don’t think I’d know how to film a match on a phone but Dave’s done a great job trekking round the world and getting a few more stamps in his passport.”</p> \n<p>Sampson and his coaches have been able to join the dots in Gough’s dossier after the luxury of viewing complete television recordings of <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/colombia-mexico-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Colombia’s 1-1 draw with Mexico</a> and shock 2-0 win over the group favourites France. Along the way Felipe Taborda’s team scored their first ever World Cup goals and win.</p> \n<p>“Watching the first two games, what we’ve been fed back from Goughy is becoming very clear,” says England’s coach. “We’re in a better place than if we’d had to play them first.”</p> \n<p>Not that an England win is exactly simple. “This is a dangerous Colombian team,” says Sampson. “Emotionally they’re now in a fantastic place. They’ve beaten the favourites and they’ve got a huge confidence boost. You can feel their energy. They’ve got tremendous national pride and they’re well placed to qualify. They’re resolute, very strong physically and they’re going to be really tough opponents.</p> \n<p>“They’re not as structured as European teams but we’ve still got to break down their deep defensive block and work around the centre-back who sits in front of the back four and does a great job breaking up attacks. And we’ve got to deal with their threat on the counterattacks.”</p> \n<p>While the coach fine-tunes his gameplan, England’s travel department are faced with a logistical nightmare. Depending on the outcome of both their match and France v Mexico, which kicks off at the same time in Ottawa, England could conceivably finish anywhere in Group F.</p> \n<p>Topping it means remaining in Montreal, potentially until the final in Vancouver. Second place means relocating to Ottawa for the round of 16, and qualifying as one of the four best third-place finishers involves heading to Edmonton or Vancouver on Thursday morning.</p> \n<p>“Our travel planners are looking at all the possible flights and hotels,” says Sampson. “There’s so many permutations but there’s no panic, more a sense of calm. We’ll take the hand we’re dealt.</p> \n<p>“Three points against Colombia puts us through, whether that’s as first or second we’ll have to wait and see and, potentially, a point also gets us through. So we’re in a good place, Colombia’s not a must-win.”</p> \n<p>There seems a newfound serenity about the Welshman in the wake of Saturday’s restorative <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/england-mexico-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">2-1 win over Mexico</a>. After <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/france-england-womens-world-cup-group-f-match-report\" title=\"\">losing last Tuesday’s opener</a> in a defensive performance against France, he was heavily criticised and evidently felt under pressure to deliver his first major tournament win.</p> \n<p>“The players took the flak, accepted the criticism,” he says. “They really embraced it. They opened up to the pressure and took it on board. We raised the bar against Mexico and the challenge now is to push it even higher against Colombia. In terms of mood it was about not getting too low after France, now it’s about not getting too high.”</p> \n<p>England’s medical team are learning about pressure too. “Our medical team have been overworked,” Sampson says. “This tournament chucks some challenges at them, the turf for one.”</p> \n<p>The tournament’s artificial pitches are proving tricky. “We always knew some players would take a little longer to recover on these surfaces,” he says. “We’ve looked into the impact of this kind of surface on certain joints and muscles and recovery times and put certain procedures in place.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/ng-interactive/2015/jun/05/womens-world-cup-canada-2015\">Women's World Cup 2015 - interactive wallchart</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>There is also the need to prevent the players’ feet overheating on pitches which are routinely about 16C (30F) hotter than their grass equivalents. “The hot surfaces are something we prepared for,” says Sampson. “The players were aware of the type of boots they’ve got to wear but I’m not giving away the secrets of the way we try to protect them and keep their feet cool.”</p> \n<p>Fran Kirby and Karen Carney, both scorers against Mexico, have particularly gifted size sixes. While Kirby – Sampson’s <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/womens-world-cup-2015-england-fran-kirby-mini-messi\" title=\"\">Mini Messi</a> – seems certain to start, Carney – dubbed The Wizard by her coach – has only recently recovered from back trouble and it is less certain she can last 90 minutes.</p> \n<p>No matter, Sampson is simply pleased to have his creative catalyst in Canada. “Carney’s had to sacrifice a lot,” he says. “She’s dedicated the last sixth months of her life to getting fit for this tournament.”</p> \n<p>Like Kirby, Carney has suffered bouts of severe depression. The 27-year-old acknowledges there were times, a few years ago, when she hated football with a passion and could barely drag herself to training.</p> \n<p>Her recovery has been accompanied by a renewed zest for the game. Yet much as she is relishing being part of Canada 2015, Carney knows Colombia may not be pleasant opponents. “They’ll be flamboyant and in your face,” she says. “They’ll kick and foul you. They’ll break up play and frustrate you. We’ll need to be really switched on.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434467964637/Karen-Carney-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The England coach Mark Sampson will be hoping Karen Carney can be the creative lynchpin against Colombia.

Chelsea will seek to make a profit on a player who is also interesting his hometown club Lyon, recently qualified for the Champions League and through whose youth academy he graduated before moving to Nice in 2008.</p> \n<p>The Premier League champions could even explore the possibility of recruiting Lyon’s highly-rated France Under-21 international defender Samuel Umtiti as part of a possible deal. Umtiti, who was born in Cameroon, can play at centre-half or left-back and is of interest with Filipe Lu&iacute;s expected to leave Stamford Bridge for a return to Atl&eacute;tico Madrid this summer.</p> \n<p>R&eacute;my will seek to ascertain what role has been earmarked for him next season with the Premier League champions before determining his next move, but is keen to gain regular game-time to ensure he plays a part in Didier Deschamps’ France squad at Euro 2016.</p> \n<p>Chelsea could potentially follow up Falcao’s arrival on a 12-month loan with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/05/chelsea-consider-move-atletico-madrid-antoine-griezmann\" title=\"\">a move for Antoine Griezmann from Atl&eacute;tico</a> – the Frenchman has a &pound;43m buyout clause in his contract – which would see them beginning the defence of their title with a revamped forward line.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434469187496/4fc814ff-d57d-4193-a612-d8fbdb08c053-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Andrew Aylett/Corbis","altText":"Chelsea would need to try and recoup the £10.5m they paid QPR for Loïc Rémy.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Andrew Aylett/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T16:07:00Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T16:08:31Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Dominic Fifield","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/5/22/1400768136849/Dominic-Fifield-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/dominicfifield"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Chelsea","Transfer window","Radamel Falcao","Colombia","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/chelsea","webTitle":"Chelsea"},{"id":"football/transfer-window","webTitle":"Transfer window"},{"id":"football/radamel-falcao","webTitle":"Radamel Falcao"},{"id":"football/colombia","webTitle":"Colombia"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Dominic Fifield","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/dominicfifield"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/loi-remy-role-chelsea-radamel-falcao","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49p8e","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/16/loi-remy-role-chelsea-radamel-falcao","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/16/loi-remy-role-chelsea-radamel-falcao"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/16/1434469187496/4fc814ff-d57d-4193-a612-d8fbdb08c053-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chelsea would need to try and recoup the £10.5m they paid QPR for Loïc Rémy.
