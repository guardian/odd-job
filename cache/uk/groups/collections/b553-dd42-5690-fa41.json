But it simply has not worked out for him in front of goal, where his instincts have frequently deserted him.</p> \n<p>The Spaniard, 30, has scored only three times from open play in the Premier League, to go with four penalties, while he scored seven goals (one of them a penalty) in the Europa League and two in the Capital One Cup. Under the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, Soldado found his starting opportunities in the league dried up and he has now resolved to find another club.</p> \n<p>There has been interest in him from Spain. Tottenham are determined to hold out for a decent fee but they are confident of doing business, not least because of Soldado’s eagerness to move.</p> \n<p>The situation is more straightforward than that of Adebayor, who has one year to run on his &pound;100,000-a-week contract. The 31-year-old is a target for clubs in Turkey, including Besiktas, but at the moment he is not willing to leave unless it is for a lucrative contract and/or an elite club.</p> \n<p>Tottenham relied heavily on Kane last season, when he emerged to stunning effect, scoring 31 goals for the club, but the management are realistic enough to know that it could be harder for him in his second season at the top level.</p> \n<p>They tried to sign Danny Ings from Burnley this summer but were beaten to his signature by Liverpool and they have otherwise been relatively quiet in the hunt for a striker, although they did show an interest in Monaco’s Anthony Martial. The 19-year-old has now extended his contract at the French club. Tottenham have tried to sign Aston Villa’s Christian Benteke in previous windows but have made no move this summer.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/columnists/2015/7/8/1436371075871/Roberto-Soldado-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Roberto Soldado, left, scores one of his few goals for Tottenham, against Fiorentina in the Europa League in February 2015.
