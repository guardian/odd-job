Mervyn Day, the club’s head of recruitment, has also been placed on garden leave with Burton.</p> \n<p>A statement said that the decisions were made “as part of the ongoing review of the club’s performance” and that Albion would look to fill the positions in due course. It is not anticipated, however, that appointments will be made soon, with Pulis preferring to operate within a structure that allows him to be hands-on in all areas of the club.</p> \n<p>The Welshman’s immediate priority is strengthening the playing squad. Austin, the Queens Park Rangers striker who would command a club-record fee in excess of &pound;10m, and Lambert, who is surplus to requirements at Anfield, are both targets and Albion’s interest in both players comes at a time when the club hope to persuade Saido Berahino to sign a new contract.</p> \n<p>Berahino scored 20 goals in all competitions last season and Pulis wants to retain the 21-year-old’s services as well as adding some firepower to reduce the burden on him for the new campaign. Albion face plenty of competition for Austin, who was the fourth-highest goalscorer in the Premier League last season, and it may well be that the QPR winger Matt Phillips – another player on Pulis’s wish-list - is a more realistic Loftus Road target. Lambert, with his physical presence, offers different attributes.</p> \n<p>Either way, it seems likely that Brown Ideye, Victor Anichebe and St&eacute;phane Sess&egrave;gnon will all move on as Pulis starts to shape the squad before a season when it is still unclear whether the club will change hands. Jeremy Peace, Albion’s chairman, has signalled his intention to sell up and it is believed that a Chinese consortium has shown serious interest in taking over at The Hawthorns. Albion are expected to release a statement within the next 24 hours clarifying the takeover situation.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435702826373/Charlie-Austin-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"QPR striker Charlie Austin would cost West Brom in excess of £10m.

The 29-year-old is attracted to the idea of returning to the Premier League, where he had flourished after a move from Lille in 2011, and with working with his former manager on Tyneside, Alan Pardew.</p> \n<p>PSG are willing to allow the player to leave after he made his frustrations clear at Parc des Princes, with Palace the most persuasive of his suitors to date. The south London club, whose squad return to pre-season training on Monday, finished 10th last season courtesy of an eye-catching revival instigated by Pardew after his appointment at the turn of the year, and are seeking to add three or four senior players to their ranks this summer. The owners are ambitious and are seeking to maintain the club’s progress after five years of constant growth under their stewardship.</p> \n<p>The France midfielder would still cost around &pound;10m and, though his wages would top anything currently being paid by Palace, there is a willingness to do a deal. The board recognise that other clubs may rival their bid. While Tottenham Hotspur are understood not to have an interest in Cabaye at present, Southampton – another club who can offer European football next season – may be attracted to a deal if Morgan Schneiderlin, as expected, moves to Manchester United. West Ham, who begin their own Europa League campaign on Thursday, may also consider entering the running.</p> \n<p>Palace’s business in the current window to date has been limited to re-signing Brede Hangeland on a new one-year contract, though they are close to agreeing a new four-year deal with the Scotland midfielder, James McArthur, who joined last year from Wigan Athletic. There is interest in Chelsea’s Lo&iuml;c R&eacute;my, another France international who played under Pardew at Newcastle, and the Queens Park Rangers forwards Charlie Austin and Matt Phillips. That pair are being heavily courted by West Bromwich Albion and could cost around &pound;20m to prise from Loftus Road.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435697577912/Yohan-Cabaye-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yohan Cabaye played for Alan Pardew at Newcastle for three years before joining PSG.
