The initial plan was to remove the upper tiers of the stadium and scale it back to a modest 25,000-seat bowl after the Games.</p> \n<p>But the coalition government and Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, urged a rethink in 2010, reasoning that it was folly to in effect knock it down and that only football could provide a sustainable future. Following a bitter battle with Tottenham Hotspur, a deal was eventually agreed with West Ham that later collapsed under legal challenge.</p> \n<p>Following another tender process, the club were awarded a 99-year lease to share the stadium with other tenants including UK Athletics. The operator of the Stade de France was recently appointed to handle the running of the stadium and to book concerts and sporting events to supplement income.</p> \n<p>Last year the LLDC admitted that the cost had risen to &pound;193.9m as a result of difficulties that Balfour Beatty was experiencing with the world’s largest cantilevered roof.</p> \n<p>The LLDC said that the deals it had signed with West Ham, who will in effect be the main tenants during the football season, and British Athletics, which is entitled to use for the whole of July, would ensure that it would not require continuing subsidy from the taxpayer.</p> \n<p>“We have invested in transforming a temporary athletics venue into a permanent world-class multiuse arena that has a secure and long-term sustainable future,” said the LLDC’s chief executive, David Goldstone. “This has required a significant amount of work and innovative engineering solutions.</p> \n<p>“Alongside the transformation work the deals signed with British Athletics and West Ham United and the appointment of a stadium operator ensures the stadium will pay its way and not require any continuing subsidy from the taxpayer.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/apr/21/west-ham-olympic-stadium-timeline-tottenham-hotspur-leyton-orient-owen-gibson\">West Ham’s long and winding road to the Olympic Stadium</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The largest chunk of funding for the transformation comes from a one-off settlement of &pound;148.8m from the exchequer in 2010.

UK Athletics has invested &pound;1m and the London Marathon Charitable Trust has provided &pound;3.5m.</p> \n<p>In return for investing &pound;40m for a share in the special purpose vehicle that owns the stadium, Newham council has been guaranteed access to the stadium and up to 100,000 tickets a year to West Ham matches.</p> \n<p>West Ham are set to move into the stadium, which will have 21,000 moveable seats designed to make it more suitable for football, at the start of the 2016-17 season.</p> \n<p>The club’s vice-chair, Karren Brady, who has sold out of some of the executive box offerings, has promised cut-price season tickets in order to fill the ground and make Premier League football more affordable.</p> \n<p>Johnson blamed a lack of planning by his predecessors for the cost of transforming the stadium into a 54,000-seat multipurpose arena.</p> \n<p>Concerned about the potential for delays and without a definite commitment from a football club, the Olympic board decided in 2007 to press ahead with plans to build the stadium with a demountable top tier that could be removed afterwards to bring the capacity down to 25,000.</p> \n<p>“A very bad call was made when those in charge at the time backed a stadium construction plan that would leave the Olympic Park with a much smaller, mouldering and tumbleweed ridden arena following the Games,” Johnson said. “Following that plan would have literally torn the heart out of the park and put at risk the incredible economic regeneration we are now seeing in east London.</p> \n<p>“Our remedy offered long-term sustainable investment in order to protect an iconic stadium that Londoners took to their hearts, and which is now set to be home to almost every conceivable sport, concert or community event for decades to come.</p> \n<p>“We’ve created a knockout venue that will drive and sustain thousands of jobs, where we’ve ensured that a hefty share of the profits will be paid back into the taxpayers coffers and which provides a genuine Olympic legacy for our city.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434716373751/Olympic-Stadium-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"An artist's impression of how the Olympic Stadium will look when West Ham move in for the 2016-17 season.

In the summer of 2013, on the back of two undistinguished and largely unheralded loan spells at Leicester and Norwich, Harry Kane was England’s main striker in the Under-20 World Cup in Turkey. Now he is once again leading the line for his country in an international youth tournament but this time, here at the European Under-21 Championship, his preceding season involved a deluge of goals for Tottenham Hotspur and a full England debut.</p> \n<p>Whereas the 2013 Kane enjoyed relative anonymity the 2015 version cannot walk the 100 yards or so from the team hotel in Olomouc to the Legionarska training ground next door without fielding requests for autographs and photos. On Spurs’ tour of Asia and Australia last month a stroll to a Sydney shopping centre had to be abandoned when hordes of fans mobbed Kane and two team-mates en route. There is a Twitter campaign aimed at making him the man to join Lionel Messi on the front cover of the <a href=\"https://www.easports.com/uk/fifa/cover-vote/\" title=\"\">Fifa 16 video game</a>.</p> \n<p>England will hope that the differences are not only off the field. In Turkey Peter Taylor’s Under-20s failed to win a game and finished bottom of a group that also included Chile, Egypt and Iraq. Kane could have been forgiven had the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/18/england-portugal-european-under-21-championship\" title=\"\">opening defeat for the Under-21s</a> against Portugal in Uherske Hradiste on Thursday raised the spectre of tournaments past but the 21-year-old remains confident the team can recover and return to winning ways against Sweden on Sunday.</p> \n<p>“We were 2-0 up and in cruise control mode [against Iraq],” said Kane. “They got a penalty, then ended up scoring in the last minute. As a group that hit us hard and we never really recovered. We drew with Chile in the next game but it isn’t going to happen in this group. We’ve got too many experienced players who have been there before and done it not to put it right. We know what we have to do.”</p> \n<p>His development since that troublesome tournament in Turkey has been rapid and the trappings accompanying new-found fame at times mind-boggling. Kane describes that shopping trip in Sydney as the most surreal experience of his career – the players had to make their escape back to the team hotel by hopping on to a coach, which was fortunately nearby – but is unflustered by the attention.</p> \n<p>“I don’t mind it,” he said. “Obviously it’s just the start for me. Maybe in the years to come I’ll get a bit grumpy but no, it’s fine. I’ve always been happy to talk to fans, to do things with fans. Sometimes you don’t know how far they’ve travelled just to meet you. So if you don’t sign something or don’t talk to them it could be heartbreaking for them.</p> \n<p>“I was a fan once and I’d always want someone I’ve looked up to to be a nice guy and that’s what I try and be. I don’t think that will ever change. I think I’ll always sign stuff for fans and take pictures because I know how much it means.”</p> \n<p>Kane’s focus for the next few days, though, will be on keeping England in the tournament. Against Portugal there were moments when a gap in class was apparent. For example, when Monaco’s Bernardo Silva and Sporting’s Jo&atilde;o M&aacute;rio, both of whom played Champions League football last season, were breaking past Nathaniel Chalobah, who ended the season at Reading, and on towards Middlesbrough’s Ben Gibson and Leicester’s Liam Moore in the centre of the England defence. But the gap was not as big as those CVs suggest. And Rui Jorge’s side were arguably the most impressive of the eight here in the first round of matches.</p> \n<p>Sweden, who beat Italy despite being reduced to 10 men and went 1-0 down after 28 minutes, offer a different threat, a more direct, muscular and – whisper it – typically English approach in their 4-4-2 formation. That could allow greater freedom for Tom Carroll in the central attacking midfield role and, in the wide positions, Nathan Redmond and Alex Pritchard, who may replace Jesse Lingard in the starting XI after impressing as a late substitute on Thursday.</p> \n<p>The chief aim, though, for Gareth Southgate’s side must be to get more support to Kane, who cut an occasionally isolated figure against Portugal. He denies his team-mates look to him as England’s main man – “We have a lot of players in this squad that have done well this season for their clubs; I am just one of them” – but on the occasions he was able to find space on the ball against Portugal he proved his threat, with one fizzing effort from distance particularly troubling Jos&eacute; S&aacute; in the Portugal goal.</p> \n<p>In the absence of the injured Saido Berahino, top scorer in qualifying, Kane’s goal threat becomes even more vital. Although Kane is confident this squad will not crumble under the pressure, five straight defeats at these finals is a worrying trend and one that needs to end. “We are not panicking,” said Kane. “We know what we have to do.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/6/19/1434738578279/Harry-Kane-and-his-Englan-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Harry Kane and his England Under-21 team-mates get to grips with training in readiness to face Sweden.

Here was an administrator so crooked that even Fifa felt he made it look bad, at a time when corruption was all the rage. But he could never really divorce himself. No more than Paul McCartney could leave the Beatles behind.</p> \n<p>Cut Warner and he probably bleeds brown envelopes, just waiting to be stuffed with US dollars. Maybe he sleeps with one stiff arm thrust upwards with palm exposed and on his lips the catchphrase: “What can you do for me?”</p> \n<p>These days Warner has become such a farcical figure that he has literally taken to grappling with comedians and satirical publications.</p> \n<p>“Everybody hates you now, I mean literally, everybody,” said the British comedian John Oliver <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/10/john-oliver-trinidad-television-mock-jack-warner-fifa\" title=\"\">during a five‑minute monologue</a> that he paid to be aired on Trinidad and Tobago television. “I think it’s something to do with you seeming like an absolutely terrible human being. But if you turn on Fifa do not underestimate how much people might be willing to forgive and if one day you end up in jail and you’re staring up at the ceiling, wouldn’t you be happy to know you took some people down with you? It’s like they say: snitches gets smooches.”</p> \n<p>Warner, barely a week after he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/31/ex-fifa-vice-president-jack-warner-swallows-onion-spoof\" title=\"\">mistook an article in The Onion, the American satirical website, for a straight news report</a>, again seemed to drag his response wide of the mark. “I don’t need any advice from any comedian fool who doesn’t know anything about this country to tell me what files to release or what not to release,” said Warner in his retort, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bB7CBxfRUaw\" title=\"\">which was uploaded on YouTube</a>. “That is none of his business and I take no instructions from him. And worse yet, I don’t take any instructions from an American [sic] at this point in time.”</p> \n<p>Once upon a time a frequent traveller who was treated as a visiting dignitary in any of Fifa’s other 208 member associations, Warner cannot spot an English accent these days.</p> \n<p>It has been a long way down for the administrator who once had Nelson Mandela defy doctors’ orders to travel to Trinidad. Mandela was the guest of honour at a charitable dinner held by Warner at the controversial Jo&atilde;o Havelange Centre of Excellence in 2004. But the Cyril Ross Home for Children with HIV/Aids said it never saw a cent of that money. Warner reportedly said expenditure for the event had exceeded income.</p> \n<p>Haiti’s earthquake victims, according to the president of the country’s football association, Dr Yves Jean-Bart, received barely $60,000 of the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/fifa-jack-warner-accused-funds-haiti-earthquake-victims\" title=\"\">$750,000 that Warner ostensibly raised</a> from the South Korea Football Association and Fifa on their behalf in&nbsp;2010.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"gu-fc-66c0af69-2c83-400b-935b-258b044d9b18\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434706769756/54ce0f79-ae47-44ff-a47c-efddfeea98d5-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner \" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The former Fifa vice-president Jack Warner visiting a low-income neighborhood in southern Trinidad in June – days after Fifa’s corruption scandal was exposed.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea De Silva/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Such tales epitomise the real Warner: influential, greedy, heartless and completely devoid of shame. The question on your lips is not so much “why” as it is “how”? How did he get away with it? And how is it that such a man can hold a seat in his country’s parliament as the MP for Chaguanas West, which is a constituency of roughly 28,000 people?</p> \n<p>The answer to that is straightforward: because we let him. And, by “we”, I’m not referring only to my compatriots in Trinidad and Tobago. There was little sophistication to the financial crimes that the US Department of Justice alleges were committed by Warner. Trinidad and Tobago’s financial intelligence unit, tasked since 2013 with unearthing money laundering, has never secured a single conviction. Warner denies any wrongdoing.</p> \n<p>Austin Warner was born on 26 January 1943 in the rural village of Rio Claro in south Trinidad. He was the third of seven children to Wilton and Stella Warner, a truck driver and housewife respectively.</p> \n<p>He was poor, but by Trinidadian standards. That means he did not miss too many meals, he owned school books and his family could afford to send him to school in Port of Spain, the capital, nearly an hour’s drive away. Media tales of Warner walking to school barefoot are a myth, although he probably did have tattered shoes.</p> \n<p>Warner was a decent student at national level but never a brilliant one and he failed to get a national scholarship to the top secondary schools such as St Mary’s college and Queen’s Royal college. At the college of St Philip and St James, which later became Presentation college, Warner claimed a mathematics teacher once called him “jackass” as he fumbled in class. Students, who teased Warner often, rechristened him “Jack” and he used the slight as fuel to rise beyond their wildest dreams.</p> \n<p>Warner was 21 when Trinidad and Tobago joined Fifa in time for an unsuccessful attempt to qualify for the World Cup in England in 1966. He was never any good with the ball at his feet but, at the age of 30, he became his FA’s youngest-ever general secretary.</p> \n<p>By then Warner had come to grips with his real talent, which was bluster and politics. Months later, in 1974, the Brazilian Havelange, the man he proclaimed to be his mentor, replaced the Englishman, Sir Stanley Rous, as Fifa president.</p> \n<p>Warner’s worth to Trinidad and Tobago and Caribbean football is often overstated. The national football team were on the verge of a 1974 World Cup place and controversially finished second to Haiti, after losing 2-1 despite scoring five goals – four of which were disallowed – against the hosts in a qualifying tournament staged by the Haitians.</p> \n<p>It was another 16 years before Trinidad and Tobago did nearly as well, as many of the islands’<strong> </strong>overseas-based stars quit after clashes with Warner over unkept promises or ill-treatment.</p> \n<p>On 19 November 1989 the Trinidad and Tobago coach Everald “Gally” Cummings, who was a key midfielder in 1973, swore that Warner created a scenario that made qualification for the 1990 World Cup almost impossible. The home team, nicknamed the Strike Squad, needed only a point against USA and were heavy favourites but everything about their matchday preparation was disastrous.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d4f9d29cb37c43e0d2e38c9dfd8a9a4cfedf3bb\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434701003265/b1f953e1-f3f0-416a-91da-1db2fca095e0-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Trinidad and Tobago lost this World Cup qualifier against USA in 1989.

Jack Warner had oversold tickets for the 22,000-seat stadium.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Tiedemann/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Most famously, Warner grossly oversold tickets for the 22,000-seat National Stadium and approximately 35,000 fans squeezed into the venue while thousands more almost caused a riot outside. The Strike Squad, including an 18-year-old, Aston Villa-bound Dwight Yorke, had to be lifted over the mob by soldiers before kick-off in the biggest game of their lives.</p> \n<p>United States won 1-0 and Trinidad and Tobago players and supporters wept openly. But Warner’s rapid rise in Fifa began. The following day, according to Warner’s authorised biography, he started his campaign for the Concacaf presidency with the help of the American administrator Chuck Blazer and, later, Havelange.</p> \n<p>In Trinidad the government responded to public outrage over the game against the USA by opening a commission of inquiry into allegations of fraud over bogus match tickets and the endangerment of the lives of football fans. However, rather than sanction Warner, Havelange awarded Trinidad and Tobago a fair play award for the behaviour of fans. And Warner used that award and his promotion to the role of Concacaf president as proof he had done nothing wrong.</p> \n<p>If the world was elevating him, he argued, then why should Trinidad and Tobago try to drag him back down? And wouldn’t the republic be embarrassing itself in the process?</p> \n<p>All over the globe, he claimed, people were laughing at how those backward islands were mistreating a man of such obvious talents. The state’s commission of inquiry never officially ended but Justice Lionel Seemungal was starved of resources. The inquiry paused and was never resumed.</p> \n<p>It was the closest Warner ever came to justice in his homeland.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"14e4e43abb581dd6f567a5d31b296d1853a2f7b2\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/19/1434701302002/4bf3eb20-621e-4429-ae39-49091bc25f35-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Chuck Blazer, left, and Jack Warner are accused by US prosecutors of carving up more than $150m in bribes between themselves and their associates.

But Warner, a former history teacher, became a multimillionaire while Blazer infamously rented an apartment in Trump Tower for his cats.</p> \n<p>Havelange gave Warner the World Cup’s television rights for the Caribbean <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2011/dec/29/jack-warner-sepp-blatter\" title=\"\">at the price of only $1</a> in 1998, supposedly to raise money for the Caribbean Football Union (CFU). But when Warner left Fifa in 2011, the CFU did not even have the funds to hold an&nbsp;AGM.</p> \n<p>The Trinidad and Tobago FA was also more than $7m in debt and its financial documents suggested that millions of dollars of sponsorship money and Fifa aid were <a href=\"http://wired868.com/2012/02/17/ttff-to-sue-warner-today/\" title=\"\">diverted into Warner‑owned accounts</a> and businesses. And the Caribbean, which provided half of Concacaf’s top six teams in the 1974 World Cup qualifiers, with Haiti, Trinidad and Tobago and the Netherlands Antilles in first, second and sixth place respectively, became the confederation’s whipping boys after the formation of the CFU.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6df32f1fc81ee755c68d69f386df310f58e921d\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636011017/35965141-cf40-4dd4-87e2-8acdbbb2a8fa-356x420.jpeg\" alt=\"Jack Warner leaves the Arouca police station in East Trinidad on 15 June.\" width=\"356\" height=\"420\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jack Warner leaves the Arouca police station in East Trinidad on 15 June.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea de Silva/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Although Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica qualified once each – thanks to expanded World Cup tournaments – the Caribbean teams became largely also‑rans on the football field, even as their administrators grew richer every year.</p> \n<p>Fifa did not only turn a blind eye. The South Africa 2010 World Cup’s local organising committee’s $10m payment, through the global body to Warner’s phantom Diaspora Legacy Programme, suggested the Trinidadian found willing accomplices in Fifa’s executive committee, who allowed the misuse of funds ostensibly meant to develop the Caribbean. South Africa’s government and football federation have denied the payment was a bribe.</p> \n<p>The money, according to the US indictment, was funnelled to Warner’s Republic Bank accounts in Trinidad in three tranches from Fifa, via a Bank of America account in New York.</p> \n<p>From the largesse, a Trinidad Express investigation claimed, Warner laundered more than $5m through unwitting, legitimate Trinidad-owned businesses including JTA Group and International Shipping Limited (ISL). The JTA Group, ISL and Warner shared the same accounting firm that sometimes did Concacaf’s and the Trinidad and Tobago FA’s books.</p> \n<p>Carl Mack, owner and director of the JTA Group, told the Trinidad Express that foreign currency purchases had been made from Warner by the accounting firm and the requisite source of funds declarations were made in each case.</p> \n<p>ISL’s financial controller, Rishi‑Nirvan Balroop, said the company had bought US dollars, dealing only with the same accountants, and added: “At no point was ISL ever in a position to investigate or suspect the source of these funds and we discharged our responsibilities in accordance with industry norms and standards.”</p> \n<p>Warner reportedly used more than $2m to clear off credit card debts and another $236,000 to repay a loan. The rest was funnelled through several Warner-owned companies and accounts.</p> \n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.justice.gov/opa/file/450211/download\" title=\"\">US indictments state</a> Warner promised Blazer a $1m cut but paid him only $750,000. There was never a surfeit of honour within this bunch of goodfellas.</p> \n<p>How many other nations danced to Warner’s crooked tune and helped him to keep his credit cards plump?</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c757181d3173e2a4df047e85d4c6ed4dad676a5\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/18/1434636095443/5eff44f2-fac1-4e62-a3ed-f178502c45d6-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"David Beckham and Jack Warner speak to the media at the launch of the David Beckham Academy at Marvin Lee Stadium in Macoya in September 2010.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Beckham and Jack Warner speak to the media at the launch of the David Beckham Academy at Marvin Lee Stadium in Macoya in September 2010.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrea De Silva/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Five years ago England’s 2018 World Cup bid team seemed to get uncomfortable when I asked for the cost of their six-day football camp at the Centre of Excellence in Trinidad.</p> \n<p>“That is for David Beckham to answer,” said the bid team’s chief executive, Andy Anson, before promptly ending his media chat. “The cost is irrelevant,” said Phil Mepham, the media coordinator for the 2018 bid. “We are not getting into that.”</p> \n<p>“I don’t know how much it costs but as long as the kids are happy,” said Beckham. “Hopefully if we do get the World Cup, it would continue.”</p> \n<p>Fifa’s rules of conduct at the time forbade bidding teams from not only monetary gifts but also “any benefit, opportunity, promise, remuneration or service to any of such individuals, in connection with the bidding process”. It might have been worse for England, of course. Warner initially asked the FA’s bid team to send the Queen.</p> \n<p>In Trinidad, Warner’s fortunes, by then, seemed hopelessly intermingled with some of society’s most influential figures. This is unsurprising when you consider that one man was allegedly laundering millions of dollars into a country with the population of Birmingham.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/31/ex-fifa-vice-president-jack-warner-swallows-onion-spoof\">Ex-Fifa vice president Jack Warner swallows Onion spoof</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“Mr Warner has been a friend of mine for many years,” Joseph Harris told the Trinidad Newsday. “I have never been a fair-weather friend … As a Catholic and a Christian you have to follow the example of Jesus Christ.”</p> \n<p>Joseph Harris, in case you are wondering, is Trinidad and Tobago’s Roman Catholic archbishop.</p> \n<p>“Mr Warner may have donated money to individual parishes and I cannot keep tabs on all of that,” said Harris. “I suppose he did … I don’t know that it was tainted money that he gave to the church. We do not go behind every donation.”</p> \n<p>Fortunately, the US Department of Justice appears not to be as nonchalant about dirty money.
