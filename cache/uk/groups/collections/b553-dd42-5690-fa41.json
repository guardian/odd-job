A bid of around &pound;20m may be enough for the club to consider allowing Dzeko to depart.</p> \n<p>Despite agreeing a fresh four-year deal last August the Bosnian again struggled to establish himself as first choice under Manuel Pellegrini last season. This has proved the pattern of his City career since joining from Wolfsburg in 2011 when Roberto Mancini was in charge.</p> \n<p>The forward was unable to score consistently, enjoying only patches of his best form until the second part of the 2013-14 campaign when he scored 11 of his 16 league goals from late January onwards as the club won a second championship in three years.</p> \n<p>On signing new terms last summer, Dzeko said: “I’m really happy here at City, it’s a second home to me, so it was an easy decision to stay for the long term. I knew from the beginning when I started here that I wanted to stay for a long time – I can’t see any place better than here.”</p> \n<p>However he managed only four league goals despite starting 22 games last season.

The reality, though, is that because Southampton lack the will of Alderweireld, it is impractical for them to force him to come to them. Les Reed, Southampton’s executive director, is instead in negotiations with Atl&eacute;tico over a settlement that relates to the €2m non-payment.</p> \n<p>Tottenham say that Atl&eacute;tico promised they have the authority to sell Alderweireld to whomever they choose and they have treated the pledge in good faith, moving quickly to close their side of the deal. They consider the argument between Atl&eacute;tico and Southampton to be nothing to do with them.</p> \n<p>Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham manager, has overhauled his options at the back and Alderweireld stands to become his third signing of the summer, following the centre-half <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/29/tottenham-sign-kevin-wimmer-fc-koln\" title=\"\">Kevin Wimmer for €6m from Cologne </a>and the right-back <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/19/tottenham-sign-kieran-trippier-burnley\" title=\"\">Kieran Trippier for &pound;3.5m</a> from Burnley.</p> \n<p>Alderweireld is attracted by the prospect of partnering his international teammate Jan Vertonghen in central defence – the pair currently occupy the full-back positions for Belgium, with Alderweireld on the right and Vertonghen on the left.</p> \n<p>Alderweireld is grateful to Southampton, where he thrived after a difficult season at Atl&eacute;tico, but he considers Tottenham to be the surer bet for regular European football.

It stung. Badly.</p> \n<p>The City Football Group, Manchester City’s all encompassing attempt to attain global recognition, decreed the former England midfielder would initially spend six months in the Premier League before, predictably, reneging and deciding to keep him until the end of the season.</p> \n<p>Cue anger and vitriol. Yet as the Englishman’s second coming took place here in midtown Manhattan on Tuesday, all the talk was of moving purposefully forward rather than agonizingly looking back.</p> \n<p>The city boy already appears enraptured with the Big Apple – “I love the sounds, the buzz” - and when he makes his debut on Sunday at the fabled Yankee Stadium, his love affair will deepen.</p> \n<p>Yes, there are regrets at what happened the first time around. But now the slate is clean.</p> \n<p>Lampard looked enthused about the opportunity to play with David Villa and Italian veteran Andrea Pirlo who will commence playing once his visa is ratified on 21 July. Highly rated City youngster Angelino was also presented here along with Athletic Bilbao defender Andoni Iraola.</p> \n<p>NYC FC have been wildly inconsistent yet a push for the play-offs remains a serious possibility.</p> \n<p>So was there an element of debt to repay to those who bought season tickets in the hope of seeing Chelsea’s record goalscorer start from the off in March?</p> \n<p>“I have always been so determined and had moments of decision in my career and I have learned the only way to answer those questions is on the pitch, that’s where I am ready to give all my answers,” he said.</p> \n<p>“I was frustrated during the initial time last year when I stayed in Manchester but it’s hard to look back negatively. I just want to start here and do my bit. It wasn’t an easy position to be in.</p> \n<p>“The way I have been received with the people in the streets has been very positive, if there is a debt I will answer everything on the pitch. It wasn’t an easy position for me to be in.</p> \n<p>“I am ready now though. My fitness is good, it is a mini pre-season for me, I am doing everything I can to get to peak fitness straight away. They are world class players here like David Villa and Andrea Pirlo. I am used to playing with top players so I can deal with everything here. You have to thrive on pressure.”</p> \n<p>The irony that Steve Gerrard, his former England team-mate and sparring partner in the Premier League, was going through the same media motions on the west coast was not lost on Lampard.</p> \n<p>They will meet for the first time on 23 August in Los Angeles - a date which is already in his diary.</p> \n<p>“I played against Steven so many times, it’s great that he is in MLS. As soon as I saw that date I penciled it in and I can’t wait,” he added.</p> \n<p>“After all those times playing for England with him and against him for Chelsea, I never envisaged this would happen. But I am pleased it has.”</p> \n<p>Lampard’s father, Frank Sr arrives on Wednesday with other members of his family though the midfielder scoffs at suggestions his 18-month stay in the Big Apple will resemble an extended city break.</p> \n<p>“My friends seem to think I am holiday but I have a job to do,” he added. “I have been watching a lot of the games in MLS and really cannot wait to get started. To have the chance of playing with players like Pirlo and Villa at this point of my career is fantastic.”</p> \n<p>“I have got to know David pretty well over the years and we are good friends. He’s won everything and it’s a huge signal we have players like him at the club. </p> \n<p>“The relationships are there. We are not doing as well as we wanted to. Starting off as new isn’t easy but there has been an improvement recently. There has been progress and I have no fears.”</p> \n<p>Is there anything which does worry a player who always seems to exude positivity ?</p> \n<p> “Well, I’ve not done the subway yet,” he said with a smile. “It’s too big to take it all in. And driving a car has been interesting too, I tried that for the first time the other day and think I did OK.</p> \n<p>“But all the sounds and the buzz suits me just right.” </p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/608ad51a9156f5b7341737ad1ec6aaeea71f436a/0_89_3300_1981/3300.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1981,"width":3300,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Craig Ruttle/AP","altText":"Frank Lampard","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Craig Ruttle/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-07T22:06:49Z","lastModified":"2015-07-07T22:42:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Steve Brenner","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/steve-brenner"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Frank Lampard","New York City FC","Football","Sport","US sports","MLS","Manchester City"],"tags":[{"id":"football/frank-lampard","webTitle":"Frank Lampard"},{"id":"football/new-york-city-fc","webTitle":"New York City FC"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"football/mls","webTitle":"MLS"},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Steve Brenner","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/steve-brenner"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/07/frank-lampard-feels-fantastic-at-his-second-coming-for-new-york-city-fc","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4aeqx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jul/07/frank-lampard-feels-fantastic-at-his-second-coming-for-new-york-city-fc","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/07/frank-lampard-feels-fantastic-at-his-second-coming-for-new-york-city-fc"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/608ad51a9156f5b7341737ad1ec6aaeea71f436a/0_89_3300_1981/3300.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1981,"width":3300,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Frank Lampard’s arrival in New York comes later than expected.

The 29-year-old worked with Alan Pardew during a successful stint at Newcastle and is attracted to the idea of joining his former manager, though it is understood he is also seeking evidence of Palace’s ambition, particularly in the transfer market.</p> \n<p>The midfielder would be the club’s first addition during the summer window, with Palace’s moves into the market to date limited to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/brede-hangeland-one-year-contract-crystal-palace\" title=\"\">securing Brede Hangeland</a> on a one-year deal and tying down James McArthur to new terms.</p> \n<p>They have expressed interest in a number of players, from Chelsea’s Lo&iuml;c R&eacute;my to Matt Phillips and Charlie Austin at Queens Park Rangers, but Parish admitted over the weekend that securing personnel aimed at consolidating last season’s 10th-place finish – the joint second-highest in the club’s history – represented uncharted territory for the owners.</p> \n<p>“Yohan Cabaye is definitely one we’d like to do,” the co-chairman <a href=\"http://talksport.com/football/exclusive-crystal-palace-are-working-deal-psg-star-yohan-cabaye-confirms-eagles-chief\" title=\"\">told TalkSport</a>. “It would be a massive thing for the club because he’s a seasoned international. But getting the top players is difficult. It’s a difficult transfer market right now. It’s a bit blocked up, no one really wants to go first, no one wants to set the valuation. We’ve finished 10th, we’ve done well but we want to do better than that. For us to get into the top 10 in the Premier League, we’ve got to be bringing in people that are top-10 Premier League players. It’s not easy, because everyone wants those players.”</p> \n<p>Cabaye flourished under Pardew on Tyneside after a move from Lille in 2011 before <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jan/29/psg-yohan-cabaye-newcastle\" title=\"\">signing for PSG</a> for &pound;19m in January 2014. He started only 13 Ligue 1 games last season and grew concerned over a lack of first-team opportunities, which will affect his chances of making Didier Deschamps’ national squad for next summer’s European Championship in his homeland.</p> \n<p>Those frustrations were made clear to the PSG manager, Laurent Blanc, and the club have indicated a willingness to sel, not least because Uefa have relaxed their financial fair play restrictions on the Parc des Princes club, allowing them to re-enter the market more proactively to add to their ranks.</p> \n<p>West Ham United, who can offer Europa League football, have also checked on Cabaye’s availability and could yet declare an interest. Roma, too, are considering a move for him. The Italian club, who will play in the Champions League, are overseen by another of the Frenchman’s former managers, Rudi Garcia, who was formerly at Lille.</p> \n<p>McArthur, a &pound;6m signing from Wigan last summer, signed a three-year deal at Palace on Tuesday after an impressive first season. “I’m delighted,” said the Scotland international. “I had a fantastic time last year and I think the club’s going in a great direction. Everyone’s positive around the place and I’m really looking forward to the coming years. I think there was a bit of general interest [in me] but Palace is where I want to be, I’m happy and that’s the main thing in football. The club has got the potential to go places.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/7/1436283234154/Yohan-Cabaye-007.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Yohan Cabaye started only 13 league matches for PSG last season and is considering whether to join Crystal Palace.
