Milner, who will wear the No7 jersey at Anfield, turned his back on Champions League football with the deposed Premier League champions plus a more lucrative contract extension at the Etihad Stadium to become Liverpool’s first summer signing on a &pound;150,000-a-week deal.</p> \n<p>Milner agreed to the Anfield move after being assured Rodgers would remain Liverpool manager following an end-of-season review conducted by the club’s owner, Fenway Sports Group. And the 29-year-old has admitted he was convinced to leave City by Rodgers’ willingness to hand him the central position that Roberto Mancini and Manuel Pellegrini could not offer on a regular basis at the Eithad.</p> \n<p>“City are a great club and I had five great years there and enjoyed every minute,” said the former Leeds United, Newcastle United and Aston Villa midfielder. “The fans were brilliant with me the whole time there, and that made the decision difficult.</p> \n<p>“I was lucky enough to win trophies and be part of a good squad there but, speaking to the club about what their plans were and where they saw me over the next few years at the club, and then speaking to the manager here and his plans going forward and for myself, I just thought it was the right thing for me to hopefully go and get more game time and be part of something special.</p> \n<p>“I want to play football and play more centrally if I can – and that’s where the manager said he sees me playing. That’s a big thing for me coming to the later stages of my career. I want to play as much football as I can. When I’m sat at 45 and retired, I want to look back and see what I’ve done and that I’ve played games, rather than having come to the end of my career and tailed off.”</p> \n<p>Rodgers wanted to sign Milner last summer when he first rejected City’s offer of a contract extension worth up to &pound;165,000-a-week. The midfielder’s decision to join Liverpool in principle was announced after the manager had survived FSG’s inquest into last season’s poor sixth-placed finish in the Premier League. Milner says Rodgers was another telling factor in the transfer.</p> \n<p>The midfielder added: “He was a massive part, to be honest. The club doesn’t need a lot of selling about what a great club it is, with all the history, the support and the squad they have. But speaking to the manager and what his plans were for me, things I’ve heard about him from other players – I was speaking to Stevie[Gerrard] at England and people like that – and what he said to me made me want to come and play for him straight away.”</p> \n<p>Milner was followed into Anfield by Danny Ings and it appears increasingly likely that an independent tribunal will have to decide on the transfer fee payable to Burnley for their former striker. Liverpool and the Turf Moor club remain poles apart in their valuation of the England Under-21 international.Burnley want almost double the &pound;5m that the Premier League side are prepared to pay.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436218077023/James-Milner-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"James Milner will wear No7 shirt at Liverpool after being unveiled officially on Monday.

The additional overhaul of the coaching staff is intended to lead Liverpool in “a new technical direction”, according to Brendan Rodgers, although it signals not so much a revolution as continued backing for the manager’s judgment at Anfield.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/liverpool-appoint-sean-odriscoll-assistant-manager\">Liverpool appoint Sean O’Driscoll as their assistant manager</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Sean O’Driscoll <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/liverpool-appoint-sean-odriscoll-assistant-manager\" title=\"\">was confirmed as Liverpool’s assistant manager</a> on Monday having finalised his departure from the Football Association. The 58-year-old spent the past nine months as the head coach of England’s Under-19 team and replaces Colin Pascoe, sacked last month <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/05/mike-marsh-liverpool-first-team-coach\" title=\"\">following FSG’s review</a> into last season’s domestic and European disappointments. He and Rodgers are joined by the highly regarded Pepijn Lijnders, promoted from Liverpool under-16s to the newly created position of first team development coach. A new first-team coach, possibly one with connections to the club, is also being sought to replace Mike Marsh, who was released on the expiry of his contract last month.</p> \n<p>The appointment of O’Driscoll and elevation of Lijnders banishes one of many uncertainties that surrounds Liverpool. Rather than being left isolated or undermined by the departures of Pascoe and Marsh, two close allies he described as “absolutely critical” to 2014’s title challenge, Rodgers received the full support of his employer to instigate the restructuring. He could not have accepted anything less before a critical season in his Liverpool reign.</p> \n<p>O’Driscoll, the former Bournemouth, Doncaster Rovers, Crawley Town, Nottingham Forest and Bristol City manager, has attended several of Rodgers’ coaching sessions at Melwood in recent seasons. He was the first manager Rodgers faced at Vicarage Road after he left Chelsea’s coaching team to take charge of Watford in November 2008. The two have remained in regular contact since that 1-1 draw with O’Driscoll’s admired Doncaster team.</p> \n<p>“I have made these appointments because I want to take us in a new technical direction, in terms of coaching,” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/liverpool-appoint-sean-odriscoll-assistant-manager\" title=\"\">Rodgers said</a>. “I believe the entire first-team set-up will benefit and I am extremely positive and excited about what we can achieve, as a group, going forward.”</p> \n<p>He described O’Driscoll as “one of the best coaches I have ever come across” in a wide-ranging critique of English coaching <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/437773/Liverpool-manager-Brendan-Rodgers-slams-coaches-for-stifling-young-talent\" title=\"\">methods in October 2013</a>. On Monday he added: “My admiration for Sean, as a professional, is well documented. He is someone with a clear vision and philosophy and has proved he has the ability to transfer that knowledge, through his coaching, to the players. I am looking forward to working with him and also learning from his experiences and gaining valuable knowledge from his expertise.”</p> \n<p>O’Driscoll’s emergence as the favoured candidate raised many an eyebrow given his lack of experience at Premier League level, something Pascoe and Marsh possessed in abundance by comparison, plus the rival names linked with the post. There was a clamour for change at the top following the dismal end to last season and while it has arrived in personnel, the coaching philosophy in place appears more unified than ever.</p> \n<p>The 32-year-old Lijnders arrived at Liverpool’s academy only last year but made a major impression on players and fellow coaches. The Dutchman was in his early 20s when lured from PSV Eindhoven by Porto, where he progressed from coaching the club’s under-sixes to the first team. The career path of a coach who excels at one-to-one tuition is following a similar upward trajectory on Merseyside. With Rodgers and O’Driscoll he shares a common belief in a high-pressing, fluid attacking game, in the constant development of an individual’s technique and faith in young talent.</p> \n<p>“I couldn’t think of a better attacking manager to assist,” said Lijnders on his promotion. “Everybody knows how I feel about representing this amazing club. The owners have a clear and strong philosophy which is based on developing top young players into elite – I want to thank them for giving me this opportunity.”</p> \n<p>Gareth Roberts, the former Wales international, played for O’Driscoll at Doncaster and is intrigued by his former manager’s switch from the FA. He said: “It will be fascinating to see how he works with top-flight players in the Premier League, both in terms of improving the Liverpool lads and in finding the weaknesses of the opposition.</p> \n<p>“He’s a No2 this time and has always been a manager in the past but he and Brendan Rodgers seem to share a similar philosophy about the way the game should be played.”</p> \n<p>The former Anfield favourite <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/08/sami-hyppia-coaching-role-liverpool\" title=\"\">Sami Hyypia was keen to replace Pascoe</a> while Rafael Ben&iacute;tez’s former assistant Pako Ayestar&aacute;n was also linked. Both were overlooked for the assistant manager’s post but Rodgers hopes to appoint a former Liverpool old boy as first-team coach. According to Roberts, they will work alongside a meticulous operator in O’Driscoll.</p> \n<p>“He was the best manager I played for, and I played under quite a few,” said the 37-year-old former Liverpool trainee, who made over 150 appearances for Doncaster during O’Driscoll’s tenure and also played for Tranmere Rovers, Derby County, Bury, Notts County and Chester before joining Stockport County this summer.</p> \n<p>“There is no doubt he made me a better player. He’s different class on the training ground. He makes you think at every stage of a training session. Everything he does is designed to make you think, to improve you as a player and to improve you as a person. The sessions are always plotted through the week with a focus on the match at the weekend. He tailors what you do to focus on the weak points of the opposition on a Saturday.</p> \n<p>“He is very good at seeing things from the side of the pitch, tweaking players or tweaking the way players are doing things. He’s very good at changing or adjusting tactical systems. It’s something he practices with the players on the training ground. Players respond to him. He is very quietly spoken and when he raises his voice you listen. He’s very calm. He wants to get his point over. If someone is not getting what he is after, he will work with them until they see it.”</p> \n<p>Roberts added that “everything has to be done for a reason” with O’Driscoll, a coach he claims “is always doing things to make you think”.</p> \n<p>The former Wales left-back explained: “He would split the group of players into two teams and call one person from each side over to tell the rules of the game about to be played. Then he would tell them they have 30 seconds to tell the rest of the team the rules before the match started. It was all about developing communication skills among the players, making them better at passing information on to each other on the pitch. He’s a top guy and he deserves this chance.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436188796745/Sean-ODriscoll-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sean O'Driscoll has attended several of Brendan Rodgers' coaching sessions at Liverpool's Melwood training ground in recent seasons.

The people who decided this should also take responsibility,” Blatter was quoted as saying.</p> \n<p>“Messrs Sarkozy and Wulff tried to influence their voting representatives. That’s why we now have a World Cup in Qatar,” Those who decided it should take responsibility for it,” said Blatter, who added he was tired of taking the blame for something he had no control over.</p> \n<p>“I act on the leadership principal. If a majority of the executive committee wants a World Cup in Qatar then I have to accept that,” Blatter said.</p> \n<p>He suggested that the German football federation (DFB) received a recommendation from Wulff “to vote for Qatar out of economic interests”.</p> \n<p>The former DFB president Theo Zwanziger wrote in his book that Wulff had asked about Qatar’s chances but he denied it had had any influence. Beckenbauer, an executive committee member at the time, has never indicated which country he voted for.</p> \n<p>It has long been claimed that Sarkozy leaned on Michel Platini, the Uefa president, to back Qatar in order to boost French trade links with the tiny Gulf state. But Platini has always insisted the decision was his alone and also denied any link with his son getting a job with a Qatar-owned sportswear firm.</p> \n<p>Blatter has repeatedly referred to the European vote winning the day for Qatar in a bid to put pressure on the Uefa lobby that opposed his re-election. What is undeniable is that it was European votes that helped Qatar defeat the USA in the final round of voting and that Sarkozy subsequently travelled to Doha to call for the World Cup to be moved to winter.</p> \n<p>A combative Blatter also refused to accept any responsibility over the mistreatment of migrant workers in Qatar.</p> \n<p>“Look at the German companies!” he said before naming railway and construction firms. “Deutsche Bahn, Hochtief and many more had projects in Qatar even before the World Cup was awarded.”</p> \n<p>And although Fifa insiders have moved to try and quell suggestions that he may try and stay on as president, Blatter left no doubt that he was trying to engineer a succession.</p> \n<p>“I’m there now to fight. Not for myself but for Fifa,” said Blatter, who added he was on the right path and had no doubts. “Self-doubt is a leader’s greatest enemy.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/7/6/1436222097170/Harold-Mayne-Nicholls-Fif-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chief FIFA inspector, Harold Mayne-Nicholls, has been banned for seven years by Fifa's ethics committee.

She knew USA were going to beat Japan in the final and hoist the Women’s World Cup trophy for the first time in 16 years.</p> \n<p>She could have never predicted <em>how</em> it would happen, though. “I let myself go there – I envisioned us lifting the trophy,” Ellis said. “Five goals is kind of a dream come true.”</p> \n<p>It was a match that felt like a wild ride, but it also felt over from about the 16th minute, when the Americans went up 4-0 and Carli Lloyd already had a hat-trick.</p> \n<p>Over the course of seven games, the Americans found their way to a record third Women’s World Cup, casting Japan aside 5-2, and facing more adversity in the earlier stages of the tournament. Here are the key factors in the US’s remarkable victory. </p> \n<h2><strong>Set pieces were Japan’s undoing</strong></h2> \n<p>The Japanese team doesn’t have quite as much height as the Americans do. There was every reason to believe the Americans would try to put the ball in the air and hope to find an American head.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/usa-womens-world-cup-champions-japan\">Women's World Cup final match report | USA 5-2 Japan</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>But they instead decided to fake Japan out with low, driven corner kicks to players’ feet, rather than their heads. It seemed like a counterintuitive choice – until it worked. Twice.</p> \n<p>Forward Alex Morgan said the team practiced those specific tactics the day before the match. Ellis credited her assistant coach, Tony Gustavsson, with being the mastermind behind USA’s set pieces.</p> \n<p>Japanese players said they weren’t expecting the way Americans approached the set plays. “They tried new things and set plays that we hadn’t seen before in the tournament, and we didn’t handle it well,” Japan forward Yuki Ogimi said after the game. </p> \n<p>Carli Lloyd scored twice on set pieces in quick succession, and with a two-goal deficit in the opening stages, Japan never really got a chance to play the game they wanted. </p> \n<h2><strong>The USA back line finally faltered</strong></h2> \n<p>They were the big difference between 2011 to 2015. The Americans went into Sunday’s final with a whopping 513 minutes without conceding a goal, whereas in 2011, the Americans conceded five in their three games heading into the final against Japan.</p> \n<p>But for a back line that looked so solid for so long, they had a pretty difficult day. Julie Johnston, who had been nominated for the Golden Ball for a stellar start to the tournament at center-back, scored an own-goal and looked shakier as the stakes got higher in the tournament.</p> \n<p>After that shocking early surge of USA goals in the final, the match was a much closer affair than the scoreline suggested. <br /></p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/06/the-americans-fans-believed-usa-would-win\">The fans believed USA would win –&nbsp;and for a day, Vancouver belonged to the US</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Earlier in the tournament, Ellis quipped that if USA never concede, they “have a hell of a chance” to win. But with a somewhat sloppy performance at the back, USA went back to a more familiar way of doing things: relying on a load of goals to get them through.</p> \n<h2><strong>A blessing in disguise</strong></h2> \n<p>What if Megan Rapinoe and Lauren Holiday hadn’t missed the quarter-final through suspension? What if Ellis hadn’t changed her lineup or her formation?</p> \n<p>The Americans may not have made it to the final.</p> \n<p>In response to losing a suspended Holiday, Ellis put Morgan Brian in her spot, asked her to do dirty defensive work, and let Lloyd primarily focus on attacking. Ellis didn’t change her formation by that point, but Brian was a revelation in the role and it forced Ellis to find a way to play Brian, Lloyd and Holiday together once Holiday’s suspension ended.</p> \n<p>Ellis changed her formation for USA’s crucial semi-final against No 1-ranked Germany to one that included more central midfielders. The result was the best soccer the Americans had played all tournament as they were able to connect passes up the field and hold possession – two things that didn’t come easy earlier in the tournament.</p> \n<p>It’s unclear how much of Ellis’s changes were the result of recognizing the problems with the midfield. Whatever role the suspensions of Holiday and Rapinoe played is important though, no matter how small.</p> \n<p>Any team that wins a world championship needs a little luck along the way. In USA’s case, it may have been disguised as bad luck.</p> \n<h2><strong>Unleashing Carli Lloyd was crucial</strong></h2> \n<p>Things weren’t going that well for the Americans in Canada at first. They weren’t losing games, but when the players came out to talk to reporters, their shoulders were slumped and they seemed hesitant to answer questions.</p> \n<p>Why weren’t USA scoring more goals? Why weren’t USA holding possession better? How could they possibly hope to beat a team like Japan?</p> \n<p>Lloyd met with USA coach Ellis after the group stage to talk about her role. Lloyd didn’t think she was being used correctly. </p> \n<p>“She was like: ‘Don’t stress it. We’re going to find a way to get you going.’ As a player, you want to have an impact, but I knew my time was going to come,” Lloyd said.</p> \n<p>What that meant was Ellis simply gave Lloyd all that she has ever wanted: free rein to go for goal.</p> \n<p>Lloyd has been forced to play a defensive midfielder before – that was her position in the 2012 Olympics. The fact that Lloyd scored two game-winners in that tournament may be the first hint that she is suited for a more advanced role</p> \n<p>Lloyd has never looked all that interested in purely defensive work. She’ll do a passable job at it, but she’ll also end up floating toward goal.</p> \n<p>Ellis said she saw Lloyd looked poised for goals in Canada and adjusted accordingly. “When you go through a seven-game tournament, there’s peaks and valleys. Players get hot and you’ve got to ride the players that get hot,” Ellis said. “With Carli and the attacking part of her game, she was doing tremendously well so it was a natural decision for me to push her into a higher position.”</p> \n<p>It was a decision that would seal World Cup victory.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436194856883/e160ac06-4ee4-4c6e-b561-0cdbc2b874a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"USa celebrate","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Franck Fife/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-06T15:02:05Z","lastModified":"2015-07-06T15:30:15Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":142,"contributors":[{"name":"Caitlin Murray","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caitlin-murray"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["USA women's football team","Women's World Cup 2015","Women's football","Football","US sports","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/usa-womens-football-team","webTitle":"USA women's football team"},{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caitlin Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/caitlin-murray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jul/06/unleashing-carli-lloyd-and-lucky-yellow-cards-how-usa-won-the-world-cup","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4adj5","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/blog/2015/jul/06/unleashing-carli-lloyd-and-lucky-yellow-cards-how-usa-won-the-world-cup","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/06/unleashing-carli-lloyd-and-lucky-yellow-cards-how-usa-won-the-world-cup"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436194856883/e160ac06-4ee4-4c6e-b561-0cdbc2b874a2-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"USA won a record third World Cup title in Vancouver.

Sampson was happy to remain in the background, a slight and barely conspicuous figure alongside the bright white shirts of his players, who chatted politely before slipping away.</p> \n<p>For Williams and her team-mates there was a chance to put into words the thoughts that had crystallised during the journey across the Atlantic. Most of the side will return to Women’s Super League as early as this weekend and with time off not even registering as an option, there was an appetite to keep the momentum rolling.</p> \n<p>“I certainly think it’s been big,” Williams said. “We haven’t achieved something like this for a long time and it means that hopefully we can really push on – media and everyone else – really trying to get the supporters to these WSL games and growing our game even more. We’ll know how much we’ve really done when it comes to those league games and we see how many turn out for us.</p> \n<p>“You’ve seen the passion we show in that shirt. We show it for club and country and we really do try to inspire young people to take up the sport. Hopefully they’ve seen that in our performances while we’ve been away, and hopefully they’ll all come out and see what we do for our clubs.”</p> \n<p>Those already familiar with Williams’ gifts will know a set-piece expert with a formidable record from the penalty spot. Her winner against Germany capped a performance of extraordinary resolve from England, who put the bizarre nature of their <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\" title=\"\">semi-final elimination</a> to one side and produced a performance bereft of nerves.</p> \n<p>“It was such a reflection on the squad, that Japan game,” she added. “They were world champions but we really did push them to the wire. We knew we could match it with the best in the world and Germany are no different. It was one of those where we knew all the facts going into the game – they were unbeaten in 20 games against us, it had been 25 years. All those things drove us on to give one more big performance because we didn’t want to come away from it on the back of a defeat.

There were many good games but to perform at your absolute best in the most important is something special. Some teams freeze at the biggest stage, Jill Ellis’s didn’t. They were superb, beating the reigning champions, Japan, 5-2.</p> \n<h2>Best match (I saw live)</h2> \n<p>England v Canada quarter-final BC Place, Vancouver. In terms of speed, tempo, skill and sheer unpredictability, the best match was the technically superior quarter-final in which Germany beat a desperately unlucky France in a penalty shootout.</p> \n<p>But, and it is a big but, there was nothing to beat the sound of 54,000 fans packing Vancouver’s BC place a long goal kick from the Pacific to cheer Canada on. The wall of noise when Christine Sinclair scored to reduce the deficit to 2-1 must surely have been heard in the United States. The atmosphere was incredible and offered proof that women’s football can provide some of the most memorable big occasions. England swiftly took a two-goal lead through Jodie Taylor and Lucy Bronze but after that it took an amalgam of the Lionesses’s sheer determination and Mark Sampson’s clever tactics to hold Canada off.</p> \n<h2>Best Goal: Mizuho Sakaguchi (for Japan against Holland)</h2> \n<p>Following a compelling preamble featuring intricate passing, a cute backheel and a clever dummy from team-mates, Mizuho Sakaguchi showed off seamless, adhesive control before curving the ball into the top corner with her left foot from the edge of the area.</p> \n<h2>Best player: Kadeisha Buchanan (Canada) </h2> \n<p>It’s impossible to pick a winner from the obvious suspects – Carli Lloyd, Amandine Henry, Aya Miama, Hope Solo et al – so I’m going for Canada’s 19-year-old central defender Kadeisha Buchanan. Watching her composure and assurance on the ball it was impossible to credit she is so young. The baby of seven sisters brought up by a single mother, much of Buchanan’s play belonged on a different planet to several team-mates. Her vision and reading of the game is so exceptional it will be intriguing to see if she ends up being relocated to central midfield. A Canada side struggling to score goals would have struggled to make the quarter-finals without her. John Herdman, their English coach, dubs her the “Christine Sinclair of my defence.” Praise does not come higher than that.</p> \n<h2>Coach: Mark Sampson (England) </h2> \n<p>The 32-year-old Welshman could not quite end “49 years of hurt” but he guided England to their first Women’s World Cup semi-final. It was also the first time an England side of either gender had got to the final four of a World Cup since 1990.</p> \n<p>There is legitimate cause for concern regarding the shortage of female coaches at Canada 2015 but Sampson deserves immense credit for camouflaging his team’s limitations with some extremely clever, seriously streetwise tactics. A coach who really does his homework also helped create an extraordinarily strong camaraderie among the Lionesses.</p> \n<h2>Best hat-trick: Carli Lloyd </h2> \n<p>It was fast, it was furious – and it was in the final. Lloyd scored in every knockout game and got six at the finals altogether. No wonder someone changed her playing position on Wikipedia to read: “President of the United States.”</p> \n<h2>Best referee: Carol Anne Chenard (Canada)</h2> \n<p>A welcome exception to some poor officiating. Refereeing needs to improve significantly before the next World Cup in France in 2019. Too many games have been blemished by baffling, blatantly incorrect decisions. The women’s game is evolving fast and it seems the officials are struggling to advance at similar pace.</p> \n<h2>Friendliest Venue: Moncton</h2> \n<p>Vancouver was more beautiful, Montreal more chic, Ottawa more interesting and Edmonton – well Edmonton had more tall buildings – but Moncton in New Brunswick was the most charming venue of Canada 2015. Virtually everyone, everywhere, was friendly but in Moncton people are super friendly. If drivers see you hesitating on the pavement (sorry, sidewalk) and think you might want to cross the road, they stop for you. It also had by far the best newspaper of any read at breakfast in the five cities I visited – so hats off to the <a href=\"https://www.telegraphjournal.com/times-transcript/\">Times and Transcript</a>.</p> \n<h2>Best quote: England’s Lucy Bronze</h2> \n<p>Bronze issued Julie-Stewart Binks, a Fox sports reporter, with a reminder of the established order of things in the Commonwealth ahead of the quarter-final with Canada “The Queen’s on the [Canadian] coin for a reason,” said England’s right-back.</p> \n<h2>Best cliche upgrade </h2> \n<p>Mark Sampson’s catchphrase was “We’re in a good place” but it upgraded to “We’re in a great place” by the semi-final. English journalists talked about having special T-shirts printed with the slogan “We’re in a good place” in order to wear them at his triumphant post-match conference, but it wasn’t to be.</p> \n<h2>Biggest Upset: Colombia 2 France 0 </h2> \n<p>A group-stage day to remember in Moncton. Colombia arrived at Canada 2015 having never scored a World Cup goal, let alone won a game in the tournament. France, though, had no answer to their counter-attacking tactics or the individual brilliance of Lady Andrade and Yoreli Rincon. In Colombia’s goal Sandra Sep&uacute;lveda played the game of her life. Admittedly the referee missed a blatant handball which should have earned France a penalty but that would have spoilt the fun.</p> \n<h2>Worst moment: Laura Bassett’s own goal</h2> \n<p>People often talk about football being a cruel game but this was particularly harsh on the Lionesses and one of their best defenders. Significantly that miscued attempted clearance was forced by an immaculate cross from Nahomi Kawasumi. It served to emphasise the enduring importance of high-calibre crossing ability.</p> \n<h2>Villains of the tournament: Fifa</h2> \n<p>They were queueing in the rain outside Moncton Stadium for England’s opening group game against France while bags and backpacks were inspected. The overriding suspicion is that it was less about security than confiscating non-Fifa branded food and beverages. Many fans attending the England v France, Colombia v Mexico double-header had come equipped with picnics and it was sad to see hampers abandoned outside as a condition of entry. Fans were instead instructed to invest their dollars on the overpriced, generally unhealthy and unappetising Fifa-branded refreshments on sale inside.</p> \n<p>If, as Moncton’s Times and Transcript pointed out, the confiscation of liquid meant shorter queues for the “Porta-Potties”, dehydration still became a real problem for journalists. No food or drink was provided for reporters inside stadiums anywhere during the tournament. If you wanted some water you had to find a vending machine supplying Fifa-branded bottles and pay for it. If you wanted chocolate you had to dream on as stadium vending machines selling non-Fifa branded confectionery had all been disabled for the duration of the tournament.</p> \n<h2>Most heartfelt social media posting</h2> \n<p>Laura Sesselman, the Canada centre-half, on Instagram in the wake of her poor display in the quarter-final against England and error which led to Jodie Taylor’s goal. Sesselman received a barrage of abuse on Twitter, Facebook <em>et al</em> and finally answered back. “Yes, I slipped, yes they scored and you can blame me all you want,” she wrote. “If it makes you feel better, fine. For all you classless people with your negativity and your threats – you know absolutely nothing.” Good for her. It needed saying.</p> \n<h2>Only real disappointment </h2> \n<p>Not being able to see more games due to the logistical difficulties of covering a tournament in a country virtually the size of Europe. England played in five of the six host cities and in four of Canada’s six distinct time zones, traversing the country from Moncton near the Atlantic coast to Vancouver on the Pacific.</p> \n<h2>Biggest shock</h2> \n<p>Boarding a five-and-a-half hour flight from Ottawa to Vancouver and noting that the Canadians on the plane treated it as a short hop.</p> \n<h2>Best place visited</h2> \n<p>Sunset Beach, Vancouver. Redefined the phrase “unparalleled natural beauty”.</p> \n<h2>Best moment </h2> \n<p>Lucy Bronze’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLSG6jFjlSc\">spectacular long-range goal in the round of 16 against Norway</a> which secured England’s quarter-final place – and meant they had finally managed to win a knock out game at a World Cup. It seemed a new “Bronze Age” really was upon us.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/7/6/1436181110439/carli-lloyd-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"USA's Carli Lloyd, right, celebrates with team-mates during their semi-final match win against Germany in Montreal.
