They came tantalisingly close, but couldn’t find the elusive winner that would have secured them a berth as one of the four best third-place teams .</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/germany-norway-womens-world-cup-last-16\">Germany and Norway qualify for last 16 at Women’s World Cup</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Rebekah Stott’s powerful right-foot finish put the Kiwis ahead after 28 minutes, the uncompromising defender lashing home from Ria Percival’s corner for New Zealand’s first goal of the tournament.</p> \n<p>They looked set to head into the break with the lead, but were hit hard by a harsh 41st minute penalty when Hungarian referee Katalin Kulcsar ruled midfielder Betsy Hassett had handled in the area. Replays showed the ball had ricocheted off her chest, but Lisi Wang converted from the spot kick to level the scores at halftime.</p> \n<p>A third change looked likely when defensive linchpin Abbey Erceg went down with an ankle injury seven minutes after the re-start, but the Kiwi skipper returned as China continued to pressure the New Zealand goal.</p> \n<p>They were rewarded as the 60-minute mark ticked over, Kiwi keeper Erin Nayler slightly slow off her line and Shanshan Wang climbing high to head home and grab the lead.</p> \n<p>The New Zealanders continued to push forward, snatching the equaliser barely four minutes later. Ali Riley, who had constantly threatened down the left, capitalised on the extra space with a tantalising cross which Amber Hearn nodded back for Hannah Wilkinson to slam home.</p> \n<p>Although they pushed hard into injury-time, the Ferns couldn’t find the winner which would have put them into the knockout phase for the first time.</p> \n<p>Coach Tony Readings said that while the result was disappointing, he couldn’t be prouder of his team. “We knew we had to come here and score goals, and we got a couple. I think we were the better team - we created more chances, but we were on the end of a referee’s decision that hasn’t gone our way for the second time in three games.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/20c7138d37221482fff13ad147af471b3cc799fb/0_0_2700_1620/2700.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1620,"width":2700,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"John Woods/AP","altText":"New Zealand v China","cleanCredit":"Photograph: John Woods/AP"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-16T02:55:17Z","lastModified":"2015-06-16T07:34:32Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":16,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Women's World Cup 2015","Women's football","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/nz-football-ferns-out-of-world-cup","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49ztv","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/16/nz-football-ferns-out-of-world-cup","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/16/nz-football-ferns-out-of-world-cup"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/20c7138d37221482fff13ad147af471b3cc799fb/0_0_2700_1620/2700.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1620,"width":2700,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"China’s goalkeeper Fei Wang saves from a New Zealand corner during FIFA Women’s World Cup second half soccer action in Winnipeg, Canada.

The country’s football federation is considering whether to sack him.</p> \n<p>Its acting president, Nikita Simonyan, told the R-Sport agency the federation will discuss whether to remove Capello. Russian media have reported that a clause in the Italian’s contract means the federation would have to pay &pound;15m in compensation.</p> \n<p>Mikhail Gershkovich, a former Russia assistant manager, told Moskovsky Komsomolets newspaper that Capello was unable to inject any emotion into the team and called on him to do the honourable thing and resign.</p> \n<p>“Don Fabio should awaken his conscience and leave himself. What kind of severance pay are we talking about? The team is in a dead end. The worst thing is that after every defeat Capello has a whole host of reasons to explain it, but it’s never about him. And the whole problem is with him!”</p> \n<p>A number of Russian parliamentarians have expressed disbelief at how badly the team are playing under Capello. In the past 10 competitive games, Russia have managed two victories, one against Liechtenstein and one against Montenegro, awarded after the match was abandoned because of crowd trouble.</p> \n<p>“First and foremost the coach should be ashamed after this kind of game,” said Igor Ananskikh, the chair of the Russian parliament’s sports committee. “We need to admit honestly that Capello is not for us and he can’t bring anything useful to our team. It’s time to be decisive and part company.”</p> \n<p>“If we keep playing like this, it’s probably time we ourselves offered to hand over the 2018 World Cup to someone else,” MP Igor Lebedev wrote on Twitter, parodying the calls in some quarters in the wake of the Fifa scandal to revisit the decision that gave Russia the 2018 tournament.</p> \n<p>Disdain from Russian parliamentarians is nothing new for Capello, who faced a squall of criticism after Russia’s dismal exit from the World Cup in Brazil last summer. Nationalist leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jul/02/fabio-capello-russia-world-cup\" title=\"\">called him a “thief” </a>for making off with such a big salary, and said it was hard to take Capello seriously as a football manager because he “looks like a schoolteacher”.</p> \n<p>Capello’s new contract was signed before the tournament in Brazil, and includes a hefty payment in the case of early severance. Some Russian media sources have pointed to a secret “second contract” signed by Capello in Russia. If this is proven to be true, the trainer could be fired without severance pay. Capello’s representatives have <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/03/fabio-capello-to-sue-former-russia-fa-president-nikolay-tolstykh\" title=\"\">strenuously denied any such second contract</a>.</p> \n<p>Capello’s salary has previously been in the headlines because he went several months without receiving it, with the Russian federation saying it simply <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/nov/12/fabio-capello-salary-russian-football-union\" title=\"\">could not afford to pay</a>.
