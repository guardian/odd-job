Perhaps they are too similar in character, if entirely different in managerial style.</p> \n<p>For now Strachan has usurped the man he succeeded as Celtic’s manager in 2005. When Scotland were once again weighed down by international eagerness last November, Strachan delivered a win when it mattered most in the defeat of O’Neill’s horribly agricultural side at Celtic Park. O’Neill’s team have yet to produce a result or performance that endorses the 63-year-old’s status.</p> \n<p>It was little wonder O’Neill cut such a wounded figure after Saturday’s 1-1 draw. Ireland do not create enough chances, let alone score enough goals; six Group D matches have yielded 12 goals, seven of which arrived against Gibraltar.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457155803__\n</div> \n<p>After facing Scotland the most damning indictment of O’Neill’s Ireland was that their greatest threat came from the set pieces of Robbie Brady. “We have to try to become more creative,” O’Neill said. “We have to have midfield players trying to get goals. Players have played a lot of international matches and we don’t score a lot of goals. We don’t score them.</p> \n<p>“It’s unfortunately there in black and white but we have to try and try and try to improve our chance ratio. And not just have a final 15-minute burst where you put absolutely everything in the area. You have to try to be more creative. I thought in periods when we had possession we did fine.</p> \n<p>“We kept it, it opened up and I thought Scotland were on the back foot for probably all of the first half. But what a lift they got just after half-time when they’ve scored a goal they haven’t really worked for. And of course that knocks you, particularly with the pressure on you to win.</p> \n<p>“Some midfield players I believe, attacking midfield players, should be thinking of not coming off that field without having at least three or four shots in a game. Without even thinking about it.”</p> \n<p>O’Neill has a mitigating factor – injury denied Aiden McGeady the opportunity he craved to face the nation of his birth. The blunt hosts threw on Robbie Keane and Shane Long for the closing stages but to no avail.</p> \n<div>\n __VIDEO_EMBED_gu-video-457155720__\n</div> \n<p>Ireland had Scotland rattled during a ferocious opening to this tie. Yet they could neither maintain such a pace nor combine it with progressive football. James McCarthy should have been sent off for a sneaky elbow into the face of Russell Martin and the Ireland midfielder used his lucky charm to escape an earlier caution for a deliberate foul on Scott Brown.</p> \n<p>Ireland’s goal, scored by Jon Walters, highlighted as appalling a decision as multiple officials could combine to offer. He was clearly offside and yet it was an interval lead his side merited.</p> \n<p>Scotland’s reply arrived courtesy of one of their anonymous first-half performers. Shaun Maloney, labelled the most conscientious player Strachan has worked with, was crucially assisted by John O’Shea’s back but had still offered a positive touch so desperately lacking during the previous 45 minutes.</p> \n<p>“I think the performances have exceeded my expectations,” Scotland’s manager said. “Sometimes you get through in life by scraping a goal away from home somewhere or winning a match you didn’t deserve to win. But it’s not been like that for us. I think we’ve probably taken the right amount of points but the performance levels have been magnificent.”</p> \n<p>O’Neill was pressed once more on whether Ireland’s pursuit of Jack Grealish could bear fruit, even if only to offer much-needed positivity to this campaign. “I really think you’d have to ask Jack and the family themselves,” he said.</p> \n<p>“There’s wee things we think we might be able to help along the way, but what I’ve said to him is that he’s a fairly decent chance, a better chance, of getting into our team than he would have of getting into England.”</p> \n<p><strong>Man of the match:</strong> Robbie Brady (Ireland)</p> \n<h2>Teams</h2> \n<p><strong>Republic of Ireland:</strong> Given; Coleman, Wilson, O’Shea, Brady; Walters, McCarthy, Hendrick, Whelan (McClean, 68); Hoolahan (Keane, 73); Murphy (Long, 80).</p> \n<p><strong>Subs not used:</strong> Forde, Keogh, McGeady, Meyler, Christie, Ward, Quinn, McGoldrick, Westwood.</p> \n<p><strong>Booked:</strong> McCarthy, Whelan, McClean.</p> \n<p><strong>Scotland:</strong> Marshall; Hutton, Martin, Mulgrew, Forsyth; Brown (McArthur, 85), Morrison; Ritchie (Anya h-t), Naismith (Berra, 90), Maloney; S Fletcher.</p> \n<p><strong>Subs not used:</strong> Gordon, Whittaker, D Fletcher, Adam, Greer, Robertson, Forrest, Griffiths, Samson.</p> \n<p><strong>Booked:</strong> Naismith</p> \n<p>R<strong>eferee:</strong> N Rizzoli (It)</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434292748126/James-McCarthy-James-McAr-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Ireland's James McCarthy, left, looks disconsolate as James McArthur hugs James Morrison after Scotland's 1-1 draw in Dublin.

Northern Ireland’s primary aim was to avoid defeat to keep on track for qualification – and a composed display from the stand-in goalkeeper Michael McGovern of Hamilton, winning his first competitive cap, clearly helped. They were far from graceful on Saturday, but a point against a side ranked 12th in the world, and who had only conceded a single goal in their own campaign, has to be viewed in a positive light.</p> \n<p>However, there was a sentiment that, having finished the stronger, all three points could have been claimed, particularly as Romania had to cope without five key players, including Lucian Sanmartean, the ringleader of the Irish tormentors in the previous fixture, <a href=\"http://preview.gutools.co.uk/football/2014/nov/14/romania-northern-ireland-euro-2016-qualifier-match-report\">a 2-0 win in Bucharest last November</a>.</p> \n<p>As it is, Romania remain top of the group, and with third-placed Hungary having closed the gap on the Irish to two points, following victory over Finland, there must be no hint of complacency. O’Neill possesses that vague, indefinable, managerial edge which suggests his men will maintain their collective work ethic.</p> \n<p>In real terms, Northern Ireland will be booking their tickets to France next summer if they keep their nerve and work through occasional bouts of anxiety in possession.</p> \n<p>A September double-header, away to Faroe Islands <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/14/faroes-humiliate-greece-double-euro-2016-qualifying\">who beat a self-destructive Greece</a>, and at home to the Hungarians, will be fascinating. Six much-anticipated points should suffice for a first appearance at the European finals.</p> \n<p>O’Neill said: “We have a difficult game in the Faroe Islands especially since they won against Greece so they will be buoyant, then we have a massive game against Hungary here.</p> \n<p>“I hope September puts us in a strong situation. This was always going to be a difficult game because of the scheduling and because it was Romania, but we have worked extremely hard in the six games so far.”</p> \n<p>These are strangely special, electric, times for Northern Ireland. Occasionally vulnerable on the counterattack against their opponents, this new status takes some getting used to. A forceful finish at a still under-construction Windsor Park will have pleased O’Neill though, despite a glaring miss from the in-form striker, Kyle Lafferty, the talisman of this ascendancy.</p> \n<p>“We are slightly disappointed that we didn’t take the three points,” O’Neill explained. “When we look back at it I think we will see it as a really good point.</p> \n<p>“The most pleasing thing for me was the level of desire the team showed. We contested every single ball and covered a lot of ground. We have played better in the group – there is no doubt about that – but you have to give credit to the opposition because we were playing against a good team.”</p> \n<p>With four games remaining, the worst-case scenario is surely a play-off place. “At the outset of the campaign the top three was our focus,” O’Neill said. “We are obviously in a very strong position to at least obtain that but we are at a stage that I as a manager and the players, want more than that.”</p> \n<p>The Northern Irish at least have a new handle on tetchy situations, and, in theory, the hardest fixtures are now behind them. Therefore, when Hungary check in to Belfast they can, potentially, add fluency, maximum points – and long, aching, realisation of Euro ambitions.</p> \n<p><strong>Northern Ireland </strong>McGovern, C McLaughlin, McAuley, J Evans (Cathcart 80), Brunt; Baird, Ward (C Evans 80), Davis, Norwood, Dallas; Lafferty.</p> \n<p><strong>Romania</strong> Tatarusanu, Papp, Grigore, Chiriches, Sepsi; Prepelița, Pintilli; Maxim (Tamas 88), Torje; Chipclu (Stancu 61); Keseru (Andone 72)</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/14/1434307987209/Stuart-Dallas-and-Kyle-La-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Stuart Dallas and Kyle Lafferty embrace after Northern Ireland were held to a goalless draw that their coach, Michael O'Neill, says could be a good point.
