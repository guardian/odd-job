The scheme allegedly began when Messi was a minor. Both Messi and his father have denied any wrongdoing.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/nov/21/lionel-messi-may-leave-spain-tax-barcelona-football\">Lionel Messi may leave Spain over tax jail threat</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>In October last year, Jorge Messi told Spanish radio his son had no knowledge of any such scheme. “I have always said it, he had absolutely nothing to do with it, so there is no need to talk about it,” he said. “My lawyers are dealing with this issue so it’s something with me and has nothing to do with him.”</p> \n<p>On Wednesday, the court said that while it was understandable Messi would not handle his own finances, the player should not be granted impunity because he had no knowledge of what was going on. The court stressed it was not in the position to decide whether Messi was aware of the fraud or not, <a href=\"http://elpais.com/elpais/2015/06/10/inenglish/1433935729_245719.html\" title=\"\">according El Pa&iacute;s</a>.</p> \n<p>Messi’s defence had argued the player had “never devoted a minute of his life to reading, studying or analysing” the contracts. However, judges noted Messi had ratified the contracts when he turned 18 and he was listed as the sole administrator of one of the companies.</p> \n<p>In October of last year, a court in Gava, near Barcelona, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/oct/03/lionel-messi-appeal-tax-fraud-rejected\" title=\"\">ruled the 27-year-old should face trial over the allegations</a>, regardless of whether or not he was aware of the alleged tax fraud. At the time, Messi released a statement announcing his intention to appeal against the ruling.</p> \n<p>It was this appeal that was rejected on Wednesday. Despite voluntary payments of more than €5m to Spanish tax authorities in the past year – representing the €4.1 of alleged unpaid taxes plus interest – the court said Messi and his father remain under investigation for three counts of tax fraud.</p> \n<p>The court’s decision cannot be appealed against. There is still the possibility an out-of-court settlement could be reached, but it could be complicated by the state attorney’s insistence on pushing forward with the accusations. Spain’s public prosecutor has recommended the charges be dismissed, arguing that Messi’s father was solely responsible for the family’s finances.</p> \n<p>The court decision comes only days after Barcelona clinched the treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/07/barcelona-champions-league-final-juventus-lionel-messi\" title=\"\">Champions League</a>.

Sampson said: “If you see Laura Bassett walk out of the stadium or see pictures of her you’ll see what the decision should have been. We were told before the tournament we would be protected and we’re disappointed that we haven’t been in the first game.”</p> \n<p>While he was similarly dismayed by England’s latest defeat against a side they haven’t beaten since 1974, Sampson remained determined to take positives from a reverse against a team ranked third in the world.</p> \n<p>“The result wasn’t that good, not that good at all,” he said. “But we’ll take lots of positives from the game. We restricted world-class opponents to one goal. The way the team defended, the way they managed the game was outstanding. Our goalkeeper hasn’t had to make world-class saves. We have a platform on which to build momentum. We need to tidy a few things up. But this performance shows who far we’ve come. We’ll learn a lot from it.”</p> \n<p>England only had three shots all game – with just one on target – but even that statistic refused to dampen the optimism of a coach who replaced a frequently bold approach with containment tactics and a 4-1-4-1 system.</p> \n<p>“We want to score goals and be creative,” said Sampson. “And we need to find some attacking solutions. But we have to respect our opponents. We had a first-half plan to manage the spaces where France can hurt you and I’ve never seen a full-back keep &Eacute;lodie Thomis as quiet as Claire Rafferty, ably assisted by Lucy Bronze, did at left-back. As we grow into the tournament we’ll find more rhythm.</p> \n<p>“We were disappointed to concede a goal scored during a transition when we were trying to counterattack but let’s not take away from the quality of the 20-yard finish. [Eug&eacute;nie] Le Sommer is a very good player and we’ve been punished with a great finish.</p> \n<p>“It was the first game of the tournament, it was as strong a wind as I’ve found in any international and both teams found it hard to progress up the pitch because of it. It was a game of limited chances and the wind made it very difficult. But we can improve.”</p> \n<p>Following the defeat, England’s forthcoming Group F games against Mexico in Moncton on Saturday and Colombia in Montreal next Wednesday have become all-important.</p> \n<p>Sampson said: “We’ll be prepared to face a very good Mexico team. I know my team, I know exactly how we’ll play. We’re excited and when we take on the big guns again we’ll find a way to win.”</p> \n<p>The coach also appealed for possibly underwhelmed English television audiences to “stick with us”, pointing out that England were never out of the game: “We were in it until the end. We were playing a world-class team with a very well-organised physically strong defence and they put five in midfield towards the end.</p> \n<p>“It’s disappointing because we felt we could come here and get a win but it was a high quality international. It was a strong England performance. We showed great solidarity and are in excellent physical condition.</p> \n<p>“We’ve had to answer question after question about the fitness of certain players but I think we’ve put them to bed now.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433883402315/Frances-Camille-Abily-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"France's Camille Abily, right, went unpunished after elbowing England's Laura Bassett in the face during the opening match in Group F.

On a day when the wet, windy weather proved rather too quintessentially English for the liking of Mark Sampson’s players, France also proved infuriatingly typical.</p> \n<p>England have not beaten their neighbours from across the Channel since 1974 and the slenderness of the scoreline, with the two side’s separated only by Eug&eacute;nie Le Sommer’s first-half strike, disguises the superiority of a French side now clear favourites to top Group F. Granted <em>Les Bleus</em> could have had Camille Abily sent off for a snide elbow on Laura Bassett but by then victory was all but secured.</p> \n<p>While this defeat is not exactly disastrous Sampson will be concerned by the lack of chances his team created and knows that, if they are to progress, England must up their game in subsequent group fixtures against Mexico and Colombia.</p> \n<p>The Welshman is big on surprises and true to his reputation as the great rotator of the women’s game, he chose Moncton as the venue for unveiling a brand new England formation. This 4-1-4-1 system featured Lucy Bronze, normally a right-back or central defender, stationed wide on the left of midfield, Ellen White, usually a centre forward, on the right wing and Fara Williams sitting deep in the quasi-sweeping role.</p> \n<p>Initially at least it certainly succeeded in fazing a France team deployed in characteristic 4-4-2 guise. Assiduously closed down by Sampson’s personnel, Philippe Bergeroo’s side were at first forced to resort to a series of unusually long, rather aimless, balls.</p> \n<p>If Eniola Aluko was struggling in a rather thankless lone attacking role for England, at least Jill Scott was making her presence felt in central midfield. It was largely thanks to Scott that France took time to settle into a familiar slick passing groove in front of a disappointingly small crowd in Moncton.</p> \n<p>A 13,000 sellout had been predicted but the ground looked barely half-full with locals largely opting to stay away. This bilingual city in the eastern “Maritime” Canadian province of New Brunswick had appeared the ideal venue for these teams but with dark rain clouds hovering in the humid skies and a capricious wind blowing, the residents of the French speaking suburb of Dieppe and English speaking Riverview had evidently decided to stay indoors.</p> \n<p>An initially slow start vindicated their decision but, almost imperceptibly, the entertainment value rose. As the rain shower which had greeted kick-off finally, if temporarily, cleared so France began emerging from their shells. Suddenly remembering how to retain possession, they began moving the ball around too slickly even for Scott.</p> \n<p>England’s defence received a warning when Le Sommer unleashed a left foot volley. It was deflected to safety off Alex Scott but shortly afterwards Louisa N&eacute;cib showed off a cute dummy and dispatched an awkward cross shot which had Karen Bardsley sprawling to save.</p> \n<p>Then came the sort of moment Sampson must have dreaded. Attempting to pass her way out of defence, Bassett played Katie Chapman into trouble and the midfielder swiftly conceded possession to Le Sommer. From 20 yards she proceeded to squeeze a splendid rising shot inside a post.</p> \n<p>With Scott and the outstanding Claire Rafferty in particular fighting back, all was not lost. Yet as intelligently as Rafferty, back at left-back following her recovery from a third ruptured cruciate ligament, was defending against the dangerous &Eacute;lodie Thomis her side were up against it.</p> \n<p>Although England did have one first-half scoring chance – shot wide by Chapman – they had Bardsley to thank for reacting smartly to keep Abily’s shot out.</p> \n<p>While France continued to rather hog the ball in the second half, England increasingly pacified their key players. Le Sommer, however, simply refused to be subdued and, having forced Bardsley into another decent save she soon directed a volley slightly off target.</p> \n<p>In between Gallic interchanges Scott was presented with a shooting chance but could only direct is straight at Sarah Bouhaddi, the France goalkeeper. That was a shame as with Wendie Renard excelling in central defence for her side such openings were always going to be few and far between.</p> \n<p>The moment for Sampson to switch things around had arrived and Toni Duggan came on for the selfless White.</p> \n<p>England’s coach had made much of his team’s ability to switch to Plan B mid-match and the subsequent introduction of a forward, Fran Kirby, for Alex Scott served to emphasise this.</p> \n<p>A shift to 4-3-3 ensued but England were very lucky that Abily’s menacing, seemingly goalbound volley was fortuitously deflected off course by Steph Houghton.</p> \n<p>Not that the France bench will have been too upset – it appeared that Abily had elbowed Bassett in the preamble and they were surely relieved to have escaped what could have been a red card.</p> \n<p>With Le Sommer withdrawn, France – now with five in midfield – seemed content to hold on for a deceptively narrow win. Such containment tactics can prove high risk but the only threat England could muster was a shot from Aluko which flew high and wide. It seemed entirely emblematic of their afternoon.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433876676751/Eugenie-Le-Sommer-of-Fran-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Eugenie Le Sommer of France (No9) celebrates scoring the winning goal against England in the 2015 Women's World Cup.

The move comes before a critical period in the club’s history given the move to the Olympic Stadium next year. The former Croatia manager <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/21/slaven-bilic-leave-besiktas-west-ham\" title=\"\">left Besiktas after two seasons last month</a> and marked his return to the Premier League by targeting a top-10 finish next year and, potentially, Champions League qualification in the seasons ahead.</p> \n<p>West Ham’s co-owners, David Gold and David Sullivan, will grant him the tools to meet those initial aspirations with the club’s head of recruitment, Tony Henry, actively pursuing a number of targets with R&eacute;my a potential marquee arrival. The France international, who <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/aug/31/chelsea-loic-remy-qpr-four-year-deal\" title=\"\">joined Chelsea from Queens Park Rangers</a> for &pound;8.5m last summer, started only six Premier League games as the title went to Stamford Bridge for the first time in five years and would favour greater involvement at club level next season as he attempts to secure a place in the hosts’ squad at the 2016 European Championship finals.</p> \n<p>Jos&eacute; Mourinho would be reluctant to lose a forward who he considers has a role to play in the squad but the Chelsea manager has already made clear he will not attempt to retain anyone who wishes to leave. Both Crystal Palace and Swansea City are also monitoring the 28-year-old’s situation, and would provide regular football, but West Ham would hope to offer him the most appealing salary package as one of a number of new arrivals in the close season. There was interest in Marseille’s Andr&eacute; Ayew, although he has decided to join Swansea, but the Sampdoria midfielder Pedro Obiang is expected to join for &pound;4.6m, while Bilic’s own list of favoured additions includes the Turkey internationals Gokhan Tore, formerly of Chelsea, and Olcay Sahan who both played for him at Besiktas.</p> \n<p>West Ham are also exploring the possibility of securing the teenage Croatia midfielder Alen Halilovic on a season-long loan from Barcelona, where he has featured regularly for the B side, with Bilic aware of what he is expected to produce in his new role. “My nature is very optimistic, but realistically optimistic,” he said. “I hope we’re going to achieve big things with West Ham. I’ve been in football a long time and, wherever you go, the ambition is sky high. But with West Ham, I found the ambitions to be realistic and the ambition is right: to try to be top 10, definitely, and then improve on that.</p> \n<p>“First season, if we can finish eighth, ninth or 10th then, in the space of a few seasons, with the stadium and everything – with hype, with probably a little bit more budget, with good planning and good play – nobody can stop us dreaming of European places or, if we have a brilliant season, to try to break into the Champions League places. To win a trophy, to win a cup. You have to believe in that to achieve it. It is a special club, and that made my decision quite easy, but the most important [thing] was the ambition of the club.”</p> \n<p>West Ham, who finished 12th last season, had considered a number of high-profile candidates for the role vacated by Allardyce only for their interest in the likes of Carlo Ancelotti, Unai Emery, J&uuml;rgen Klopp, Rafael Ben&iacute;tez, Michael Laudrup and Marcelo Bielsa – who is expected to remain at Marseille – to be thwarted. Bilic has emotional ties with Upton Park, stemming from his 54 appearances as a player, but needed to convince the owners and the vice-chairman, Karren Brady, that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/09/slaven-bilic-west-ham-rock-star-manager\" title=\"\">he had the necessary experience</a>to ensure the London club maintain the progress instigated by Allardyce.</p> \n<p>While he excelled with Croatia, most notably at England’s expense in qualifying for Euro 2008, his one season at Lokomotiv Moscow ended in their worst league finish – ninth – since the Russian championship was formed in 1992. Besiktas, title winners in 2009, finished third in each campaign under the 46-year-old’s stewardship. “Some of the best days of my football life were during my one and a half seasons with West Ham,” added Bilic, who watched the tail end of the club’s Premier League season in anticipation of securing the position. “It is not only business: it is personal, it is emotional. They are a cult club.</p> \n<p>“It’s impossible to have a bigger bond with a club in such a small period of time. I clicked with the players, the fans, with everybody. So it is a privilege to be in charge of the team for its last season playing in a stadium they’ve played in for such a long time. It is a big responsibility to be manager and I hope I will prove [myself] to the board, players and fans. I will give my best and, together, we will achieve great things.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433882983943/Slaven-Bilic-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Slaven Bilic is hoping to deliver West Ham a Champions League place in the seasons ahead.

Since 2004 to 2014-15, Cech has had 10 years of success with the club, 10 years of unbelievable behaviour. I will have to accept any decision that the owner has. I’m different. I have the same respect for Petr that everybody at the club has, but my answer [to a proposed move to Arsenal] would be: ‘No way.’ If the answer is different I will accept that. But at every club that is interested in Petr I can find a player that I like in that team, too.”</p> \n<p>Mourinho added that he aims to recruit three players this summer to ensure his Premier League-winning team do not lose their appetite. He also expressed his satisfaction that none of his key men are likely to leave. “I think [the most important business] is done, which is to keep the players I want to keep. In other seasons I was very happy to sell a few players, even good players. This season I’m not happy to sell my best players so that is the real challenge to keep them.</p> \n<p>“If I keep Hazard and Matic and Ivanovic and Diego Costa, F&agrave;bregas; if I keep all of these important players for us that’s the first target. I think then we need three players. A striker, because we lost our legend [Didier Drogba], a defender and a midfield player. Give a little bit more competitiveness to the squad, bring some new blood in, put some players a little bit under pressure. They know they have someone waiting, I need that to support my way of working. Now they’re the champions I need that. But basically [Chelsea will have] the same squad, the same team, the same manager, stability in the club.”</p> \n<p>Mourinho, speaking at BT Sport studios at an event to announce that he will provide analysis for the channel as it begins exclusive live coverage of the Champions League and Europa League, also called for the introduction of a winter break to help English sides go farther in European competitions.</p> \n<p>The Chelsea manager believes they arrive at the knockout stages of tournaments more drained than their European counterparts and would like the Premier League to pause in January, allowing players to recharge without sacrificing traditional festive period fixtures.</p> \n<p>“I love our football in December,” said Mourinho. “But the reality is that when the other teams are coming into the second part of the Champions League they are very fresh after a good rest; after a second pre-season they are not tired. We are sometimes physically and mentally tired and it is more difficult for English clubs. English clubs did it in the past and will do in the future but it is more difficult for us. We could do something after the new year. We can still play five or six matches in two weeks – amazing Boxing Day matches and so on – but after that we should do something to give the players a little bit of a break.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433859495051/peter-cech-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chelsea's Petr Cech claims a cross against Arsenal in a league game at the Emirates Stadium.

The 25-year-old recognised an opportunity had presented itself at club level following the departures of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand last summer, and his form duly earned him the armband in the absence of Wayne Rooney and, in April, a new four-year contract.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/07/republic-of-ireland-england-five-talking-points\">Republic of Ireland v England: five talking points</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Louis van Gaal suggested the defender’s game had developed significantly over the course of the season, with Smalling confident he and his club-mate Phil Jones have made a positive impression. “I think it was make or break considering the outgoings at centre-back last summer,” said the former Fulham player.</p> \n<p>“It was a chance where players had to step in and, luckily, I’ve been one of those who has had a good run, especially in the second half of the season. Apart from the start of the season, when I had a few injuries, I’ve been able to have a good run and the manager has shown faith in me at United.</p> \n<p>“We take more risks at United than the majority of teams but the manager wants us to play. That is something we have fully taken on board, because that is his style, and I think that has helped me when playing in the games. On the back of that, it was nice to get another England game [in the Republic of Ireland] to carry on the season. Now it is all about building on that next season.”</p> \n<p>That appearance in Dublin was only Smalling’s fourth in England’s nine games since last summer’s World Cup finals and his second start in succession after the friendly draw in Italy during March. Although Hodgson has often turned back to his most experienced centre-half pairing of Cahill and Jagielka in more awkward contests, there is a recognition that younger combinations must be introduced. Smalling is effectively competing with Jones and the highly regarded John Stones, currently with the Under-21s for the summer’s European Championship, for a regular place.</p> \n<p>The game in Slovenia represents another timely opportunity for Smalling to stake a long-term claim for a centre-half position.</p> \n<p>Hodgson will seek a much-improved performance from his team against their nearest challengers in Group E after the anaemic offering in Dublin, but an 11th match without defeat – the run started with a 0-0 draw against Costa Rica at the World Cup – is their objective.</p> \n<p>“We’re unbeaten since Brazil and in that run we’ve had some very good performances, a lot of them better than in Dublin,” said Smalling. “The fact we’re still unbeaten has bred confidence. We could have done a lot better against the Republic of Ireland but we kept a clean sheet and we’ll try and take some positives from it. We probably needed that game given the time we’d all had off.</p> \n<p>“We have a job to do on Sunday. It is one of those where we know if we do the job it [qualification] is near enough there and we can go into the summer relieved and happy. Whereas if we don’t win this game it is a long break [with the job still to be finished] so I don’t think there will be any problems with people getting up for it.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/9/1433868474034/chris-smalling-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"England's Chris Smalling, right, was picked ahead of Phil Jagielka for Sunday's friendly against the Republic of Ireland in Dublin.

These days the Crystal Palace midfielder operates in a more defensive role, while Bale wreaks havoc further forward and off the field it is the Real Madrid player whose voice carries the greatest influence in the Wales dressing room.</p> \n<p>“I roomed with him once or twice, we had just come into the squad, he was quiet and used to just get on with it. Now things are changing,” said Ledley, who has gone on to win 56 caps for Wales. “You can see from Gareth that he plays for one of the best teams in the world and you can only just listen to a person like that and learn. [On the pitch] he used to be behind me a lot of the time and me in front. That has sort of changed now. That is Gareth. He loves getting on the pitch and proving everyone wrong.</p> \n<p>“You could always see he had something special, brilliant on the ball, fast and you could see his free-kicks as well – he has always had that. You never thought maybe Madrid but that is down to him. That is his dedication and the way that he has focused on the game. Credit to him, he deserves to be where he is. For me, he is one of the best players in the world.”</p> \n<p>Wales are unbeaten in qualifying, with three wins and two draws so far, and have realistic hopes of reaching next summer’s finals in France, yet there is an acknowledgment that Bale will need to be performing at the top of his game, as was the case in <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/28/israel-wales-euro-2016-qualifying-match-report\" title=\"\">the 3-0 win over Israel</a> at the end of March, if they are to upset Belgium and supplant them as Group B leaders.</p> \n<p>Bale’s difficult second season at Madrid has been well documented but the 25-year-old feels at home in every sense when he joins up with Wales.</p> \n<p>Osian Roberts, the Wales coach, talked about how Bale has produced some moments of jaw-dropping brilliance on the training ground in the past few days, while Ledley admitted that his team-mate always seems comfortable in the international set-up.</p> \n<p>“It is different. We don’t speak Spanish! We speak English and Welsh!” Ledley said, smiling. “Gareth comes in, he likes meeting up, looks relaxed and he is one of the lads. We treat him as one of the boys and don’t treat him any differently. Just like [Aaron] Ramsey also. That is what you need here. Credit to Gareth, he loves meeting up.
