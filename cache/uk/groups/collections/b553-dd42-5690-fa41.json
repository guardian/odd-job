The two clubs are currently negotiating a fee for the 31-year-old, who has agreed personal terms with the club and is ready to sign a four-year deal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/morgan-schneiderlin-manchester-united-southampton\">Manchester United to improve offer for Southampton’s Morgan Schneiderlin</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Holland international’s wife initially had reservations about a move to Turkey, but warmed to the idea after spending last week in Istanbul. The Guardian understands that the former Fenerbahce winger Dirk Kuyt has been key in convincing Van Persie to make the move. The former Liverpool player spent three seasons in Istanbul winning the Super Lig, the Turkish Cup and Turkish Super Cup during his time.</p> \n<p>Since being Louis van Gaal’s captain when the Dutchman coached Holland at last summer’s World Cup in Brazil, Van Persie’s stock has fallen dramatically at United. When Van Gaal took over the 20-times champions a few days after the tournament ended, Van Persie was considered the favourite to be named United’s new leader following Nemanja Vidic’s departure.</p> \n<p>However, Van Gaal chose Wayne Rooney to wear the armband instead with Darren Fletcher and Michael Carrick his vice-captains. This was an initial indication of how the manager viewed Van Persie and by the end of the season the striker had been dropped by Van Gaal.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/03/manchester-united-refuse-sell-david-de-gea-sergio-ramos\">Manchester United refuse to sell David de Gea unless they get Sergio Ramos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Even Radamel Falcao, who suffered a dismal campaign while on-loan at United, kept Van Persie out of the side. For the pivotal visit to Chelsea on 18 April Falcao started against Jos&eacute; Mourinho’s team and Van Persie was an unused substitute. What may be his final appearance for the club came as a 61st-minute substitute for Falcao in the 1-1 draw with Arsenal at Old Trafford on 17 May.</p> \n<p>For a player who fired United to their last championship, in the 2012-13 season, Sir Alex Ferguson’s final in charge, his exit, if confirmed, will prove muted. Since that season Van Persie has been injury plagued and his goal return has fallen away. Last season he managed only 10 in all competitions for United.</p> \n<p>Van Persie’s United team-mate Nani is also on his way to Fenerbahce and will have a medical with the club on Sunday.

Arsenal v Liverpool in Borehamwood and Chelsea v Bristol Academy in Staines will seem a long way from playing in front of 31,000 in Edmonton for a place in the World Cup final. But a swift return to action has its benefits – and one will be that the momentum gained by what happened in Canada can feed upon an energised domestic audience.</p> \n<p>This has the chance to be a turning point for women’s football and it is important that the increased interest and goodwill are not allowed to fade. The manner of England’s performances – the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\" title=\"\">agonising defeat against Japan</a> and the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report\" title=\"\">recovery to make history against Germany</a> – was heroic and will stick in the memory. The job now is to ensure that those hearts and minds are captured on a longer-lasting basis, and the hard work that has been going on for years needs to step up another level.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/05/england-mark-sampson-germany-womens-world-cup\">Mark Sampson hails ‘awesome’ England players after Germany play-off win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>When you hear that 2.4 million people stayed up to watch the semi-final – a greater number than watched some live Premier League games last season – it hits home that there is a genuine <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jul/02/women-footballers-olympics-england-world-cup-fa\" title=\"\">appetite to watch the women’s team in major tournaments</a>. If we can engage just 3% or 4% of that television audience to go out and support our domestic teams, then, with the league restarting next week and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/mar/09/wembley-host-womens-fa-cup-final-2015\" title=\"\">August’s FA Cup final being held at Wembley for the first time</a>, the increase in attendances would be huge.</p> \n<p>There is an opportunity to win thousands of new supporters and, crucially, there is also a chance for clubs to attract some serious sponsorship. That has to be the next step. Participation is always important and the FA has done superbly to create a situation where girls have more opportunities to play than ever before. That must continue but perhaps the biggest impact the World Cup could make is in potential sponsors realising that this is a sport they can work with.</p> \n<p>I know from experience the questions companies will ask: “What figures will we see? What audience are we going to get?” Hopefully this World Cup has shown that the interest is there but also that our players can be viably marketed to a new, family-based audience. These are wonderful role models: honest young women who would give anything to play for the Three Lionesses. Their motivation has been to push the game on and inspire youngsters who dream of playing for England. It would be a huge step if the ladies’ branches of clubs such as mine, Arsenal, can attract sponsorship in their own right and become more sustainable individually. The benefits for the league’s professionalism would be immeasurable.</p> \n<p>Improving the match-day experience must be a priority if we are to attract new fans and keep them – giving people that “wow” factor and getting them close to their heroes. Our average attendance at Arsenal is just over 800; that is 100 up on last year and we are aiming to exceed 1,000, the league’s average, this season. We have a great set-up at Borehamwood but it would push us on if we could play more games at the Emirates Stadium, where the feeling of occasion is something special. There is a general need to improve facilities and make it easier for people to attend games – not everyone is in the same position as Notts County, who share Meadow Lane with their men’s team and have won new supporters as a result.</p> \n<p>The media has a role to play, too. Coverage has improved hugely; a few slightly demeaning articles appeared early in this World Cup but overall it was a big step forward. Now it needs to continue – the men’s game restarts soon but consistent slots on the television, radio and in the newspapers would keep the narrative moving. People have learned a lot about the characters in the women’s team, so let’s develop them and keep telling the story.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report\">Germany 0-1 England (aet) | Women’s World Cup third-place play-off match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>We have to be realistic: it is easy for people to return to their routines after the initial euphoria of a tournament. That was perhaps what happened after <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2009/sep/10/england-germany-womens-euro-2009\" title=\"\">we reached the Euro 2009 final</a>, when our success did not make a huge difference in the long run.

She played the first game, against France, on the left of midfield but then captured her preferred position from Alex Scott. Not content with merely defending superbly, the 23-year-old who spent her early childhood living on Holy Island, or Lindisfarne, off the north Northumberland coast, also scored a spectactular <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/23/womens-world-cup-norway-england-match-report\">long-range winner against Norway </a>in the round of 16 and registered a vital <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/england-send-hosts-canada-packing-in-tense-quarter-final\">quarter-final header against Canada</a>. No wonder they are talking about the dawn of “The Bronze Age” in English women’s football. Mark Sampson, England’s coach says she is the best right-back in the world.</p> \n<h2>2 Aya Miyama – Japan </h2> \n<p>When Miyama plays well, so, invariably, do Japan. The 5ft 2in central midfielder tends to be at the hub of their best passing moves and also serves as the team’s set-piece specialist and penalty taker. This is the 30-year-old captain’s fourth World Cup, with the highlight of her career arriving when she lifted the trophy four years ago in Germany. A self-confessed coffee addict, Miyama now appears for the Okayama Yunogo Belle club but spent extensive parts of her career in the United States, playing in Los Angeles and Atlanta. A lovely midfielder to watch, she <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\">posed England plenty of problems in the semi-final</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/01/womens-world-cup-heartbreaking-own-goal-kills-englands-dreams\">Women's World Cup 2015: England dream dies with heartbreaking own goal</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<h2>3 Kadeisha Buchanan – Canada</h2> \n<p>At only 19 Buchanan is a dynamic, remarkably assured central defender known not only for rarely losing aerial battles but an ability to play the ball smoothly out from the back. She represents a big reason why John Herdman, Canada’s English coach, believes the future is bright for women’s football in the host country. The youngest of seven sisters brought up by a single mother, Buchanan combines life as a university student with playing for the Virginia Mountaineers in the United States. This will surely be the first of several World Cups for a young woman who makes a habit of exceeding expectations. “Kadeisha is the Christine Sinclair of my defence,” says Herdman. Praise indeed.</p> \n<h2>4 Carli Lloyd – USA</h2> \n<p>Pia Sundhage, the former USA coach, claimed Lloyd was difficult to work with because of a constant craving for praise, but there has been no sign of mental fragility from the attacking midfielder or second striker at Canada 2015. A big-occasion player, Lloyd – who has scored 66 goals in 201 international appearances – can look peripheral before suddenly scoring vital, wonderfully incisive goals. Her winner against China and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/womens-world-cup-usa-into-final-after-carli-lloyd-tames-germany\">penalty against Germany</a> are two big reasons why Jill Ellis’s side find themselves in the final. At 32 and now with Houston Dash, Lloyd appears in her prime. “She’s having the tournament of her life,” says her team-mate Abby Wambach.</p> \n<h2>5 Lady Andrade – Colombia</h2> \n<p>Even her team-mates say the brash 23-year-old star of Colombia’s World Cup could do with living up to the first part of her name a little more, but there is no doubt this improvisational creator lit up the tournament. Her adhesive control, breathtaking change of pace and vision enabled Lady Andrade to bewitch fans and bewilder opponents in equal measure as her side progressed from the group stage of a World Cup for the first time. Along the way the attacking midfielder or deep-lying forward scored in her country’s shock 2-0 group stage win over France and also contributed a <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/england-colombia-womens-world-cup-match-report\">consolation goal in the defeat against England</a>.

For Argentina the drought goes on: 22 years since their last trophy and an increasing sense that this gifted generation of players will remain unfulfilled.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/live/2015/jul/04/copa-america-2015-final-chile-argentina-live\">Chile win Copa Am&eacute;rica after beating Argentina on penalties – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Where better to achieve that first win than at home, asked Claudio Bravo on Friday; this wasn’t just about doing it in front of local fans. Few stadiums in the world have such symbolic value as Santiago’s Estadio Nacional in being representative of their nation. Behind the goal at one end a block is left perpetually empty, the benches still as they were in 1973 when the stadium was used as a prison camp after the coup through which Augusto Pinochet seized power. It was here that November that Chile kicked off against no opposition in a notorious World Cup qualifying play-off after the USSR refused to take to the field in a stadium in which leftists had been murdered a matter of weeks earlier. Above it is the legend <em>Un pueblo sin memoria es un pueblo sin futuro</em> – a people without a memory is a people without a future.</p> \n<p>The atmosphere before kick-off was extraordinary, small dashes of albiceleste breaking a great sweep of red, each of the home fans waving the national flags they’d been given as they came in. And beyond the stands, visible through the haze of dust and pollution for the first time in the tournament, loomed the rocky bulk of the Andes, an appropriately grand backdrop to the biggest game in Chile’s history.</p> \n<p>Some, it seems, got carried away in their nationalist fervour, with Lionel Messi’s family having to be moved into a television cabin at half-time after being abused and having objects thrown at them in the stands. There were further reports that his elder brother, Rodrigo, was punched.</p> \n<p>Chile had looked anxious in the semi-final against Peru, as though snatching at the prize as it came within touching distance, but here they started with a fury. Any thought that Jorge Sampaoli might compromise on his pressing principles and opt for something more conservative rapidly disappeared and for a time Argentina were unsettled. Had Arturo Vidal made better contact with a volley as S&aacute;nchez’s half-blocked cross dropped to him, the hosts might have had an early lead, but his mis-hit effort was scrambled away by the goalkeeper Romero.</p> \n<p>The one change Sampaoli did make was to push the midfielder Marcelo D&iacute;az extremely deep, almost as a third centre-back, which freed Gary Medel to leave the back-line and pursue Messi at times when he dropped deep. Predictably, he was booked before half-time, having caught Messi in the midriff with a swinging boot. The plan worked; this was a triumph for the coach, who was born just 35 miles from Messi’s home in Rosario. Messi had his quietest game of the tournament – his 63 touches in normal time were his fewest of this Copa Am&eacute;rica.</p> \n<p>One of the reasons Argentina were so cowed was due to Chile’s aggression, which clearly outraged their coaching staff. This tournament has seen Chile chart a course from romance via the decision not to suspend Vidal over <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/arturo-vidal-under-influence-alcohol-crashed-car-chile-copa-america\">his arrest on drink-driving charges</a> and Gonzalo Jara’s digital provocation of Edinson Cavani, to the pragmatic decision to try to kick Argentina off their stride. By half-time, all three central defenders had been booked and a game that had begun brightly had degenerated into something far scrappier.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jul/04/germany-england-womens-world-cup-third-place-match-report\">Germany 0-1 England (aet) | Women’s World Cup third-place play-off match report</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>By the second half, this felt far more like the Argentina of the World Cup than the side which had eviscerated Paraguay so thrillingly in the semi-final. They were defensively more secure than they had been, but lacked the fluidity and fluency of movement that characterised them even in the quarter-final against Colombia. Messi, in particular, was diminished, a frustrated and often isolated figure on the right, shirt untucked, shoulders slouched.</p> \n<p>As Argentina became increasingly frustrated, Chile had their chances – a Vidal effort that was charged down, a S&aacute;nchez volley that flashed across the face of goal – but the last clear opportunity of normal time fell to Argentina. Messi, at last finding space, broke and laid in Ezequiel Lavezzi, but his low cross was too far in front of the other substitute, Higua&iacute;n, who could only screw the ball into the side netting.</p> \n<p>Had he scored that chance, and had he scored the chance <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/jul/13/germany-argentina-world-cup-final-2014-match-report\">in the Maracana in the World Cup final last year</a>, this generation might be have gone down as one of the greatest.
