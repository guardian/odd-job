The total planned cost is now 631.5 billion roubles (&pound;7.4bn).</p> \n<p>“Of course it’s a question of optimising the preparations. We’re primarily taking out the excess hotels,” the sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, told the state news agency R-Sport on Monday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/20/putin-fifa-decision-to-grant-world-cup-2018-to-russia-should-not-be-questioned\">Putin says Fifa's granting of World Cup to Russia 'should not be questioned'</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Mutko said Russia was cutting “redundant” construction projects and had agreed with Fifa to reduce the number of hotels and other facilities planned for the World Cup. The number of training facilities at each stadium will now be three rather than four, he said.</p> \n<p>“This is a reflection of the difficult economic situation but it should not have a negative effect on the event itself,” Dmitry Yefimov, a Fifa representative in Russia, told R-Sport.</p> \n<p>Even before the reduction there were doubts that Russia could meet its World Cup budget, since the cost for the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics grew exponentially during construction, eventually reaching an estimated $50bn.</p> \n<p>The Russian government has implemented a 10% across-the-board budget cut this year amid reduced revenues from low oil prices. Despite suggestions Russia could be stripped of the World Cup if corruption is found during ongoing investigations, the president <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2015/jun/20/putin-fifa-decision-to-grant-world-cup-2018-to-russia-should-not-be-questioned\" title=\"\">Vladimir Putin this weekend reiterated his commitment to holding the event, noting that stadium construction had already started</a>. The Guardian reported this month that at least 40% of the World Cup construction programme was under way or has been completed.</p> \n<p>But in an investigation published on Sunday, the respected newspaper Vedomosti reported that <a href=\"http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2015/06/22/597304-kak-v-rossii-budut-ekonomit-na-chempionate-mira-po-futbolu\" title=\"\">at least half of Russia’s World Cup stadiums were behind schedule</a> and almost all were over budget this spring, quoting an unnamed stadium designer. In particular, the rouble crisis of last year, when the currency lost more than half its value against the dollar, caused prices for largely imported equipment to rocket. According to Mikhail Khryapov, director of Stroitransgaz, which is building the stadiums in Volgograd and Nizhny Novgorod, equipment prices rose by 50% and the overall cost of the project increased by 15%.</p> \n<p>In addition, World Cup construction has run into unforeseen costs and delays. For instance, builders in Russia’s Kaliningrad exclave had to spend 850 million roubles on sand to firm up the swampy ground where the World Cup stadium there is supposed to be constructed.</p> \n<p>As a result of delays and price overruns, the sports ministry allowed contractors and builders to simplify the designs, Vedomosti reported. A spokesperson for the first deputy prime minister, Igor Shuvalov, said stadium projects were cancelling extra features, using cheaper technologies, replacing imported products with local ones and re-examining contracts to try to cut out middlemen. At the same time all of Fifa’s quality and safety requirements would still be met, he said.</p> \n<p>Previously Fifa has allowed Russian organisers to reduce the planned capacity of World Cup stadium projects in Kaliningrad, Volgograd and Yekaterinburg to 35,000 rather than the standard 40,000.</p> \n<p>In a separate interview with the newspaper, Aras Agalarov, the president of Crocus Group, which is building the stadiums in Kaliningrad and Rostov-on-Don, said that after prices began to rise, <a href=\"http://www.vedomosti.ru/business/characters/2015/06/22/597305-pochemu-to-vse-zabili-chto-blatter-sdelal-dlya-mirovogo-futbola\" title=\"\">he received permission from the government to “optimise” these projects</a> to fit the previously planned budget. For instance, the number of elevators planned at the Rostov-on-Don stadium was reduced from 45 to 25, he said.</p> \n<p>According to the Vedomosti report, government agencies and building companies have claimed they were able to save significantly by replacing imports and making projects more efficient. Not all imports can be replaced, since some complicated electronics and other components are not made in Russia. But Chinese companies often produce copies of European components, and buying from them instead can reduce costs by 15% or more compared with European stadiums, according to Delovaya Rossiya, a civic organisation that promotes an open business climate.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1435013256143/Vitaly-Mutko-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The Russian sports minister, Vitaly Mutko, said costs for the 2018 World Cup will be reduced by. among other measures, dispensing with excess hotels and reducing the number of training facilities.

Such is the remarkable situation <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/west-ham-slaven-bilic-spending-spree\" title=\"\">Slaven Bilic</a> walks into, a summer like no other and the last season at Upton Park, where stability for at least another year is paramount.</p> \n<p>Bilic’s new job started in earnest on Monday when along with a significant proportion of the first-team squad he began preparations for the longest of campaigns. Most English clubs do not return for another couple of weeks but West Ham, because of Europa League commitments, have called players back early as they try to navigate what their co-chairman David Sullivan describes as a “nightmare” schedule.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/09/slaven-bilic-west-ham-rock-star-manager\">Slaven Bilic must show West Ham he is more than a rock star manager | Aleksandar Holiga</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>For Sullivan and co, however, it is a nightmare they are embracing, one which has provided a shot at European football and the opportunity for Bilic to begin with an immediate feelgood run. The consequences further down the line, though, are potentially treacherous.</p> \n<p>West Ham qualified for the 2015-16 Europa League <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/26/west-ham-europa-league-fair-play-place\" title=\"\">through Uefa’s fair play ranking</a>, ensuring a first European season for nine years despite finishing 12th in the Premier League. But to reach the group stage of the competition they will need to play eight matches, six before the start of the English domestic season and then a two-leg play-off.</p> \n<p>The first of Uefa’s three, two-leg qualifying rounds starts a week on Thursday and West Ham were on Monday drawn against <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/europa-league-draw-west-ham-fc-lusitans\" title=\"\">FC Lusitans of Andorra</a>. To say it has caused complications for the club is an understatement. West Ham have had to arrange a full pre-season programme alongside the European fixtures, in many ways a contingency plan should they depart the competition early while also providing extra fitness practice for those not ready for competitive action.</p> \n<p>Their pre-season fixtures begin against Peterborough on 11 July and include games against Southend, Colchester, Charlton, Norwich and possibly Werder Bremen, when youth players will get more of a run-out than normal. “The most difficult thing is the pre-season because you don’t know what round you are going to get knocked out in,” Sullivan said. “You have to have fixtures lined up in case you are knocked out. We’ve got a full pre-season of games and we have to juggle players between that with European competition.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/europa-league-draw-west-ham-fc-lusitans\">Europa League draw: West Ham to play FC Lusitans of Andorra</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“It’s a nightmare really but it’s fascinating and fun. It will be the most meaningful pre-season because instead of playing just friendlies where the results don’t matter, you’re playing games where the results do matter. It’s very exciting but quite arduous and quite complicated to work out a strategy. It’s a nightmare but what can you do?</p> \n<p>“It’s also a dream, another route to the Champions League. We’d be 1,000-1 to get that. Success is participation, giving fans a taste of Europe. We’ll be pricing the games to sell them out and anticipate very large gates from the early rounds on. Our supporters are very excited.”</p> \n<p>Given that West Ham finished the 2014-15 season only four weeks ago, it is quite a turnaround. If they advance to the third qualifying round of the Europa League, the second leg of which is scheduled for 6 August, their first Premier League game of the new season against Arsenal will have to be played on either the Sunday or Monday after the opening Saturday.</p> \n<p>Such is the need for players that Mauro Z&aacute;rate, who spent last season on loan at QPR, has been recalled. The Argentinian’s deal with QPR was due to run until 1 July but West Ham are in urgent need of numbers. Enner Valencia, meanwhile, has beenon international duty with Ecuador at the Copa Am&eacute;rica.</p> \n<p>Any new signings cannot be registered for the first round of Europa League qualifying, so West Ham are set to line up with a patchwork side until other players return. Those who featured heavily last season did not begin training on Monday and have been given extra time to rest. They will not attend a pre-season camp in Ireland that was arranged by Sam Allardyce, Bilic’s predecessor.</p> \n<p>This is a pivotal season for the club, one that will end with a move to the Olympic Stadium and which, for West Ham’s future health, must end with Premier League safety assured. Most other clubs do not start their preparations for a number of days, Tottenham’s players returning on 3 July, Manchester City’s on 7 July and Chelsea’s on 15 July.</p> \n<p>No team have won the Europa League from the first qualifying round since the rebranding of the tournament in 2009, a feat that would require participation in 23 matches. When Fulham reached the 2010 final they played 18 matches, having begun at the third qualifying stage.</p> \n<p>Indeed, the knock-on effect for English teams is usually negative on the domestic front, with many struggling to adapt to the Thursday-Sunday sequence of fixtures. Dr Andrew Hill, a leading academic expert in burnout, described the potential psychological impact that an extended season could have.</p> \n<p>“You could argue that starting earlier and playing more fixtures is associated with greater psychological stress,” said Hill. “You have to prepare for more games, deal with the successes and failures associated with those games. Potentially, the more fixtures you play and the more congested it becomes, you’re experiencing higher levels of stress and have less time to recover.”</p> \n<p>Sullivan said: “There is an element of risk. Traditionally English teams who play in this competition don’t do that well. It seems to be an English disease that we can’t play on the Thursday and the Sunday.”</p> \n<p>Financially, the Europa League is far less rewarding than the Champions League. West Ham will receive &pound;1.7m (€2.4m) if they reach the group stage, where they receive €360,000 for a win and €120,000 for a draw. The teams competing in the group stage of the Champions League receive €12m.</p> \n<p>The opportunity for supporters to travel across Europe is one many are relishing, even if the financial rewards for the club are relatively insignificant. According to Alison Worth, formerly of the West Ham Supporter Advisory Board and in the process of creating an independent supporters’ association, the excitement is mixed with an air of trepidation.</p> \n<p>“I’m old enough to remember the old European excitement and I think it’s wonderful for the fans and a great experience,” she said. “But we don’t have a full squad at the moment, we are quite short in key areas. It could go dramatically wrong, that is my concern. There is a real split between fans over 40 and those younger ones. As much as the older supporters are loving being in Europe, we know we can’t afford to let our Premier League status be questioned in any way. It’s a double-edged sword, because I haven’t been this excited for a number of years.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434972523728/2f1a193a-01ec-4e8a-ab21-9fbe659c3f37-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Arfa Griffiths/West Ham United via Getty Images","altText":"New West Ham manager Slaven Bilic.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Arfa Griffiths/West Ham United via Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-22T11:38:30Z","lastModified":"2015-06-22T23:01:21Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":221,"contributors":[{"name":"James Riach","image":{"urlTemplate":"http://png-resizer.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/contributor/2014/8/20/1408555677652/James-Riach-L.png?width=#{width}"},"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/james-riach"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["West Ham United","Europa League","David Sullivan","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/westhamunited","webTitle":"West Ham United"},{"id":"football/uefa-europa-league","webTitle":"Europa League"},{"id":"football/david-sullivan","webTitle":"David Sullivan"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"James Riach","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/james-riach"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/22/west-ham-europa-league-slaven-bilic","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ax4c","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/22/west-ham-europa-league-slaven-bilic","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/22/west-ham-europa-league-slaven-bilic"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/22/1434972523728/2f1a193a-01ec-4e8a-ab21-9fbe659c3f37-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"West Ham’s new manager Slaven Bilic will be taking his squad to Ireland for a pre-season training camp.
