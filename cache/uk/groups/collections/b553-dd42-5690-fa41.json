After spending five weeks with the side in Canada she acknowledges a certain conflict of loyalties as preparations for Sunday’s quarter-final against the host nation in Vancouver intensify.</p> \n<p>It helps that her husband Mark, an electrician, surprised Chapman by flying out to Moncton – England’s base for their first two group games – with their three sons, 12-year-old Harvey, six-year-old Riley and two-year-old Zachary.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/25/womens-world-cup-power-rankings-germany\">Women's World Cup power rankings: Germany lead the way from Matildas</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The brief visit was designed to celebrate Chapman’s 33rd birthday and Zachary’s second. “I had no clue whatsoever they were coming. When they turned up it was a massive surprise I just stood there and cried,” says the Chelsea midfielder. “Before the tournament we’d decided we couldn’t do it money wise. But Mark then decided we could! For me to come down and see them standing there was overwhelming. Mark sorted the finances and the flights off his own bat. It was so lovely to see my family.”</p> \n<p>An indirect long-haul flight from London to Moncton with three children in economy cannot have been easy but her husband was determined to stage a double birthday reunion. “It was a massive task for him,” says Chapman. “I’m really proud of him but he’s a really hands-on Dad. He felt that strongly about wanting to bring them over to see me. I didn’t want to miss Zachary’s second birthday [<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/england-mexico-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">on the day of the Mexico game</a>] so that was a real bonus for me.</p> \n<p>“I was able to see them that evening after beating Mexico and sing happy birthday to him. That was really lovely. If I’m away from the children for any length of time I miss them. I needed that. It was great to have that family time but then it was back to having a real focus on the tournament and getting on with the job.”</p> \n<p>Not that a woman who was dropped from the squad by Hope Powell, Sampson’s predecessor, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2013/aug/22/hope-powell-england-players\" title=\"\">due to her family commitments</a>, and temporarily lost her central contract with England, is entirely out of touch with events back home.</p> \n<p>“FaceTime is a life saver,” she says. “I’ve been speaking to them quite a lot on the computer. But I’m finding being in Vancouver with the eight-hour time difference a bit tough. It’s quite weird. We got here on Tuesday night and then I had to try and catch them before they went to school . As they are getting up I’m going to bed.”</p> \n<p>Chapman needs her sleep ahead of an occasion she hopes will make all her sacrifices worthwhile. “It’s going to be an absolutely massive game, maybe the biggest of my career,” she says. “Playing the home nation in front of a 50,000-plus crowd is going to create a very hostile atmosphere. We’re going to have to manage that.</p> \n<p>“But there’s a lot of excitement around the camp. We’ve got great quality within this squad of 23 players. We’ve been building momentum and I think we’ve got better with each game. I’m hoping to take that momentum into the Canada game. I quite like having the feeling of having the crowd against us.</p> \n<p>“It might give me a lift. It’s going to be a tough game but there’s a lot of pressure on Canada. They’ve been struggling to score goals so I think we can take advantage of that. We’ll have a gameplan to exploit it. We’re in the quarters now and we believe we can keep progressing.”</p> \n<p>After giving birth to their twins only last autumn, Casey Stoney’s partner Megan Harris seems highly unlikely to make the long trek to Canada’s west coast – “we’ve decided to all go away and have a good holiday later this year,” says the England defender – but, like Chapman, Stoney has become a FaceTime regular.</p> \n<p>Both women are looking forward to returning home – although not until after the denouement a week on Sunday. “If we could get to the final it would be unbelievable,” says Chapman. “It would be ‘oh my God’.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/25/1435254264932/Katie-Chapman-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Katie Chapman, left, challenges Norway’s Solveig Gulbrandsen during England’s 2-1 World Cup last-16 win in Ottawa.

While there has been no shortage of interest in Mings, who cost Ipswich only &pound;10,000 when they signed him from non-league Chippenham Town in December 2012, Bournemouth’s willingness to meet the Championship club’s valuation of the player propelled them to the front of queue.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/dec/18/tyrone-mings-ipswich\">Tyrone Mings makes his mark at Ipswich on and off the pitch | Stuart James</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Mings was given permission to talk to Bournemouth and travelled to the south coast on Wednesday night to hold talks with Eddie Howe on Thursday morning. He was hugely impressed with Howe and believes that the Bournemouth manager will help to develop his talent as part of the next step in a career that has gone from strength to strength ever since he gave up work as a mortgage adviser two and a half years ago.</p> \n<p>Rejected by Southampton at the age of 16, Mings was turning out for Chippenham Town and driving a Citro&euml;n Saxo that cost him &pound;100 when Ipswich offered him a trial in December 2012. Mick McCarthy, the Ipswich manager, liked what he saw and the five-figure sum the Championship club paid Chippenham for Mings must rank as one of their best investments.</p> \n<p>Mings, who is 6ft 5in, blessed with a good left foot and is a fine athlete, blossomed under McCarthy’s watch and attracted attention from leading Premier League clubs, including Arsenal and Chelsea, where his father, Adie, works as a scout. Crystal Palace had a &pound;3m bid for Mings rejected last September and the player’s value continued to climb during a season in which Ipswich reached the play-off semi-finals before losing to Norwich.</p> \n<p>Howe has watched Mings’s progress closely and the Bournemouth board backed his judgment to make a move for a player who was coveted by a number of their top-flight rivals only for them to be discouraged by the price put on his head.</p> \n<p>As well as catching the eye with his performances on the pitch at Portman Road, Mings has picked up a reputation for being something of a good Samaritan in the world of football, with various gestures of goodwill, including one act of kindness that made him national news before he had made his debut for Ipswich.</p> \n<p>In March 2013 Mings exchanged tweets with an Ipswich supporter who could not afford to go their home match against Bolton because he was “skint”. Mings replied on Twitter and said that he would leave his complimentary tickets at Portman Road for the fan to collect. The exchange between the two went viral.</p> \n<p>In an interview with the Guardian in December, Mings talked about how much enjoyment he got from <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/dec/18/tyrone-mings-ipswich\" title=\"\">spending Christmas Day in 2013 feeding the homeless in Ipswich</a>.
