Equally enormous is the public interest in an independent criminal procedure,” Lauber said. “Our investigation is of great complexity and quite substantial. To give you an example: The SAG [Swiss attorney general’s office] has seized around nine terabytes of data. So far, our investigative team has obtained evidence concerning 104 banking relations; be aware that every banking relation represents several bank accounts.”</p> \n<p>He warned there would be interviews of “all relevant people” and specifically did not rule out interviewing the Fifa president Sepp Blatter, who promised to step down in the wake of the US indictment, and the general secretary, J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Valcke, who is under pressure over what he knew about a $10m payment from South Africa to the Caribbean that US prosecutors claimed was a bribe.</p> \n<p>At a press conference in Bern, Lauber said that Swiss banks had fulfilled their obligations to report suspicious banking activity and that the Swiss investigation had not been instigated as a result of the FBI investigation.</p> \n<p>The Swiss investigation into the controversial and chaotic World Cup bidding process – in which England lost out for the 2018 tournament and the US among the bidders for 2022 – was made public on the same day that US prosecutors alleged a “World Cup of fraud” stretching back two generations and dramatically arrested seven executives in Zurich.</p> \n<p>It has seized data and documents during two visits to Fifa’s headquarters and collected documents from Swiss marketing agency Kentaro relating to a friendly between Brazil and Argentina in Doha in 2010.</p> \n<p>Fifa argued that the Swiss investigation was as a result of it handing over documents relating to an investigation by its ethics committee chief, Michael Garcia, and that as such it was in fact the “injured party”.</p> \n<p>“For the time being Fifa is the injured party, that is true. They filed the report and this is the actual status as we conduct investigations against unknown persons,” said Lauber, but he warned that could change.</p> \n<p>“We didn’t start the investigation against Fifa. We started the investigations based on that [report] and based on a mutual legal assistance request from the US.”</p> \n<p>Asked whether the Swiss investigation, which is clearly already broader in scope than Garcia’s given the Swiss prosecutors’ ability to examine bank accounts, would tally with Fifa’s release of the full Garcia report Lauber said he was working to his own timetable and was not concerned about “collateral damage” elsewhere.</p> \n<p>“We are faced with a complex investigation with many international implications. The prosecution is ongoing and will take time,” he said. “It would not be professional to communicate at this moment a detailed timetable. The world of football needs to be patient. By its nature, this investigation will take more than the legendary 90 minutes.”</p> \n<p>Lauber, who said the “huge and complex” investigation could take months if not years in places, also emphasised that the Swiss process was independent from the US procedure and that they would not automatically share documents and information.</p> \n<p>A disputed summary version of Garcia’s investigation, which caused the US attorney to quit his post in frustration, raised question marks over Qatar’s bid but said that there was not sufficient evidence to strip it of the tournament.</p> \n<p>The summary, written by the German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert, said that the Russian bid was unable to cooperate because it had returned its rented computers and lost all its emails.</p> \n<p>Under intense pressure, Fifa agreed to publish the Garcia report in full with redactions but has yet to do so while ethics cases against individuals are ongoing.</p> \n<p>Scala said last week in the wake of B<a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/15/sepp-blatter-stands-by-promise-resign-fifa-president\" title=\"\">latter’s promise to step down</a> as Fifa president that a revote on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments remained a possibility.</p> \n<p>“If evidence should emerge that the awards to Qatar and Russia only came about thanks to bought votes then the awards could be invalidated,” said Scala, the independent chairman of Fifa’s audit and compliance committee, in an interview with the Swiss newspaper SonntagsZeitung. “This evidence has not yet been brought forth.”</p> \n<p>Fifa’s chief ethics investigator Cornel Borbely, who took over after Garcia resigned in December, said he was prepared to widen the net if new evidence came to light.</p> \n<p>He said in a statement: “The independent investigatory chamber of the Fifa Ethics Committee is carrying out several proceedings into football officials on suspicion of breach of the Fifa code of ethics based on the findings of the investigation into the decision for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.</p> \n<p>“Should new evidence come to light, the investigatory chamber will widen the group of suspects. The Investigatory Chamber has taken the necessary preparatory measures for this and is prepared to increase its staff numbers at any time if needed.”</p> \n<p>Elsewhere, the Asian Football Confederation’s general secretary, Alex Soosay, has tendered his resignation with immediate effect. Soosay was suspended last month amid allegations that he ordered a cover-up during an investigation into the organization in 2012.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434533486660/Swiss-Attorney-General-La-005.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":276,"width":460,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber is surrounded by reporters in Bern after revealing his office is looking into a vast data haul from Fifa HQ.

The club have made a &pound;5m offer for the 18-year-old but Fulham want considerably more and City will have to go back with a higher offer to make the deal happen.</p> \n<p>A compromise is likely to be reached in both cases but City’s information from Liverpool is that the asking price is around the &pound;50m mark and that would mean making Sterling their most expensive acquisition since Sheikh Mansour bought the club in 2008. The previous high was set in 2009 when Carlos Tevez joined in a deal that was initially described as being worth &pound;25.5m, only for it to emerge it had actually cost the club about &pound;47m.</p> \n<p>That was in an era when City largely went by a money-no-object rule but they have modified their approach over recent seasons and made it clear on several occasions that they will not pay what they consider to be vastly inflated prices just because selling clubs know of the wealth that exists among the sheikh and his colleagues at the Abu Dhabi United Group. That stance is now being severely tested.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s public position is that they do not want to sell Sterling, who has two years remaining on his contract, but the situation has deteriorated since he turned down a new &pound;100,000-a-week deal in January and diplomatic relations were called off with his agent, Aidy Ward, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/may/21/raheem-sterling-liverpool-agent-contract-900000\" title=\"\">after an outspoken attack on the club</a> when he said his client would not even sign for “&pound;900,000 a week”.</p> \n<p>Ward has made it clear he will lead an aggressive attempt to force a transfer and Liverpool have been so dismayed by his approach that they cancelled a meeting that had been arranged in May with the idea of reopening contract talks.</p> \n<p>Liverpool’s sixth-placed finish last season means they cannot offer their player Champions League football next season, whereas City can provide a place in Europe’s leading club competition, an improved chance of silverware and also a considerably higher salary. There is no doubt Sterling would like the move to go ahead and, in City’s favour, they are aware that Liverpool are trying to raise money for their own transfer targets. Christian Benteke is at the top of the list, with a buyout clause in his contract at Aston Villa set at &pound;32.5m. Liverpool have also made an unsuccessful opening bid of &pound;10m for Southampton’s Nathaniel Clyne.</p> \n<p>City are deliberately targeting English players to help them comply with the homegrown rules. Sterling is regarded as a better option than Samir Nasri while Roberts has been identified as a potential star of the future. The teenager has turned down a new contract at Craven Cottage and if a deal can be arranged it is likely he will be loaned out next season. Fabian Delph of Aston Villa is another possible target, although not a priority.</p> \n<p>As it stands, there are only three players in City’s senior squad who qualify as homegrown – Joe Hart, Ga&euml;l Clichy and Richard Wright, who has not played a first-team game since he was with Ipswich in 2011. James Milner has signed for Liverpool while Frank Lampard, Scott Sinclair and Dedryck Boyata have all been released or sold and Micah Richards has just agreed a four-year deal with Villa on a free transfer now his contract at City has expired.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434555284544/Raheem-Sterling-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Manchester City have seen another offer for the Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling rejected.

A talent to revive.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2014/sep/22/-sp-jorge-mendes-agent-third-party-ownership-players\">Jorge Mendes: the most powerful man in football?</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The loan move for Falcao, which should be confirmed after a medical once his national team’s involvement in the Copa Am&eacute;rica concludes, can be considered only in the context of his toils last term at Manchester United. The striker’s arrival at Old Trafford had been hailed a coup. Sure, he had sustained that tear to the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee in a French Cup tie against Monts d’or Azergues the previous January, cutting short his first campaign at Monaco after nine goals in 17 appearances, but his recovery had apparently been rapid. His surgeon, Jos&eacute; Carlos Noronha, had publicly suggested Falcao might be fit to feature in the summer’s World Cup in Brazil, and Jos&eacute; Pekerman had even included him in his provisional 30-man squad for the tournament.</p> \n<p>That proved to be wishful thinking but he scored twice in three Ligue 1 games at the start of last term before United took on his &pound;265,000-a-week salary, paid a &pound;6m loan fee and were promised the option to make the deal permanent for &pound;43.2m a year on. Those figures would not have felt that outlandish for a striker who had rampaged across Europe with Porto and Atl&eacute;tico Madrid – Chelsea still recall with a shudder his hat-trick <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2012/aug/31/chelsea-atletico-madrid-super-cup\">in the Uefa Super Cup in 2012</a>, and Mourinho his impact <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2013/may/17/copa-del-rey-atletico-real-madrid\">in the Copa del Rey final a year later</a> at Real Madrid’s expense – and making him the most sought-after forward in the world. The romantic notion was that he would rediscover his zest and run riot in a United shirt.</p> \n<p>Four goals in 29 games, a solitary shot on target in his last 12 Premier League appearances, and 71 minutes struggling to make any impact whatsoever with the club’s under-21s development side against Tottenham Hotspur in March tell their own story. His main contribution in the second string that night was to block two goal-bound shots. His attacking instincts in the six-yard box had been blunted.</p> \n<p>The industry and clever movement may have remained, the mind was apparently willing – as was proved with that slick turn to win <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/feb/28/manchester-united-sunderland-premier-league-match-report\">a penalty against Sunderland</a> in February – but he was devoid of a burst of pace to liberate him properly in front of goal. Watching him struggle so pitifully to influence games was depressing, given the force of nature he had been previously. The star who had envisaged becoming a legend at United ended up diminished.</p> \n<p>Yet this is the 29-year-old whom Chelsea, possibly after a fair deal of persuasion from the manager given the board is more comfortable these days purchasing younger potential, consider a risk worth taking. At this point the influence of Jorge Mendes, who represents both Falcao and Mourinho, should probably be acknowledged. There is a perception among other agents that Mendes alone could have smoothed this deal, which could be considered grudging recognition of the power he wields within the game, or frustration that the champions are taking on Falcao rather than one of the alternatives they are promoting. Chelsea, like United, Monaco and Atl&eacute;tico, deal with the Portuguese on a regular basis.</p> \n<p>Yet Mourinho will not want to lose face on this deal. He will want his judgment to be proved correct. Most managers would probably back themselves to reinvigorate a player who had once been considered the most ferocious forward of his generation. The manager who claimed the Premier League for Chelsea last term will see a player still capable of covering huge distances over 90 minutes even last season, a striker whose quickest darts were more rapid than those of Robin van Persie, and whose eagerness to work in all areas of the pitch would fit into the more selfless demands of Chelsea’s approach.</p> \n<p>The medical will confirm whether there are underlying physical issues with which the player is having to deal. The key to restoring Falcao will be Mourinho’s ability to heal the psychological wounds caused by the injury, the absence from the World Cup and his failure to thrive with United.</p> \n<p>It is that anxiety that flares these days in the six-yard box. He had opportunities last season – more regular chances than Lo&iuml;c R&eacute;my or Didier Drogba did at Chelsea – but, more often than not, he snatched at them. There was confusion etched across his face in the aftermath, that of a player perplexed at how what used to come so naturally now felt so alien.</p> \n<p>Maybe he lacked rhythm at Old Trafford in a team in transition. At Chelsea, a side whose evolution is more advanced and who better resemble the Atl&eacute;tico setup in which he had previously shone, he may be able to ease himself back in more gradually with Diego Costa still the attacking focal point of the side. The Colombian will play. Drogba, even in the twilight of his glittering career, featured 40 times last season and the calendar will be as crammed as ever in 2015-16. But joining the fray once Costa has left opposing centre-halves battered and bruised could also suit Falcao, offering opportunities against tiring defenders and teams who will frequently be playing catch-up.</p> \n<p>The loanee will not assume he is an automatic selection on the basis of everything that happened at Old Trafford. But Mourinho likes his fringe players to be hungry; personnel with plenty to prove. To that end, the manager flung down a challenge with that interview last week on the Latin American station DirecTV Sports. “For a player of his level and quality, it’s a real shame people in England think Falcao is the player who was at Manchester United,” he said. The message was clear: go and prove you can still do it. It was arguably the same among the strikers he has worked with at Chelsea with Hern&aacute;n Crespo and even Samuel Eto’o, players who wanted to justify their reputations and duly made an impact under his stewardship when others – Drogba and Torres respectively – had been considered first choice. Admittedly, it did not work with Shevchenko, though he was a player rather foisted on the management.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/chelsea-agree-radamel-falcao-loan-deal-monaco\">Chelsea agree terms with Monaco for season-long Radamel Falcao loan</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Costa’s presence – Thibaut Courtois is <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/thibaut-courtois-chelsea-monaco-radamel-falcao\">another ally from the Vicente Calder&oacute;n</a> – may be beneficial. The pair worked together at Atl&eacute;tico and, although their roles have now been reversed, they know each other’s games. If the Drogba and Costa partnership rarely felt comfortable, even if it was seldom required, Costa and Falcao may be a more natural combination: they scored 31 goals in tandem in Spain.</p> \n<p>Chelsea may also hope that Falcao’s arrival will help Costa’s assimilation, the Spain international having conceded there have been issues over adjustment to life in England. His will be another welcome familiar face, particularly if Filipe Lu&iacute;s returns to the Spanish capital.</p> \n<p>He would be an expensive foil, even at a revised wage package nearer &pound;170,000 a week and a &pound;4m loan fee, but Chelsea can afford it. There is an option but no obligation to make the move permanent for &pound;35m next summer, and they can incorporate his arrival in their budgets to comply with financial fair play and still pursue up to three more senior signings this summer.</p> \n<p>They are not bringing in a disruptive influence. Indeed, his United team-mates were surprised at how humble and amenable Falcao had been at Old Trafford, and he will fit in at Cobham. Coaxing him back to his best is a considerable undertaking, one Louis van Gaal could not pull off at United. But it is a challenge Mourinho will relish.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434552709151/Radamel-Falcao--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Radamel Falcao endured a lot of frustration at Manchester United.

their football clubs using powers traditionally given to crofters and island communities to mount buyouts of Highland estates.</p> \n<p>The powers would give supporters’ groups the right to become the first and preferred bidders if the owner of their club decides to sell or the club is facing closure after a financial collapse.</p> \n<p>MSPs at Holyrood supported amendments by the Scottish Green party to a <a href=\"http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/parliamentarybusiness/Bills/77926.aspx\">new community empowerment bill</a> after fans found themselves forced to mount last ditch rescue bids to save an increasing number of ailing Scottish clubs – including Stirling Albion, Dunfermline and Hearts of Midlothian – from closure.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>Never again would fans be left watching on the touchline as their club goes bust</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Alison Johnstone</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>Alison Johnstone, the Scottish Green MSP who championed the new provisions to a bill designed to offer residents the right to buy neglected or community assets, said it was a landmark decision. The amendment will require Scottish ministers to consult on the shape of the new powers over the summer.</p> \n<p>One possible, far-reaching option ministers could consider would be to give fans groups the legal right to put in a bid even if the club is not up for sale – a power already in force in Scotland for tenants of rural estates. </p> \n<p>“The principle of a fans’ right to buy is overwhelmingly popular and parliament is doing the right thing by backing it,” Johnstone said.</p> \n<p>“Many Scottish clubs are well-run, but everyone can name others which have been forced into administration, or worse. With this right, never again would fans be left watching on the touchline as their club goes bust. </p> \n<p>“This is a system that works well elsewhere, in places like Germany, Spain and Argentina, all countries which do rather better than Scotland at both a club and national level.”</p> \n<p>Paul Goodwin, one of the most influential figures in the fans buy-out campaign, said the new measures would make a significant difference in the Scottish game. Many clubs were now financially very vulnerable but could suddenly change hands without notice, or find themselves unable to find new owners.</p> \n<p>Goodwin, a marketing expert helped the Nationwide Building Society run its sponsorship of England’s football leagues for ten years, said at present fans were only allowed to make offers at the last moment after conventional options to sell a club had been exhausted. </p> \n<p>A new <a href=\"http://scottishfsa.org/\">Scottish Football Supporters Association</a> had recently been set up, chaired by former Labour first minister Henry McLeish, to help fans’ groups form registered and properly constituted “community interest companies” which would be able to make formal bids.</p> \n<p>He helped fans buy Stirling Albion, one of six Scottish clubs now wholly owned by their fans or being slowly bought by fans trusts, from its 83-year-old owner, in 2011. “It was literally a day before the club was going to go under because it had no assets,” he said. </p> \n<p>Fans at Heart of Midlothian in Edinburgh, the largest Scottish club to be saved by its supporters, are now slowly paying off a &pound;2.5m loan from businesswoman Ann Budge, who put in her own money to save it from closure. About 8,500 supporters are contributing &pound;15.50 a month each to pay her loan off over three years, to eventually give Foundation of Hearts sole ownership.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434568747806/97c3585e-b68d-422d-9f4c-82208e4c79a9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Graham Stuart/PA Archive/Press Association Ima","altText":"General view of Forthbank stadium, home of Stirling Albion","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Graham Stuart/PA Archive/Press Association Ima"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-17T19:23:37Z","lastModified":"2015-06-17T23:50:11Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":52,"contributors":[{"name":"Severin Carrell","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/severincarrell"}],"feature":false,"keywords":["Football","Scotland","Scottish politics","UK news","Politics","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"uk/scotland","webTitle":"Scotland"},{"id":"politics/scotland","webTitle":"Scottish politics"},{"id":"uk/uk","webTitle":"UK news"},{"id":"politics/politics","webTitle":"Politics"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Severin Carrell","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/severincarrell"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/scottish-football-fans-given-legal-right-to-buy-their-clubs","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/49qfh","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/17/scottish-football-fans-given-legal-right-to-buy-their-clubs","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/17/scottish-football-fans-given-legal-right-to-buy-their-clubs"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/17/1434568747806/97c3585e-b68d-422d-9f4c-82208e4c79a9-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"General view of Forthbank stadium, home of Stirling Albion, which was saved from closure by fans.
