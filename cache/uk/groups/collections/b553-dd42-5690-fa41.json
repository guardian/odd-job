The Premier League club have agreed a fee with Inter but harbour doubts that the 23-year-old Swiss international can be persuaded to swap San Siro for the Britannia Stadium.</p> \n<p>Stoke wanted to establish first of all whether they were in a position to be able to afford Shaqiri, who only joined the Serie A club from Bayern Munich in January. Yet nailing down that part of the deal appears to be the easy bit. Stoke realise that trying to convince Shaqiri to leave behind one of the most distinguished clubs in the world may prove challenging.</p> \n<p>The deal is not dead and it is worth remembering that Stoke signed Bojan from Barcelona last summer. Yet acquiring Shaqiri, who played 15 league games for Inter in the second half of last season, to follow in the Spaniard’s footsteps will be easier said than done.</p> \n<p><strong> </strong>One player certain to leave Stoke this summer is Asmir Begovic, with Chelsea expected to return with an improved &pound;8m bid for the 28-year-old goalkeeper, who is seen as a replacement for Petr Cech. Stoke rejected a &pound;6m offer for Begovic but are resigned to the fact that the Bosnian will leave and are keen to try to take a Chelsea player on loan as part of the transfer.</p> \n<p>Victor Moses spent last season on loan at Stoke but the indications are that he wants to keep his options open this term. Ruben Loftus-Cheek is another possibility but the word at Chelsea is that Mourinho will not consider allowing the 19-year-old midfielder to go out on loan. Patrick Bamford, prolific in the Championship with Middlesbrough last season, could also come into the equation.</p> \n<p>Jonathan Walters, the Republic of Ireland international, is another Stoke player whose future is in doubt. Walter has 12 months remaining on his deal and there has been no progress in relation to the talks over a new contract, raising the possibility of the 31-year-old leaving this summer.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/30/transfer-window-12-best-deals-summer\">Transfer window bargains: 12 of the best deals available this summer | Alan Smith</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435756404783/Inter-Milan-v-Fiorentina--009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Xherdan Shaqiri played 15 league games and scored once for Inter after joining from Bayern Munich in January.

The 44-year-old is regarded highly by Leicester fans and is likely to have support among key personnel within the club.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/30/nigel-pearson-leicester-sacked\">Leicester City sack Nigel Pearson due to ‘differences in perspective’</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Jon Rudkin, who was appointed director of football in February, and Andrew Neville, the club’s director of football operations, know Lennon well – as well as Martin O’Neill, another name in the frame – and both men will be involved in the process of liaising with Leicester’s board and Thai owners about Pearson’s successor.</p> \n<p>A move for Lennon would not be straightforward because he is in work and the same is true of Sean Dyche, who will be managing alongside the Northern Irishman in the Championship next season. Dyche, the Burnley manager, is also likely to be receptive to an offer to return to the Premier League.</p> \n<p>Steve Cotterill is another Championship manager on Leicester’s radar. Cotterill led Bristol City to the League One title in style last season, having previously made a favourable impression with Leicester when he coached at the club towards the end of the 2003-04 season under Micky Adams. Rudkin was working for Leicester at that point.</p> \n<p>Other possible targets include Esteban Cambiasso, who has yet to decide whether to take up the offer of another playing contract at the club, Roberto Di Matteo and O’Neill, the Republic of Ireland manager who was such a success during his time in charge of Leicester between 1995-2000. The final say will rest with Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, the club’s billionaire Thai owner, and Aiyawatt, his son, and it remains to be seen whether a high-profile name is important to them.</p> \n<p>Although Leicester will not be rushed into making an appointment, the new Premier League campaign gets underway five weeks on Saturday and pre-season training has already started for a few of their players. The majority of the Leicester squad will return on Monday, with those involved in international fixtures after the end of the season given a slightly longer break. Pearson, meanwhile, is still to agree compensation with Leicester after being relieved of his duties only 12 months into a three-year contract.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435780402252/Neil-Lennon-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Neil Lennon, who enjoyed a distinguished playing career at Leicester City between 1996-2000, would find it hard to turn down any approach.

has become Liverpool’s sixth signing of a hectic summer after completing a &pound;12.5m move from Southampton.</p> \n<p>The England international signed a long-term contract at Anfield on Wednesday after a concerted effort by Liverpool to land Brendan Rodgers’ first choice for their problematic right-back position. Clyne, who started his career at Crystal Palace before going on to make 94 appearances for Southampton, passed a medical on Monday and becomes the fourth player to move from St Mary’s Stadium to Anfield in the past year.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/24/roberto-firmino-liverpool-thiever-of-balls\">Liverpool’s Roberto Firmino: a thiever of balls who never stops running | Marcus Christenson</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“I’m delighted and it’s a dream move for me to come here and play for such a big club with all of its history. I can’t wait to get started,” <a href=\"http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/187852-liverpool-sign-nathaniel-clyne\" title=\"\">Clyne told Liverpool’s website</a>.</p> \n<p>“As soon as Liverpool showed their interest in me, I was happy and just wanted the deal to go through.</p> \n<p>“The gaffer has shown a lot of interest in me and this is a place where I can improve as a player, I think. It’s definitely a good opportunity to come here and try to fulfil my potential.</p> \n<p>“I’ve played at Anfield before and know what the atmosphere is all about. It’s a great atmosphere and will make me rise to the challenge. I’m really looking forward to it and hopefully it can push me on to putting on good performances.”</p> \n<p>Clyne had only 12 months remaining on his Southampton contract but the south coast club rejected Liverpool’s opening offer of &pound;10m, insisting on &pound;15m, before a compromise fee was agreed.</p> \n<p>The 24-year-old follows <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/08/danny-ings-james-milner-liverpool-brendan-rodgers\" title=\"\">James Milner, Danny Ings</a>, Adam Bogdan, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/20/liverpool-joe-gomez-charlton-athletic\" title=\"\">Joe Gomez</a> and <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/24/liverpool-announce-roberto-firmino-signing-brazil-hoffenheim\" title=\"\">Roberto Firmino</a> as Liverpool’s summer recruits so far and the club remain keen on the Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke. However, there has been no breakthrough in a move for the Belgium international as yet with his &pound;32.5m release clause proving prohibitive.</p> \n<p>Clyne brings Premier League experience, pace and attacking instincts to a Liverpool side that also lacked the quality of crossing and tackling the full-back gave to Southampton last season. Rodgers had identified Clyne as his preferred choice for right-back with Glen Johnson departing on a free transfer and Jon Flanagan beset by injuries.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/1/1435748462868/Soccer---Nathaniel-Clyne-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Nathaniel Clyne has signed for Liverpool from Southampton.
