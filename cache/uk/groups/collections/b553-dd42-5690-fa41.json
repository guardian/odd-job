Peacock admitted the decision to leave the FA was a tough one to make but he is relishing a new challenge at the Championship club.</p> \n<p>He said: “This has been one of the most difficult decisions I have had to take. Leaving an organisation like the FA where it has so many outstanding individuals has not been easy.

The last 25 years of my working life has been spent with the FA and Derby County FC.</p> \n<p>“The chance to work once again at this fantastic club, which has an outstanding infrastructure and above all else highly passionate supporters and board of directors who have an ambition for success, meant the challenge of re-joining as first team coach was an opportunity I couldn’t decline.</p> \n<p>“Finally, it is always refreshing to see an English coach succeed. Furthermore it is even more difficult for this to happen abroad. In Paul Clement we have this person after his successful spells at Chelsea, Paris Saint-Germain and, of course, Real Madrid.</p> \n<p>“I was delighted when Paul offered me this opportunity to assist him in his role as the head coach of Derby County FC. I am really looking forward to the next chapter in my coaching career.”</p> \n<p>In his time at the FA, Peacock has led the Under-17s to two European Championship titles in 2010 and 2014, and has managed over 100 games in Uefa competition, with a 69% win record.</p> \n<p>He added: “I leave the FA on a positive note having just qualified once again for the Fifa Under-17 World Cup in Chile in October – I wish all the players and staff every success.”</p> \n<p>As a player, Peacock spent seven seasons with Scunthorpe in which he played more than 200 league and cup games. The FA technical director, Dan Ashworth, said: “We will sorely miss John and I can only thank him for his contribution to The FA and England, both as a coach and a coach educator.</p> \n<p>“His record speaks for itself and Derby County have a fine coach to supplement the work of Paul Clement. On behalf of everyone The FA I would like to wish John well – he leaves behind a great legacy through his work.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435563496769/John-Peacock-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"John Peacock, who has spent 21 years at the FA in two different spells, joins Paul Clement's coaching staff at Derby.

But her introduction 15 minutes earlier could have hit a snag due to a communication breakdown.</p> \n<p>“Her first name is Mana. And in Japanese ‘Not yet, not yet,’ would be ‘<em>mada</em>’ so [the words] are very close,” Sasaki said through a translator. Once Iwabuchi realised she was needed right away, the course of the match was about to change.</p> \n<p>Now Japan will stay in Edmonton, where they will play England in their semi-final on Wednesday.</p> \n<p>Patience and fresh legs paid off for the defending champions as their ball-controlling style combined with the 90F temperature gradually wore down the 10th-ranked Australians.</p> \n<p>Iwabuchi, 22, had nearly scored a minute earlier but her shot was blocked by Elise Kellond-Knight, which led to a corner. Though Aya Miyama’s set piece was headed out of the area, the ball bounced directly to Rumi Utsugi, who immediately sent it back towards goal. Azusa Iwashimizu had her shot stopped by Lydia Williams, but the goalkeeper was unable to control the rebound. The ball flew to the left, where Iwabuchi knocked it into the empty net.</p> \n<p>Japan have won four of their past five meetings with their quarter-final rivals, and their superiority was evident.</p> \n<p>Yet Australia did a better job than Japan’s previous opponents in bottling up the middle and pressuring the ball carrier to disrupt their crisp, short-passing style. In the first half, Samantha Kerr was bundled over by Iwashimizu, who was booked. Alanna Kennedy took the resulting free-kick but curled her shot well wide of a post.</p> \n<p>But the Japanese attack wore down Australia in the second half. In the 77th minute, Saori Ariyoshi broke free up the middle only to have her shot blocked by Kellond-Knight. Then came Iwabuchi’s moment of glory.</p> \n<p>“The difficulty was the heat,” said Utsugi. “Throughout the game, the resolve of all members to keep it up to the end was the challenge. However, we did manage to do that.”</p> \n<p>Japan have been victorious in all five of their matches in Canada and have won eight in a row since winning the 2011 tournament in Germany, where they beat the USA on penalties in the final.</p> \n<p>The Japanese are two victories from becoming the second nation to win consecutive tournaments after Germany triumphed in 2003 and 2007.</p> \n<p>Australia go home after completing their best run in tournament history. Australia won their first elimination game by upsetting seventh-ranked Brazil in the round of 16. “Obviously disappointed at the result, but when you look at the big scheme of things, we lost 1-0,” the coach, Alen Stajcic, said. “It was 1-0 in the 87th minute off a scrappy corner. It’s not as if we were humiliated.”</p> \n<p>They were, however, beaten by a team who showed more composure and patience. Australia exerted too much energy chasing the ball in the first 20 minutes. And when they finally got possession, they too often gave the ball away.</p> \n<p>“Certainly Japan were a lot more composed throughout the 90 minutes,” Stajcic said. “It’s a heart-breaking experience for all of us. But sometimes you learn the most from these experiences.”</p> \n<p>Sasaki was pleased with how his team kept going following several missed chances. “I was thinking that even if we didn’t have a goal in 90 minutes, we would certainly do that by 120 minutes,” he said. “While we do recognise the growth of Australia, I think the result has given confidence to the Japanese players.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Sport/Pix/pictures/2015/6/28/1435515944219/Mana-Iwabuchi-008.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":612,"width":1020,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Mana Iwabuchi, right, celebrates scoring the winner against Australia in the Women’s World Cup.
