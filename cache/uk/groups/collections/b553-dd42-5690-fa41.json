Owen says that Liverpool supporters should not be too anxious about the prospect of losing the talented 20-year-old, as Sterling would not be as difficult to replace as Luis Su&aacute;rez proved to be.</p> \n<p>“Put it this way: a year ago they lost Su&aacute;rez and he’s irreplaceable,” said Owen at the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/bt-sport-gary-lineker-champions-league\" title=\"\">launch of BT Sport Europe</a>, the channel with exclusive live coverage of the Champions League from next season. “You cannot replace someone that good. If Liverpool lose Sterling, they can replace him with the money you get. He’s a very good player with lots of potential, but you can replace him. If I was a Liverpool fan, I’d obviously be wanting an answer [as to whether Sterling will stay or go] but I wouldn’t be losing sleep if he did leave and you got a fair old chunk of money for him.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/07/roy-hodgson-england-raheem-sterling\">Roy Hodgson tells England’s Raheem Sterling to toughen up after boos</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Real Madrid are reportedly among the clubs who would offer Sterling a new home if he were to leave Liverpool, but Steve McManaman, who made a similar move when he joined Real after the expiry of his contract at Liverpool in 1999, does not believe that Real are genuinely interested, nor does he think that Sterling is ready for such a big step up.</p> \n<p>“Whether he wants to go there I don’t know, but I think the age of 20 is too young to be heading off,” said McManaman, who was 27 when he switched to the Bernab&eacute;u. “He’s still learning the trade. Is he good enough to play in a starting 11 for a Madrid, a Bar&ccedil;a or a Bayern Munich, I would very much doubt. Because your consistency levels need to be extremely high and they have not been [for Sterling] of late. So I think talk of him going to Real would be pie in the sky, to be very honest. I think if he were to leave, it would probably be for an English team.”</p> \n<p>McManaman believes Sterling should continue honing his undoubted talent before exposing himself to the demands he would face at a team that expects to win the Champions League. “I think his development is more important than anything,” said McManaman. “I just hope that whatever happens with Raheem, it’s for the benefit of him. He needs to play football regularly and he needs to keep on improving.</p> \n<p>“He’s an exceptional talent but he needs to improve. As a 19-year-old, he was the best teenager in Europe. I’d seen a lot of them in Germany, France and Spain, and I’d certainly say that he was the best.</p> \n<p>“But he was playing with Su&aacute;rez and different types of players than he played with in his second season. He had a good start to that season but it tailed off at the end, and whether that was because of him getting a bit of stick or whatever, he has to become better.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/6/10/1433964467981/Raheem-Sterling-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Raheem Sterling should focus on developing his talents, said Steve McManaman.

Gary Lineker and Michael Owen say it is only a matter of time before the Manchester United forward surpasses Sir Bobby Charlton’s record of 49 international goals.</p> \n<p>Rooney has scored 47 goals so far for England, leaving him third in the country’s all-time scoring charts – or fourth if you include own goals, of which England have benefited from 48. Charlton is top, while Lineker struck 48. Rooney is already above Jimmy Greaves (44) and Owen (40), and will be aiming to increase his tally when <a href=\"x-gu://list/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/fixtures\" title=\"\">England visit Slovenia on Sunday</a>.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/09/chris-smalling-england-manchester-united-slovenia\">Chris Smalling says he feels stronger as he faces up to England challenge</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>“He has been a terrific England player for a long time and I’m very much looking forward to him beating the record,” said Lineker, at the launch of BT Sport Europe, which now holds exclusive UK rights for the Champions League and Europa League. “There are a lot of games coming up in which you would fancy his chances of scoring. I wish him well with it, it’ll be a brilliant achievement.”</p> \n<p>Owen foresees Rooney breaking the 50-goals barrier by a long way. “Inevitably, with his quality, he’ll continue to score goals and probably set a target that may not be impossible to catch but it’ll take a good ’un to beat it,” said Owen. “But the thing really going for Wayne, apart from his quality, obviously, is that he very, very rarely gets injured. He’s strong.”</p> \n<p>Owen, who scored the last of his international goals at the age of 27 before injury and loss of form took their toll, believes the 29-year-old Rooney could play on for many years because of his robustness and style, and also because of the dearth of younger attacking talent. “I had to change because I was reliant on certain aspects of my game but I don’t think Wayne is,” said Owen. “He doesn’t rely on blistering speed, so he’s not pushing his body to the absolute limit in every game and for every sprint that he does.”</p> \n<p>Even if Rooney breaks Charlton’s record against Slovenia or in the September matches against San Marino and Switzerland, he will doubtless still face accusations that his talent has not been fulfilled at international level. However, Lineker, the Golden Boot winner at the 1986 World Cup, suggests that is unfair.</p> \n<p>“He did <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/uk/2004/jun/23/euro2004.football\" title=\"\">very well in his first European Championship [in 2004]</a>, when he was pretty much player of the tournament until he got injured,” said Lineker. “If he hadn’t got injured, England would have had a real chance of winning that. Subsequently because of injuries and England not being a great team, it’s been difficult.</p> \n<p>“I never did very well in European Championship finals but I was lucky that things worked for me in World Cups. Whenever you look at someone’s career you can say: ‘Oh, if he had done that bit better’. I mean, the only thing people throw at Messi now is he hasn’t won the World Cup with Argentina – but he’s got pretty darn close – so there’s always something. It’s easy to try to find the one negative but there are so many positives.”</p> \n<p>Owen shares that view and said his own role at Euro 2004, as well as Rooney’s, belies any notion that the former Everton player does not have the mentality to produce his best at major tournaments. “His best tournament was the European Championship and it didn’t help me,” Owen said. “Because I was his strike partner at the time and felt like I was the main striker, and then he came in to play alongside me and the roles were reversed.</p> \n<p>“He was supposed to be setting up goals for me but instead I set up three or four for him and didn’t score in the group stages, so found myself under pressure. But then he did his metatarsal in the Portugal game and that was that. But I think he was blistering in that tournament, he was on fire, so there’s no question that he performs in big games.</p> \n<p>“It’s easy to point your finger and say he hasn’t performed in the big tournaments but when have England recently? He’s been part of those teams but it’s very difficult as a striker if your team aren’t playing well to hit the headlines.”</p> \n<p>Owen suggested that one of the reasons Rooney will score many more goals for England is because there are so few young English strikers on hand now to upstage the Manchester United player. “I don’t think he’s got so much competition at present,” Owen said.</p> \n<p>“If Daniel Sturridge were fit and firing he’d be a starter – and that might alter Wayne’s position. But below that … that’s one of the reasons I think he’ll go on to play for England for a number of years and make it a really difficult haul to overtake. I just don’t see him being ousted from the team for a long time.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/6/10/1433952744539/Wayne-Rooney-has-scored-4-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Wayne Rooney has scored 47 goals for England – two behind Sir Bobby Charlton's record of 49.
