The second half of the Lionesses’ <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/28/england-send-hosts-canada-packing-in-tense-quarter-final\" title=\"\">2-1 World Cup quarter-final win</a> against Canada in Vancouver on Sunday had barely begun and Chamberlain knew her big chance had finally arrived.</p> \n<p>That universal signal that a substitute is required had the 31-year-old leaping off the bench and nearly four weeks into her third World Cup finals, making her first appearance in international football’s showpiece tournament.</p> \n<p>As a good friend of Bardsley, Chamberlain was concerned about the allergic reaction which caused the first-choice England goalkeeper’s eyes to swell up alarmingly, seriously impairing her vision. Yet with a semi-final place at stake and a hostile 54,000-strong crowd to perform in front of at a packed BC Place stadium she could afford to think solely of herself.</p> \n<p>An assured display from Mark Sampson’s second-choice goalkeeper has left Chamberlain in strong contention to face Japan in Edmonton on Wednesday night as Bardsley struggles to fully recover.</p> \n<p>Happily the latter was deemed well enough to fly to Edmonton with Sampson’s squad yesterday but her condition had been sufficiently serious to necessitate a post-match trip to hospital where a specialist examined her.</p> \n<p>“There’s still time for Bards to fully recover,” says Chamberlain, “but, as a keeper, you’ve always got to be ready regardless and it will be the same if I’m needed against Japan.</p> \n<p>“ They’re an excellent side, very technical, they’re the World Cup holders and they’ve done well in this tournament. We had a couple of their players at Arsenal last year in Yukari Kinga and Shinobu Ohno and they were both fantastic. It should be an exciting game.”</p> \n<p>After so much sitting around on international benches down the years, her adrenaline levels are suddenly surging. “I did enjoy coming on against Canada,” Chamberlain says. “It’s a strange one because you’re coming into a situation which maybe you shouldn’t enjoy because there’s so much pressure on you, but I loved it – I didn’t feel nervous at all. The situation just took me over and I embraced the opportunity. To get to a World Cup semi-final for the first time is amazing. Everyone’s chuffed to bits.”</p> \n<p>Creditably Chamberlain contained her emotions, much to Canada’s chagrin, by completing a mini warm-up before replacing Bardsley. “I thought ‘Well, they can’t start the game without me,’ so I took my time,” she says. “If I’d started rushing or panicking I wouldn’t have been in a good place.”</p> \n<p>It helped that she had been forewarned of the possibility of being called to arms. “As we came out for the second half Karen mentioned to me that she had a problem,” says the 5ft 11in keeper. “But I’d warmed up anyway during half-time because, in our position, you know anything can happen at any point in any game. As a goalkeeper you’ve got to make sure you’re always properly prepared.”</p> \n<p>As befits the great rotator of the women’s game, Sampson has now used 22 out of his complement of 23 players at Canada 2015. Chamberlain’s dramatic entrance leaves Carly Telford, the third-choice goalkeeper, as the odd one out. “Last man standing,” joked a resigned Telford as her team-mates teased her in the aftermath of the Canada victory.</p> \n<p>Although worried about Bardsley, Casey Stoney was delighted to see such a long-serving understudy finally enjoy a moment in the sun. “We’ve shown it’s a massive squad effort,” says the veteran centre-half who initially sat alongside Chamberlain, an Arsenal team-mate, on the bench. “Seeing Shiv coming on and doing well after all the sacrifices she’s made was beyond words.”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435578858264/Siobhan-Chamberlain-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Siobhan Chamberlain, left, made her first appearance at a Women's World Cup against Canada after first-choice Karen Bardsley suffered an allergic reaction.

Is Charlie Austin off to West Brom? Can Arsenal snap up William Carvalho?","standFirst":"Today’s tittle tattle is running through its target list","byline":"Simon Burnton","body":"<p>Tottenham are hoping to rekindle Tim Sherwood’s memorable bromance with <strong>Emmanuel Adebayor</strong>, by offering the Togo striker, who smashed a measly two goals last season in all competitions but who flourished during the Englishman’s brief spell in charge at White Hart Lane, in part exchange for Aston Villa’s <strong>Christian Benteke</strong>, who has flourished during the Englishman’s as-yet brief spell at Villa but who also tries a bit for other managers.</p> \n<p>West Brom are also in search of a striker, and their hopes of snapping up the former Newcastle and Chelsea hotshot Demba Ba ended when the player decided to move to Shanghai instead, so they have moved smoothly to the next name on their target list – <strong>QPR’s Charlie Austin</strong>. The 25-year-old is definitely available, but could cost as much as &pound;15m and has already been linked with approximately half the Premier League, with Newcastle, Southampton, West Ham and Chelsea the most frequently recurring names.</p> \n<p>Talking of <strong>West Ham</strong>, the new manager Slaven Bilic’s contract stipulates that if he guides them to relegation he can be sacked without notice or compensation, and also that he won’t qualify for a bonus unless the Hammers finish the season in the top eight. In other words, he’d better have negotiated himself a decent basic salary, because that’s all he’s getting. And he might have to manage without the former England winger <strong>Stewart Downing</strong>, who is a &pound;7m target for Newcastle, Leicester, Sunderland, Middlesbrough and now Stoke, who have entered the race after becoming tired of Yevhen Konoplyanka’s procrastination, the out-of-contract Dnipro wideman having stalled for weeks and now appearing to favour Atl&eacute;tico Madrid.</p> \n<p>Boro obviously have some money to spend despite their narrow failure to win promotion to the Premier League, and in addition to Downing are also linked to the <strong>Dundee United striker Nadir Ciftci</strong>, who is likely to cost around &pound;1.7m. In other striker news, Bournemouth and Norwich are ready to battle each other for the Crystal Palace striker Glenn Murray, who the Eagles might allow to leave for around &pound;5m to help fund a deal for someone more expensive. And Leicester’s Chris Wood is apparently on the very verge of signing a &pound;2m deal with Leeds, having turned down Wolves.</p> \n<p>In London-based top-flight club midfield news, Arsenal have suddenly gone off Arturo Vidal and are determined to sign <strong>William Carvalho</strong>, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/28/william-carvalho-portugal-germany-euro-under-21-championship\" title=\"\">star of Portugal’s European Under-21 Championship success</a>, instead. And Internazionale could come a-calling for Chelsea’s John Obi Mikel, but only if they can’t sign Galatasaray’s Felipe Melo, who they think is better.</p> \n<p>Defender latest: <strong>Sergio Ramos </strong>is still angling to move to Manchester United (and no surprise either if rumours of a &pound;230,000-a-week contract offer are to be believed), and Roma’s 31-year-old Greek defender Jos&eacute; Holebas is apparently a &pound;2m target for Watford.</p> \n<p>Talking of Roma, <strong>Edin Dzeko</strong> has apparently become a bit fed up with being only an occasional starter at Manchester City, leading his Bosnia team-mate Miralem Pjanic to suggest he “would run to Roma” to join him in Serie A, adding “the wages won’t be a problem”. The bad news is that Roma can’t afford his &pound;20m asking price – they want Manuel Pellegrini to accept the Serbian midfielder Adem Ljajic in part-exchange.</p> \n<p>The Monaco right-back Fabinho is, says the Sun, available for &pound;20m (&pound;15m if you ask the Mail), news which they suggest may interest City. They also suggest “a new right-back was not on their list of priorities” and “the asking price is considered too high”, so let’s not get too excited, eh? Aymen Abdennour, another member of the Mon&eacute;gasque back-line, is equally available, with his agent merrily trilling about interest from Barcelona, Internazionale, Juventus and Liverpool. “I want to play for one of the biggest clubs spoken about soon,” the player said t’other day. “I’m ready.”</p> \n<p>Also on <strong>Liverpool</strong>’s shortlist is Ludwig Augustinsson, a left-back and Swedish Under-21 international whose sudden appearance on the radar of one of England’s most cash-flashy clubs is somewhat ironic given that it’s barely a week since he called our own Under-21 side “overrated” (with some justification, to be fair) and fumed: “Some players go for such sick amounts of money in England and are a bit more expensive than they are good.” Augustinsson would apparently cost &pound;2m, though where that stands on the expensive/good scale remains to be seen.</p> \n<p>Ineffective rumour-snuffing dept: Ronald Koeman – who is hoping to bring the &pound;7m Juventus defender Angelo Ogbonna to <strong>Southampton</strong> – says that “until now we have not had a serious bid for [Morgan] Schneiderlin from United” (though “until now” seem to be key words there), and the Sampdoria president Massimo Ferrero insists “Mario Balotelli is a player of extraordinary talent but, no, we won’t be signing him” (which is what Brendan Rodgers was saying a year ago).</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/6/30/1435652012641/Emmanuel-Adebayor-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"A bromance rekindled?

However, Sweden were impressive too in their dismantling of Denmark in the semi-finals and will look to spring a surprise again. Here we rate the players in the two teams’ probable starting line-ups.</p> \n<h2>Portugal</h2> \n<p><strong>Jos&eacute; S&aacute;</strong>, goalkeeper, Mar&iacute;timo: second choice at Mar&iacute;timo but has excelled here. Conceded only one goal in four matches and although he does have a strong defence in front of him, has pulled off some spectacular stops, too. A brilliant block <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/27/portugal-humiliate-germany-to-reach-european-under-21-championship-final\" title=\"\">to deny Germany’s Amin Younes</a> at 2-0 in the semi-final came seconds before Portugal added the game-killing third before half-time. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Ricardo Esgaio</strong>, right-back, Sporting: one of the batch of Sporting youngsters in the squad. Not as attacking as Guerreiro on the other flank but has been a solid performer and has played every minute of every game so far; one of five Portuguese players to do so. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Paulo Oliveira</strong>, centre-back, Sporting: rangy and quietly effective central defender who has marshalled the back line to great effect after forcing his way into the Sporting side last season, where he has a €45m buyout clause. A threat at set pieces. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Tiago Ilori</strong>, centre-back, Liverpool: the Hampstead-born centre-back spent last season on loan at Bordeaux, where he played alongside the Sweden striker Isaac Kiese Thelin. A thigh injury has hindered his tournament but he should be fit for the final. Has set his sights on pushing for a first-team place at Liverpool next season and is still eligible to play for either Portugal, England or Nigeria. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Rapha&euml;l Guerreiro</strong>, left-back, Lorient: tremendously quick and the chief provider of width on the left flank, with S&eacute;rgio Oliveira tending to play very centrally. His substitution with just under half an hour to go against Germany in the showed just how important he is to this side. Will presumably not be a Lorient player by the time next season starts. <strong>Rating 8/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>William Carvalho</strong>, defensive midfield, Sporting: a colossus at the base of midfield and, along with Bernardo Silva, the star of the tournament. Physically imposing but has an easy, laconic style that belies the fact that he covered more ground than any other player in the group stages. <strong>Rating 9/10</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9e604939e4253f582039b4233001d0ae70c4251\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435584944764/9c224713-ec2f-499f-ac3e-2a7448a0908d-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Portugal's Bernardo Silva has picked up two man-of-the-match awards at the European Under-21 Championship\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Portugal’s Bernardo Silva has picked up two man-of-the-match awards at the European Under-21 Championship.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Jo&atilde;o M&aacute;rio</strong>, right-midfield, Sporting: pacy, tricky and, like his captain, Oliveira, his importance to the side has been somewhat overlooked such is the shadow cast by the players at the two ends of the midfield diamond. Popped up with <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/18/england-portugal-european-under-21-championship\" title=\"\">the winner against England</a> and added another against Germany. Will be a mainstay of the Sporting side next season. <strong>Rating 8/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>S&eacute;rgio Oliveira</strong>, left-midfield, Porto: captain of the side and a vital cog, despite his contributions not catching the eye as much as his midfield colleagues. Part of the side who finished runners-up in the Under-20 World Cup in 2011. Was unlucky not to open the scoring against Germany in the semi-final with a shot that pinged back off a post. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Bernardo Silva</strong>, attacking midfield, Monaco: in Portugal’s four matches, Carvalho has taken two man-of-the-match awards, Silva the other two. Plays at the tip of the diamond but is essentially the main central attacker, with the two nominal forwards often pushing wide. Has enjoyed a quite wonderful tournament thus far. <strong>Rating 9/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Ivan Cavaleiro</strong>, striker, Benfica: crashed home the third goal against Germany – quite possibly the pick of the bunch – just before half-time. Has grabbed his chance after being left out of the team <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/italy-portugal-european-under-21-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">to face Italy</a>. Crafty and creative on the ball, he plays most of his club football on the wing and has been linked with a move to join his team-mate Bernardo Silva at Monaco. <strong>Rating 8/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Ricardo</strong>, striker, Porto: scored twice in the play-off victory over Holland that took the team to the tournament and, like Cavaleiro, was left out of the team against Italy before returning to the starting lineup against Sweden and Germany. Should keep his place, although Ricardo Horta is pushing for a spot after scoring the fifth and final goal in the semi-final. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<h2>Sweden</h2> \n<p><strong>Patrik Carlgren</strong>, goalkeeper, AIK: has begun the Allsvenskan season as first choice at AIK but has at times looked a little shaky during this tournament. His poor punch from a late corner gave Jesse Lingard the chance to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/21/sweden-england-european-under-21-championship-match-report\" title=\"\">smash home England’s winner</a> in the group stage. <strong>Rating 6/10</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fac0aacd3f9e1486bce60aaec39880e0f4330a40\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435584543022/5e8924de-f39b-4e72-9750-2af65ab78550-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Sweden goalkeeper Patrik Carlgren celebrates his side's goal against Portugal in the group stage of the European Under-21 Championship\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sweden goalkeeper Patrik Carlgren celebrates his side’s goal against Portugal in the group stage of the European Under-21 Championship.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matej Divizna/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Victor Lindelof</strong>, right-back, Benfica: not part of the original squad but received a late call-up because of injury. Alexander Milosevic’s sending off and subsequent suspension, plus Joseph Baffo’s shoulder injury mean he has become an integral part of the back four, although it was his botched clearance that <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/27/sweden-denmark-european-under-21-championship-final\" title=\"\">allowed Denmark back into the game in the semi-final</a>.

Sent off half an hour into the opening game against Sweden and was a costly absentee in the defeat by England. Has returned strongly to lead the back four against Portugal and Denmark. Already has four caps for the senior side. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Filip Helander</strong>, centre-back, Malmo: lost his place in the final group game against Portugal, despite a very impressive display against England, but Baffo’s shoulder injury suffered in that game meant Helander was back in for the semi-final. Impressive beard. <strong>Rating 6/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Ludwig Augustinsson</strong>, left-back, FC Copenhagen: probably the most eye-catching member of the Sweden defence and the only one to have played every minute of every game. Better going forward than Lindelof and with the midfield tending towards narrow, he will be expected to provide attacking width. His battle with Jo&atilde;o M&aacute;rio should be one to watch. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Abdullah Khalili</strong>, right-midfield, Mersin İdmanyurdu: has looked lively, despite – or perhaps because of – a full Turkish Super League season behind him and has played on both flanks in this tournament. Both wide players look to tuck in and compress the space inside, so it will be interesting to see if he can contend with the forward raids of Rapha&euml;l Guerreiro from left-back. <strong>Rating 6/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Oscar Lewicki</strong>,<strong> </strong>central midfield, Malmo: joined Bayern Munich as a 16-year-old but now back with the club where he spent many of his teenage years. Tends to sit as the slightly deeper of the two central midfielders and prompts attacks but has scored a couple of crucial goals – not least the 88th-minute winner that gave Sweden a 4-3 aggregate victory in the play-off against France. <strong>Rating 7.5/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Oscar Hiljemark</strong>,<strong> </strong>central midfield, PSV: the captain and veteran of 36 under-21 internationals – he will break the Sweden record for caps in the final. Only two starts for PSV last season but has impressed with his tenacity here – although he faces a tough task in his personal battle with Carvalho for midfield supremacy. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>Simon Tibbling</strong>, left-midfield, Groningen: the second-youngest member of the squad, his 89th-minute goal against Portugal in the final group game took them through to the last four and meant he ousted Branimir Hrgota on the left of midfield for the semi-final. Scored the second in that game and surely did enough to keep his place. <strong>Rating 7/10</strong></p> \n<p><strong>John Guidetti</strong>, striker, Manchester City: one of the most sought-after young strikers in Europe three years ago but his club career has stalled since. Looks much happier in a Sweden shirt this tournament than he did in a Celtic one last season and is the talisman for, and chief cheerleader of, the large Swedish contingent in the stands. Scored twice and has done enough to ensure something of a scramble for his signature when he becomes a free agent in a few days. <strong>Rating 8/10</strong></p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"78e2db2045f222a9413d1e20d59ab94416e2e3e7\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/29/1435584727389/0d0115e2-b39f-48d3-ae60-df99ea54c4d7-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"The Sweden Under-21 striker, John Guidetti, has had a better time for his country than in club football of late\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Sweden Under-21 striker, John Guidetti, has had a better time for his country than in club football of late.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p><strong>Isaac Kiese Thelin</strong>, striker, Bordeaux: powerhouse forward who showed he is more than just a target-man with a brilliant flick down the line to help create Sweden’s second goal against Denmark.
