The final scene was set in spring but filmed in autumn. That meant various members of the crew had to take spray paint to the yellowing leaves to give them a flush of spring. Rob Lowe, John Cusack, Jim Carrey, Johnny Depp, Tom Cruise, Robert Downey Jr and Michael J Fox were all considered for the role of Ferris Bueller. Ferris may not be happy that he does not have a car but that synthesiser he has in his bedroom – an E-MU Emulator II no less – cost $8,000 back in 1984. Why is the Mill telling you this, you’re wondering. Because it’s the Mill’s favourite film and it is so bursting with knowledge of it that it wants to share it all to the world? Eh, not quite (that’s The Guns of Navarone, by the way). Because it wants you have some a fact or two to please a companion around the fire at the club? Hmm, not really. Because it’s using it as useful bluster to fill up some space and cover up for the fact that there is not much tittle-tattle to tittle-tattle about? Bingo! You can see for yourself below.</p> \n<p>Rafael Ben&iacute;tez has spent the last few days rearranging the furniture in his office but he finally thinks he has got it. As you enter the surprisingly small room, you immediately notice that he has moved the book case from the right side of the room to the left and that he has borrowed that old trick from interior designers of painting the inside of the shelf some shades deeper than the colour of the room. The books have been organised, of course. This time in the order in which he bought them. That way he can write his own autobiography without picking up a pen. The desk, which oddly faced the wall under the previous regime, now looks out the window. On it are three framed photos. One of his wife and kids. One of a motivational quote from Oprah Winfrey. And one of the time he caught that wild brown trout in Cogra Moss. Next to that desk is a fax machine, containing a piece of paper that details <strong>Real Madrid</strong>’s offer for <strong>Sergio Ag&uuml;ero</strong>. The Spanish club are dangerously underweight when it comes to attackers and are determined to get their man who is determined to stay in Manchester. He may get his way and stay but <strong>Edin Dzeko </strong>won’t. He has been booked in for a one-way ticket to <strong>Roma</strong>.</p> \n<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Paul Pogba</strong> ... zzz ... <strong>Manchester City</strong> ... zzz ...<strong> Manchester United</strong> ... zzz ... &pound;70m ... zzz.</p> \n<p>Over in <strong>Chelsea</strong>, Jos&eacute; Mourinho has been looking in the mirror, both literally and metaphorically. When doing so, he stares deeply and rubs his sideboards and his chin with his right hand. He has been thinking about his image last season. Too serious, too po-faced, too austere, too forbidding, too somber. If only the world knew the real him. Thoughtful, happy, chirpy, playful and funny, really, really funny. Sides-hurting funny. Milk-exiting-the-nose-funny. ‘Damn, if only the could see that. How can I make them see that? There must be something I could do that would make the world see how funny I am. Think, Jos&eacute; think’. And then, ding. Off went the lightbulb in his head and in popped the idea. Sign <strong>Robert Green </strong>as a replacement for Petr Cech. Like all the best jokes, it was so simple, yet so clever. ‘You’re a genius, Jos&eacute;! Mwah!’ He wiped the excess saliva off the mirror before running up to Roman’s office to ask him if his credit card still worked.</p> \n<p><strong>Cech</strong>, in case you are wondering, will be boarding the Do One bus that will only be making one stop and one stop only, <strong>Arsenal</strong>. Lucky for him, he won’t have to sit there all alone on the bus, looking out the window, with only his iPod and the Combat Jack Show for company. <strong>Gonzalo Higua&iacute;n</strong> and <strong>Edinson Cavani </strong>will also be there with him. <strong>Julian Draxler</strong> too. But that’s not all. <strong>Hatsune Miku</strong>, <strong>the Bogeyman </strong>and the entire cast of <strong>The Adventures of Bullwhip Griffin</strong> will fill up the rest of the red double-decker as well as half of another bus following behind. Seriously.</p> \n<p>Up in <strong>Liverpool</strong>, Brendan Rodgers has just put down the phone. He did so with a polite goodbye but once the receiver was safely back in its cradle, he kicked the desk very hard. The result? A very sore big toe that led to Brendan hopping around the room and swearing like a sailor whose bezkozyrka has just been blown overboard. The reason? Southampton said that while a neatly-stacked pile of &pound;10m did look delightful, they believe that <strong>Nathaniel Clyne </strong>is worth another &pound;5m more. Brendan was sure that &pound;10m would be enough and that the extra could &pound;5m could be spent on having his best quotes painted onto the walls around Anfield. He may have to ditch that idea now. Sigh. Poor Brendan. </p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7e295521235e07563843d5914327b95e6f96c98a/0_60_4080_2450/4080.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2450,"width":4080,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Sergio Agüero","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Martin Bernetti/AFP/Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-19T07:48:03Z","lastModified":"2015-06-19T07:51:42Z","metadata":{"commentable":false,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Ian McCourt","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/ian-mccourt"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Sergio Agüero","Real Madrid","Manchester City","Football","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"football/sergio-aguero","webTitle":"Sergio Agüero"},{"id":"football/realmadrid","webTitle":"Real Madrid"},{"id":"football/manchestercity","webTitle":"Manchester City"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Ian McCourt","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/ian-mccourt"}}],"series":{"title":"Rumour Mill","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/football/series/rumourmill"},"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","headlineAccentColour":"#005689","matchStatusPre":"#676767","matchStatusDuring":"#4bc6df","matchStatusAbandoned":"#da1d1d","matchStatusPost":"#333333","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"football"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/19/transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-real-madrid","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4avmx","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/19/transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-real-madrid","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/19/transfer-rumours-sergio-aguero-real-madrid"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7e295521235e07563843d5914327b95e6f96c98a/0_60_4080_2450/4080.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":2450,"width":4080,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Sergio Agüero reacts to the news that he is moving to Madrid.

During <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/17/england-colombia-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">Wednesday’s 2-1 win against Colombia</a> in Montreal’s Olympic Stadium, Bardsley did as much as anyone to ensure England secured the victory that earned them second place in Group F. Indeed without the Manchester City goalkeeper’s heroics Sampson’s side could conceivably have been held to a draw that would have left them facing a daunting round-of-16 fixture against the USA next week.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/gallery/2015/jun/18/womens-world-cup-2015-final-round-of-group-games-in-pictures\">Women's World Cup 2015: final round of group games – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As it stands, Norway will be tough enough opponents but Even Pellerud’s side will have to find a way of evading Bardsley’s reach and bravery. Such courage was in evidence on Wednesday when she used her face to repel the danger from the advancing Carolina Arias who looked certain to volley a bouncing ball goalwards until the 30-year-old’s intervention on the verge of half-time.</p> \n<p>“I just did everything I could to get my body in the way,” said Bardsley. “In the end I had to put my beak there instead. You’ll do anything to keep the ball out. I did whatever I could do to get close to the ball before she made contact.</p> \n<p>“I had a feeling she was going to lob me. That was my instinct so I got myself as big as I could. If they’d scored it would have become a different game. I’m really pleased with the save.”</p> \n<p>That stop meant England preserved their 2-0 lead until Bardsley was finally lobbed by the influential Lady Andrade in stoppage time. The California-born keeper was blameless for that one at the end of an evening that compensated for her late error prompting the concession of a goal in the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/13/england-mexico-womens-world-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">2-1 victory over Mexico</a> last Saturday.</p> \n<p>“Very annoying,” said Bardsley of that rare slip before emphasising that she had shrugged off the torrent of criticism that came her way in its aftermath. “In my position I’m always going to get a bit of flak,” she said. “I take it with a grain of salt. People can say what they want. It’s their opinion. We forget what we don’t need to take with us.”</p> \n<p>Like their goalkeeper, Sampson’s Lionesses seem to be improving with every game. “That’s what tournament football’s all about,” said Bardsley. “It’s about finding your feet in the first game, finding what works and gaining confidence. We’re feeling a lot of support. There’s a lot of positive energy we’re taking forward.”</p> \n<p>Pellerud’s players will be plotting ways of removing the wind from England’s sails but Sampson’s squad remain undaunted. “We know what Norway are capable of,” acknowledged Bardsley. “We’ve seen great set pieces from them in this tournament and they’ve drawn with Germany in the group stage. Any team capable of holding Germany is very good. They’re going to be dangerous but we’ve got momentum.”</p> \n<p>Sampson has spoken of the need to “select the right weapons” against Norway but Steph Houghton retains the utmost faith in the coach’s judgment. “Mark’s trusting us to play different formations depending on the opposition and it’s working well,” said England’s captain. “We showed our quality, tempo, control and game management against Colombia.</p> \n<p>“Norway will be tough, they’ve got physical, strong players who’ve experienced big tournaments but we’re gaining momentum.”</p> \n<p>Monday evening’s match will have a feel of “back to the beginning” for Sampson, who began his time in charge of the national side with a game against Norway after succeeding Hope Powell 18 months ago.</p> \n<p>Played against the rather more relaxed backdrop of La Manga in southern Spain it ended in a 1-1 draw. The challenge for the 32-year-old now is to raise the bar sufficiently to secure the win which would set England on course for a potential quarter-final against Canada in Vancouver.</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Football/Clubs/Club_Home/2015/6/18/1434664619222/Karen-Bardsley-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"The England goalkeeper Karen Bardsley comes out to gather another cross during her fine performance against Colombia.

Are the strange bounces to blame – or is it just an excuse for poor play?</p>","byline":"Caitlin Murray in Vancouver","body":"<p>It was a sunny but breezy Saturday afternoon in Vancouver, and the US women’s national team had just finished their morning training. The session, of course, took place on an artificial training pitch that had been plopped in the middle of a park with lush, green grass everywhere else.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/blog/2015/jun/17/usa-at-the-womens-world-cup-what-we-learned-from-the-group-stage\">USA at the Women's World Cup: what we learned from the group stage</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The Guardian asked USA forward Abby Wambach about her <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/16/abby-wambach-usa-womens-world-cup-nigeria\">new role as a substitute in a World Cup</a>. Wambach seemed to have something else on her mind, though. She said her focus was on getting on the end of a cross against Sweden, which she did, but: “If it’s on grass, I think it goes in.”</p> \n<p>In one fell swoop, the turf issue that had been such a major talking point in the months before the tournament was back. Wambach had blamed the playing surface for her failure to score goals, and news outlets latched on to it. High-profile voices in the media called it a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV29SjtXV-M\">weak excuse</a> that “<a href=\"http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/2015worldcup/article/13076391/artificial-turf-excuse-us-women-struggling-attack\">borders on absurd</a>.”</p> \n<p>Any excuse for the USA’s failures to score goals certainly wasn’t going to be met with sympathy. The Americans have had their chances that they’ve failed to finish in ways that have nothing to do with the playing surface. Simply put, the American attack has been underperforming.</p> \n<p>But was Wambach completely wrong?</p> \n<p>In the USA’s scoreless draw against Sweden, Wambach nearly scored a game-winner in the 72nd minute. She dived head-first into the goal area and connected well on a cross, driving it low toward the turf. But the ball took a high and unnatural bounce toward the hands of goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl, who didn’t have to reach out to guide the ball over the crossbar.</p> \n<p>“The ball as it comes off my head against Sweden hits a dry turf and bounces higher,” Wambach said. “If it hits grass, it’s harder for a goalkeeper to react. If the ball bounces higher, the goalkeeper has more time to react off the turf.”</p> \n<p>Wambach hasn’t been entirely alone in her complaints. Japan’s captain Aya Miyama said “<a href=\"http://www.vancouversun.com/sports/Reviews+mixed+about+Place+artificial+turf+installer+says+pitch/11125796/story.html\">dribbling was difficult</a>” on BC Place’s new turf, which was installed specifically for the Women’s World Cup.</p> \n<p>Once Wambach’s comments made the rounds, the US women were back on message. Forward Sydney Leroux said: “I’ve been playing as hard as I play on grass. It’s a World Cup and, yes, it is different but nothing can be changed now.” Defender Ali Krieger said: “Everyone’s playing on the same surface and we just have to adapt to it.”</p> \n<p>This tournament in Canada is the first-ever senior World Cup to be held by FIFA on artificial turf. The men’s tournament has always been held on real grass, and is planned to be on grass in the next iterations planned through 2022 in Qatar. Recently resigned Fifa president Sepp Blatter said last year that “artificial pitches are the future”.</p> \n<p>The debate about whether artificial turf <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/01/us-football-idUSBRE84002Q20120501\">causes more injuries</a> than natural grass continues to rage, with plenty of evidence to support both sides. Fifa, in defending the use of artificial turf, has <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/womensworldcup/news/y=2014/m=11/news=ekstrand-the-total-risk-of-injury-is-the-same-on-football-turf-as-it-i-2472281.html\">cited professionals</a> who say it is safe.</p> \n<p>But now, in the thick of the tournament, the debate has shifted to one about the game itself – about winning, and entertainment value.</p> \n<p>“I think that there are a lot more goals in this tournament if it weren’t for the turf, having probably been on the losing end of that battle a few times now,” Wambach said.</p> \n<p>Some teams have had no trouble scoring. Look at Germany, which posted a 10-0 blowout over Ivory Coast. Ecuador isn’t likely to think this tournament has too few goals, either – the World Cup debutants conceded 17 goals over three group games.</p> \n<p>But across the tournament, when blowouts against the weakest teams are discounted, this could shape up to be a conservative tournament where goals are concerned. </p> \n<p>The average goals per game at the end of the group stage was 2.97, but that was skewed by some of the lopsided results that come as a result of expanding the tournament from 16 teams to 24. Take out thoseblowouts against new teams, and the average drops by nearly a goal per game and below <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/sports/soccer/abby-wambach-says-us-would-be-scoring-more-on-grass.html\">the average for the 2011 tournament</a>. As knockouts begin and games tighten, the average could further shrink.</p> \n<p>After her game-winner against Nigeria, Wambach reiterated her assessment of the turf – but acknowledged her responsibility for not scoring.</p> \n<p>“Scoring goals is not that easy, and I’m not making any excuses. I need to finish chances that are handed to me,” Wambach said. “But the turf does make the ball bounce differently and you think differently about that game. That’s just the reality and that’s what my comments meant.”</p> \n<p>Wambach seemed acutely aware of the renewed debate she started and the criticism she spurned toward the US women’s national team. Whether she was just speaking off the cuff or not, she has no problem with the small uproar she caused.</p> \n<p>“It’s awesome that we’re talking about women’s football,” Wambach said. “It’s awesome that we’re having some of these discussions. It’s awesome that we’re analysing and hyper-dissecting things that we’ve said. To me, that shows growth. Even if it’s hard on my PR guy, I say: ‘Hey man, this is all good stuff. We’re talking about women’s football one way or another.’ ”</p>","section":"Football","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/10c1fe809dab48730e016382acb2dcc8176fc750/0_70_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Mike Hewitt - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images","altText":"Abby Wambach holds off Onome Ebie of Nigeria.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Mike Hewitt - FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-06-18T13:45:45Z","lastModified":"2015-06-18T19:08:32Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":0,"contributors":[{"name":"Caitlin Murray","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/caitlin-murray"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Women's World Cup 2015","Football","Sport","Women's football","US sports","USA women's football team"],"tags":[{"id":"football/women-s-world-cup-2015","webTitle":"Women's World Cup 2015"},{"id":"football/football","webTitle":"Football"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"football/womensfootball","webTitle":"Women's football"},{"id":"sport/us-sport","webTitle":"US sports"},{"id":"football/usa-womens-football-team","webTitle":"USA women's football team"}],"section":{"id":"football"},"topics":[{"displayName":"Caitlin Murray","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/caitlin-murray"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"football"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/football/2015/jun/18/womens-world-cup-artificial-turf","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4av6x","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/football/2015/jun/18/womens-world-cup-artificial-turf","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/18/womens-world-cup-artificial-turf"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/10c1fe809dab48730e016382acb2dcc8176fc750/0_70_3000_1799/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1799,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Abby Wambach holds off Onome Ebie of Nigeria.
