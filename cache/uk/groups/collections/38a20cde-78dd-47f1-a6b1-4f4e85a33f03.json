surprising revelations on Monday have merely added to the speculation that surrounds the Tour de France leader and 2013 champion","byline":"William Fotheringham at Pierre Saint-Martin","body":"<p>The elegant town of Pau has been the scene of more than its share of cycling mysteries, and another one was added to the list on Monday when Sir Dave Brailsford raised a minor storm by stating that Team Sky’s lawyers were on the case of people who he <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-team-sky-tour-de-france-dave-brailsford\" title=\"\">suspected had hacked into Chris Froome’s training files</a>. That was accompanied by the removal from YouTube of a video marrying what purported to be Froome’s power-meter and pulse data with television footage from the 2013 Tour finish at Mont Ventoux.</p> \n<p>The following morning Brailsford said he would prefer to focus his attention on the day’s stage from Tarbes to the hill-top finish at Pierre Saint Martin but the genie was out of the bottle. Froome, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-tour-de-france-team-sky-cycling\" title=\"\">having won the 10th stage in convincing style</a>, was emphatic the video was a “sideshow” and that any suggestion it might imply he was using performance- enhancing methods or substances was “nuts, especially as the data in question is two years old”. It was even being reported that the 2013 champion was willing to undergo independent physiological testing and release the results to prove his innocence.</p> \n<p>“What haven’t I done? I’ve tried to be as much a spokesman as I can for clean cycling,” Froome said. “I’ve spoken to the CIRC (Cycling Independent Reform Condition), I’ve made suggestions to the governing body to implement things like night-time testing. I’ve pointed out when I’ve felt there hasn’t been enough testing, in places like Tenerife. What else is a clean rider supposed to do?”</p> \n<p>As Pau enigmas go, Hackgate was as nothing compared with the vexed question of how <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2010/sep/30/alberto-contador-positive-test\" title=\"\">a minute quantity of clenbuterol got into Alberto Contador’s urine sample</a> in 2010 – a contaminated food supplement, concluded the court of arbitration for sport - or <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2007/jul/26/cycling.tourdefrance\" title=\"\">just where Michael Rasmussen had been training</a> and where the Dane went after his midnight flit from the 2007 race.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-tour-de-france-team-sky-cycling\">Tour de France 2015: Chris Froome makes huge statement with stage win</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>The release and removal of the video did raise a spectre from the past, however, but of a different kind to those in the Contador and Rasmussen stories and further back Lance Armstrong’s infamous drug-denying press conferences in Pau in 1999 and 2001 during the Tour. The spectre was the 2013 race when Froome spent much of the final week protesting his probity. The media and fans were split between sceptics, believers and benefit-of-the-doubters. As he pointed out after the finish here, there is little more that he can do.</p> \n<p>The man behind the video was a blast from several cycling pasts as well, a genial Frenchman named Antoine Vayer, who tweets under the handle <a href=\"https://twitter.com/festinaboy\" title=\"\">@festinaboy</a>, an ironic reference to his period spent in the mid-1990s as a trainer at the notorious French squad who were thrown off the 1998 Tour amid one of the Tour’s most dramatic doping scandals.</p> \n<p>Vayer spent his time at the team trying to shield the handful of riders who wanted to race clean and later became a fervent campaigner against doping, in which capacity he produced a column at the Le Monde newspaper discussing his estimated power-output figures for the riders in the Tour. It is impossible to assess the accuracy of Vayer’s figures but his articles were taken seriously enough by Team Sky during the 2013 Tour for Brailsford to meet him in an attempt to convince him of Froome’s probity. The video was removed from YouTube but copies remained <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2xyt27_chris-froome-tour-de-france-2013-mont-ventoux-srm_sport\" title=\"\">available online</a> and Vayer remained defiant, stating on Twitter: “Soon a new video impossible to hack even by the best hacker lawyer.”</p> \n<p>The video did not offer any evidence of doping or superhuman performance, always assuming the figures are genuine, which is of course impossible to say. To muddy the waters further, the bulk of the footage at the key moments does not actually show Froome but other riders. The spectacular manner in which Froome turned his legs on the Ventoux in 2013 raised questions at the time but it corresponded to the way in which the team trained, the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2013/jul/15/team-sky-chris-froome-tour-de-france\" title=\"\">Sky trainer Tim Kerrison told the Guardian</a>.</p> \n<p>Whether the figures are genuine or not, what is on show does not look suspicious. The power figures constantly oscillate but that is familiar to anyone who has used a power meter. There is a visible increase in pulse rate when Froome makes the key effort to drop Alberto Contador - as would be expected - but critically, that increase comes with a distinct time lag, which is normal. The human body is not a car where the rev counter responds instantly.</p> \n<p>The mystery is why Sky should feel it necessary to make it public that they feared Froome’s data had been hacked, and their lawyers were on the case. The answer probably lies in the memories of 2012 and 2013, when Bradley Wiggins’ and Froome’s Tours were both infected by innuendo: strike first, in the hope that the mutterings on Twitter can be nipped in the bud. It is a blunt instrument and it remains to be seen whether it works.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436890748978/4fcb1d42-8a53-4628-82e5-051f5c85af7a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Eric Gaillard/Reuters","altText":"Chris Froome rides clear of the field to win stage 10 of the 2015 Tour de France.","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Eric Gaillard/Reuters"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-14T16:12:26Z","lastModified":"2015-07-14T23:40:07Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":75,"contributors":[{"name":"William Fotheringham","uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/lists/tag/profile/williamfotheringham"}],"feature":true,"keywords":["Tour de France 2015","Chris Froome","Cycling","Drugs in sport","Sport","Tour de France"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/tour-de-france-2015","webTitle":"Tour de France 2015"},{"id":"sport/chris-froome","webTitle":"Chris Froome"},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling"},{"id":"sport/drugs-in-sport","webTitle":"Drugs in sport"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"},{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[{"displayName":"William Fotheringham","topic":{"type":"tag-contributor","name":"profile/williamfotheringham"}}],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#951c55","navigationDownColour":"#e02b7f","navigationButtonColour":"#ffffff","ruleColour":"#e02b7f","headlineColour":"#ffffff","quoteColour":"#fdadba","standfirstColour":"#ffffff","metaColour":"#ffffff","dividerColour":"#aa4977","backgroundColour":"#951c55","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#FFFFFF","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#e02b7f","kickerColour":"#fdadba","colourPalette":"feature1"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/blog/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-team-sky-hacking-tour-de-france","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ak5p","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/blog/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-team-sky-hacking-tour-de-france","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jul/14/chris-froome-team-sky-hacking-tour-de-france"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/14/1436890748978/4fcb1d42-8a53-4628-82e5-051f5c85af7a-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Froome rides clear of the field to win stage 10 of the 2015 Tour de France.
