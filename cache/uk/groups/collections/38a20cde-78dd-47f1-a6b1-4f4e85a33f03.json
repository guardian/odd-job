Fabian Cancellara is a popular wearer of the yellow jersey, but is destined to hold on to it for one stage before being forced to withdraw from the race after riding on with three broken lower vertebrae. Mark Cavendish and his lead‑out train are unpopular losers of the sprint finish, with manager, Brian Holm, labelling it “a historical fuck‑up”. Oh dear.</p> \n<h2>MONDAY</h2> \n<p>The Tour enters Belgium, a cycling-mad country that has produced one Tour de France winner, Lucien van Impe, since Eddy Merckx won the last of his five titles in 1974. At the summit of Mur de Huy, where Joaquim Rodr&iacute;guez beat Chris Froome to stage victory, Merckx chatted with another five-times winner, the Frenchman Bernard Hinault. The subject of their conversation? It’s possible that Merckx was telling Hinault about the statue that had been unveiled in his honour that day shortly before the peloton passed through Merckx’s home village of Meensel‑Kiezegem, about an hour from Brussels. Philippe, the actual king of Belgium, was in Li&egrave;ge for the next day’s stage, but prompted considerably less awe and adoration.</p> \n<h2>TUESDAY</h2> \n<p>Stage four finishes in Cambrai, where tooth decay among the press pack is actively encouraged by the strategic placement of large bowls of the local boiled sweets, named B&ecirc;tises. The French word for “nonsense” or “stupid mistake”, they are rumoured to have been invented accidentally by the son of a local confectioner and were originally produced in mint flavour only, but now cross the spectrum of flavoursome, sugary goodness. It’s a sweet day for popular rider Tony Martin too. After three near misses in three days, he finally wears the yellow jersey for the first time in his career. His delight is short-lived, as he’s forced out of the race with injury two days later.</p> \n<h2>WEDNESDAY</h2> \n<p>Poignant reminders of the first world war are everywhere as the peloton pedals through the Somme from Arras to Amiens, passing on their way depressing number of memorials to and cemeteries for almost 600,000 fallen. The Lochnagar mine crater, the giant by-product of explosives laid by the British army’s 179th Tunnelling Company Royal Engineers underneath a German strongpoint called Schwaben H&ouml;he in 1916, provides a grisly reminder of the giant explosion that, 99 years ago on 1 July, marked the beginning of the battle of the Somme. Preparations are under way to mark next year’s centenary.</p> \n<h2>THURSDAY</h2> \n<p>Ever wondered how they have the leaders’ jerseys ready for the end of each stage? The Backie was taking the afternoon air outside the media centre in Le Havre when we saw a man acting suspiciously in the back of an official Tour van. Closer inspection revealed that what looked like a sophisticated counterfeiting operation was actually a man printing the ceremonial yellow, green, polka dot and white jerseys with the required badges and sponsorship logos. Upon finishing, he folded them carefully, placed them in a satchel that he slung over his shoulder before cycling half a kilometre to the finish line to hand them over for the presentation ceremony.</p> \n<h2>FRIDAY </h2> \n<p>A star is born. Daniel Teklehaimanot , one of two Eritreans in the MTN-Qhubeka team becomes the first black African rider to wear one of the major leaders’ jerseys in the Tour de France. The King of the Mountains, he can barely contain his delight as he realises his life’s ambition by wearing the polka dot jersey at the start of the stage. He joins a five-man breakaway to win the only climbing point on offer and his team manager later reveals that instead of immediately dropping back to the bunch as he was supposed to, Teklehaimanot was so caught up in the occasion that he forgot to do so and had to be summoned.</p> \n<h2>SATURDAY</h2> \n<p>A manmade crater of a different kind. The tourist board’s station staff extol the virtues of their locale to the visiting media and it is M&ucirc;r-de-Bretagne in Brittany with which The Backie was most impressed. Created when a hydroelectric power plant was built, Lac de Guerl&eacute;dan is the biggest lake in the region and is completely empty so that work can be carried out. “Behold the exceptional marvel of the submerged valley and lunar landscape,” says the local guide, of a stunning non-water feature that is just one rusting shopping trolley and several discarded traffic cones short of perfection. <strong> </strong></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436631591619/tony-martin-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tony Martin took the overall leader's yellow jersey but abandoned a day later after a crash.

A French friend and I were discussing it a couple of days ago and she recalled what she felt when her father used to take her to see it when she was a young girl. It went something like ‘we’d get there at about 9 or 10am and sit there baking in the sun for hours. There was nothing to do and I was bored stiff. Then the riders would blur by in less than 20 seconds and dad said ‘right, that was great, time to go home’ and so we did.

Towards the end of a preposterously up-and-down week for his Etixx-Quick-Step team, the 30-year-old sprinter latched on to the wheel of one rider and riskily barged another out of his way en route to victory by half a bike length on the Boulevard des D&eacute;port&eacute;s in Foug&egrave;res. What could have been another boulevard of broken dreams for the Manxman will live in the memory as the scene of a much-needed triumph.</p> \n<p>“I’m very happy,” he said. “The guys could have given up on me after messing up the last two sprints. I’ve been too anxious and I’ve gone too early. If anything I went too late here but Greipel got the jump and I was perfect on him. He could have closed the door on me but he didn’t. He sprinted straight because he’s a gentleman.” Holding his young daughter Delilah in his arms, Cavendish could not help but laugh. “She understands what’s going on now,” he said. “She was angry I didn’t get the bunch of flowers the other day, so she’s happier now.”</p> \n<p>Stage seven was on the flat from Normandy to Brittany through the Mayenne <em>d&eacute;partement</em>, in sweltering heat with hardly a breeze. With limited opportunities remaining and his team-mate Tony Martin forced to withdraw from the race with a broken collarbone, the absence of such a vital cog in the Etixx-Quick-Step lead-out wheel might have scuppered any hopes Cavendish had of winning a stage. Happy to improvise in the closing stages, he played a waiting game, tucking on to Greipel’s wheel before muscling his way through a gap left by John Degenkolb and Peter Sagan to cross the line punching the air in triumph.</p> \n<p>Even though Martin finished Thursday’s stage with a compound fracture, it actually seemed something of a surprise when he failed to sign on in Le Havre. Despite being <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/tour-de-france-2015-tony-martin-race-in-doubt-stage-six-crash-zdenek-stybar-cycling\" title=\"\">nursed over the line in the French port</a>, the German they call “Panzerwagen” found time to chat cordially with team-mates and look after his media responsibilities before attending to the more gruesome and, one would think, more pressing concern that was the shattered collarbone poking through the skin of his shoulder. Were it not for strict doctor’s orders, one suspects he would almost certainly have begun this stage.</p> \n<p>“I will follow the race on TV today from the hospital,” he said from Hamburg, after undergoing surgery. “It will be strange but that’s life and cycling. I have to try to see the glass half full and keep the good memories. I had a great first part of the Tour with a great team around me. I won a stage and wore the yellow jersey for the first time in my career.”</p> \n<p>In Martin’s absence Chris Froome took over as race leader but did not don the yellow jersey until after the stage, as dictated by historical precedent and the president of the commissaires’ panel. Indeed, even if Froome had been given the option of wearing the <em>maillot jaune</em>, the Sky rider said it is not a garment in which he would have felt comfortable under the circumstances. “Out of respect for Tony I would never have worn it in any case,” he said. “That’s not the way to get the yellow jersey due to someone else’s misfortunes. I was second on the GC so there was no way to wear it.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4cbdfc65d07623ce35d3f164876143b095e86b4\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436554043922/c143a0c6-6212-4b6f-9529-b7f1ed1765eb-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Mark Cavendish\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Cavendish celebrates his stage win.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim de Waele/Tim de Waele/Corbis</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>In the red and white polka dot corner, the Eritrean rider <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/10/tour-de-france-daniel-teklehaimanot-africa-eritrea-cycling\" title=\"\">Daniel Teklehaimanot</a> was the proudest man in France as he made history by becoming the first black African to reign as king of the mountains.

In search of the sole king of the mountains point on offer, Teklehaimanot was to the fore and got his dues. The Lampre-Merida rider Kristijan Durasek, the obligatory Cofidis contribution of Luis &Aacute;ngel Mat&eacute; and homeward bound Bretagne-S&eacute;ch&eacute; Environnement duo Anthony Delaplace and Brice Feillu kept him company and the last remnants of the quintet were swept up with 10 kilometres to go as the sprinters boarded their respective trains.</p> \n<p>On Saturday the peloton will spend the second of three days in the cycling hotbed of Brittany, travelling from the region’s capital Rennes to a hill-top finish at M&ucirc;r-de-Bretagne. Froome, happy to be back in yellow, which he described as “a great privilege”, will begin with an 11-second lead. “To be honest, I don’t really know the M&ucirc;r-de-Bretagne,” he said. “I’m going to have to go and do a bit of studying myself tonight.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/10/tour-de-france-2015-stage-seven-live\">Tour de France 2015: stage seven – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/f5a5c5431fc0af7cd58bc724707e4b88d74dcf04/0_34_3309_1985/3309.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1985,"width":3309,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Great Britain's Mark Cavendish celebrates as he crosses the finish line at the end of the 190.5 km seventh stage of the 102nd edition of the Tour de France cycling race on July 10, 2015, between Livarot and Fougeres, northwestern France.

Eritrea is gripped by a fanatical love for the sport. Bicycles are everywhere in the capital, and racing has become known as the country’s “unofficial fifth state-sanctioned religion”. Five-time Tour de France winner <a href=\"http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/hinault-sees-non-white-tour-de-france-winner-in-near-future\">Bernard Hinault has predicted</a> that the east African nation’s riders “are the next Colombians”. </p> \n<p>Sitting 2,325 metres above sea level, at the tip of an escarpment of the Great Rift Valley, Eritrea breeds strong cyclists. “The geography is a main part of why we’re so good,” Teklehaimanot said, “but we also just work hard.</p> \n<p>“When I was young, around 2005 and 2006, and I watched [the tour on] TV, me and my friends talked a lot about the bikes, the wheels – but we didn’t really know <em>how</em> they are racing. So now I’m really excited to be a part of that same race,” he said. </p> \n<p>It has been a long journey for the Eritrean. In 2010, he started catching the attention of European teams when he came <a href=\"http://www.procyclingstats.com/rider.php?id=140812&amp;season=2010\">first in the African Championship road race</a>, won the individual and team time trials, and came first overall in the Tour of Rwanda. But Teklehaimanot’s entry to World Tour cycling was blighted by <a href=\"http://rouleur.cc/journal/racing/eritrean-cyclists-visa-problems\">recurring visa problems</a>, which sabotaged his chances to compete at the highest level with his team at the time, Orica-GreenEdge. <br /></p> \n<p>“There are so many African riders – from Eritrea, South Africa and Rwanda – but it’s not easy to become a part of the big teams. We have to work hard, so I’m thankful for MTN-Qhubeka,” he explained. </p> \n<p>Kudus said he felt the same. “It’s not easy when you come from Africa. There should be more invitations, and more opportunity. Especially for places like Rwanda, where riders are becoming better and better. But we need more opportunities – it’s more difficult to get to Europe for us.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Teklehaimanot (centre) with Kudus at the start of the first stage of the Tour de France in Utrecht.\"> \n <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;blockquote class=&quot;instagram-media&quot; data-instgrm-version=&quot;4&quot; style=&quot; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div style=&quot;padding:8px;&quot;&gt; \n  &lt;div style=&quot; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&quot;&gt; \n   &lt;div style=&quot; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf//42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB/lQPb79drWOyJVa/DAvg9B/rLB4cC+Nqgdz/TvBbBnr6GBReqn/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I/fZou/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n  &lt;p style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://instagram.com/p/4q0sKIAYTy/&quot; style=&quot; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none;&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;A photo posted by Team MTN-Qhubeka p/b Samsung (@teammtnqhubeka)&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;time style=&quot; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&quot; datetime=&quot;2015-07-03T09:33:36+00:00&quot;&gt;Jul 3, 2015 at 2:33am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;script async=&quot;&quot; defer=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;https://platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;\"></iframe> \n <figcaption>\n  Teklehaimanot (centre) with Kudus at the start of the first stage of the Tour de France in Utrecht. \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<h2>Recognition and respect</h2> \n<p>In what has historically been a predominantly white, European and exclusive sport, the inclusion of black riders is still, lamentably, a novelty. “I hope this is the beginning of a shift,” said MTN’s Scottish team manager, Brian Smith, adding that there was not enough respect for black riders in the peloton.</p> \n<p>“You look at <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2012/apr/06/ethiopian-home-worlds-greatest-runners\">long-distance running</a>, it’s all Africans now. You just need one racer to break through, and it makes others realise they can do it too. It’s the same here. We don’t see enough black cyclists.”</p> \n<p>Though little could mar Teklehaimanot’s win on Thursday, a racism row surrounding another of MTN’s Eritrean riders, Natnael Berhane, has exposed the serious racial politics that hang over professional cycling. </p> \n<p>At the Tour of Austria, which runs in tandem with the Tour de France, <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/09/mtn-qhubeka-racism-tour-austria-natnael-berhane\">MTN’s management are said to have appealed to the UCI</a>, cycling’s governing body, to have the Belarusian rider Branislau Samoilau expelled from the race for racial abuse. </p> \n<p>The team’s principal, Douglas Ryder, said: “One of the riders from another team said to Natnael Berhane: ‘Get out of the way you effing n*****’. Just outrageous.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I’ve told them: go show the world what you can do</p> \n  <footer> \n   <cite>Brian Smith, team manager</cite> \n  </footer> \n </blockquote> \n</aside> \n<p>By way of apology, Samoilau has <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/cycling/tour-de-france/11730282/Tour-de-France-2015-Racism-row-ruins-African-teams-landmark-success.html\">reportedly paid a month’s salary</a> to the <a href=\"http://qhubeka.org/\">Qhubeka foundation</a>, a charity that helps provide Africans with bicycles, although no official statement has been released. </p> \n<p>Smith said MTN frequently battled prejudice, but that the peloton was slowly learning to respect the talent of the African team, and recognise their right to contest at the front of the race. “Lots of test teams are trying to globalise the sport, and Africa is an untapped entity. Daniel was the trailblazer, that’s why there are so many [Eritreans] coming through now,” he said. </p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6e85eba9473387978d69d3495ca2066a5f23241\"> \n <img src=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436518870299/7484fab7-dbdf-440d-b7f7-78e9476f16d3-460x276.jpeg\" alt=\"Kudus, left, and Teklehaimanot at the start of stage two of the Tour de France.\" width=\"460\" height=\"276\" class=\"gu-image\" /> \n <figcaption> \n  <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kudus, left, and Teklehaimanot at the start of stage two of the Tour de France.</span> \n  <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Doug Pensinger/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p> “Although we’ve got foreign people on the team [American Tyler Farrar and Norwegian rider Edvald Boasson Hagen, among others], this is an African team. We want African riders. We want to make sure this team is where all the African talented riders come to perform. Not to be a development team – we want to keep the cream of the crop.”</p> \n<p>Last month, Teklehaimanot and Kudus returned to Eritrea to compete in the national championships. In the infamously closed-off country – better known for <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/africa/eritrea\">dire human rights records</a> and contributing to <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/commentisfree/2015/apr/24/mediterranean-migrant-crisis-eritrea-western-allies\">Europe’s growing migrant crisis</a> – the two riders are stars. </p> \n<aside class=\"element element-pullquote\"> \n <blockquote> \n  <p>I’m really proud to be an Eritrean riding.

After the nationals, the government wished us good luck for the tour. We met the president, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isaias_Afwerki\">Isaias Afwerki</a>, in his office. It was a big moment for us,” Teklehaimanot said. </p> \n<p>Afwerki has been in office since independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and no national elections have been held in this time. While <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/world/2011/jul/12/eritrea-football-players-missing-tanzania\">Eritrean footballer players are notorious</a> for using international matches as an opportunity to escape and seek asylum, the cyclists say they are proud of their country’s support.</p> \n<p>“They are really supportive, the president too, we got lots of media attention – everyone is watching us,” said Kudus.</p> \n<p>At this Tour de France, soon to enter its second week and enter the <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/ng-interactive/2015/jul/01/tour-de-france-2015-stage-by-stage\">brutal mountain stages</a>, Smith said the Eritreans were hoping for further glory. “I want to give them the opportunity to try to win in one or two stages,” he said. “We’ve got no general classification hopes, no big sprint hopes, so it’s save energy and grab a stage. I’ve told them both: go show the world what you can do.”</p> \n<p>For Teklehaimanot, there’s no doubt this is his moment: “My family are waiting for the tour, they’ll be watching on television, and my wife is coming to Paris [for the final stage]. I’m really proud to be an Eritrean riding. It’s big for me, for the team also. I’m really happy.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436516133763/b5cd4ff9-2fbd-4c39-ac81-3bfbcc1d2fba-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Manuel Blondeau/Corbis","altText":"Daniel Teklehaimanot","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Manuel Blondeau/Corbis"}],"bodyImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/10/1436518254023/dd63cb03-eac3-40d0-948c-38f18d599707-2060x1236.jpeg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Daniel Teklehaimanot with Europcar rider Perrig Quemeneur and Cofidis’s Kenneth Van Bilsen during Wednesday’s breakaway.

While his Etixx-Quick Step team-mate, Zdenek Stybar, was powering to victory in Le Havre, Martin appeared to veer violently right, barging into another rider who in turn took out Vincenzo Nibali and Nairo Quintana in a domino effect. Martin later said he had clipped the wheel of a rider in front of him. “He abandons,” a spokesman said.</p> \n<p>Later it emerged that Martin will undergo surgery in Hamburg on Friday. “The collarbone is in lots of pieces, so it was a major impact,” said Helge Riepenhof, the team doctor. “One of the pieces came through the skin, which means it’s an open fracture. Therefore, even if it was Tony’s wish to start tomorrow, I have to say he is not allowed to.</p> \n<p>“He needs surgery straight away, and that is why we are going to the hospital now. We will fix the collarbone there. He is already on antibiotics. It’s a serious injury, and that is why we can’t risk anything and why he cannot be at the start tomorrow.”</p> \n<p>Accelerating past on the outside, Chris Froome was lucky to avoid hitting the deck, too. The Sky team leader was sent into a speed-wobble but remained upright and eventually crossed the line unscathed but with a buckled wheel. Nibali initially blamed Froome for the crash and claimed to be “very angry”, but the Sky rider later visited the Astana team bus to have it out with his rival, who apologised upon seeing footage of the incident.</p> \n<p>“Did we clear it all up?” said Nibali. “Yeah. We are not footballers, we are cyclists.” <a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/07/tour-de-france-tony-martin-wins-stage-four\" title=\"\">In Martin’s absence, Froome takes over as race leader</a> as the next-best-placed rider on general classification. Martin is the second race leader to withdraw through injury, following Fabian Cancellara’s abandonment on Monday.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/09/tour-de-france-2015-stage-six-live\">Tour de France 2015: stage six – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>As the various riders involved in the crash extricated themselves from the pile-up, it quickly became apparent the <em>maillot jaune</em> had come off worst. Riding home one-handed, he was flanked by several team-mates, with Julian Vermote and Michal Kwiatkowski pushing him over the line. “I was extremely unlucky,” said Martin. “I can’t really remember what happened. I touched the wheel of the rider ahead of me. It’s the Tour, luck and bad luck are very close together. It’s often the way accidents happen. You’re not going that fast and then you fall over each other with all your weight.”</p> \n<p>With its short, steep climb to a finishing straight that levels out for the final 400m, this stage to Le Havre prompted considerable debate over who would prevail: sprinters or <em>puncheurs</em>, specialists on this terrain. Such sharp ascents can prove tricky for out-and-out fast men such as Andr&eacute; Greipel and Mark Cavendish, but are relished by the likes of Peter Sagan, the Tinkoff-Saxo rider whose quick acceleration up small climbs made him odds-on favourite for the win. Sadly, for the fourth time in five stages he finished second or third, this time behind the former cyclo-cross star Stybar, who made an impressive contribution to an increasingly weird week for Etixx-Quick Step.</p> \n<p>In just six stages, the Belgian team have had the mother of all internecine bust-ups and been publicly flamed by their owner. They have won two stages and narrowly missed out on two others. They have had a sporting director suspended for a stage after film of him celebrating in a team car showed he was not wearing a seatbelt. And now, having finally got Martin into the yellow jersey for the first time in his career after two near misses, the keystone Quick Steppers have lost it sooner than expected.</p> \n<p>Before their incident-packed finish, the peloton had a little under 191 uneventful kilometres with which to contend, setting off from Abbeville in the Somme, heading to Dieppe and then making their way along the north-west coast to the port of Le Havre. On a route that proved the source of many aerial views of topaz seas lapping up against gleaming white cliff faces, the 188 remaining competitors were spared the downpours and violent buffeting feared by many and instead rode in glorious sunshine.</p> \n<p>Cruising along after a three-man breakaway that at one point opened a gap of over five minutes, the early excitement within the peloton came in the form of a puncture for Martin and a minor crash for the Movistar rider Alejandro Valverde, who slipped on gravel following a post-pee wheelspin. So far, so quiet.</p> \n<p>Following the abandonment of their star sprinter, Nacer Bouhanni, on Wednesday, it was no surprise to see Cofidis revert to their old habit of justifying their otherwise futile existence by committing Kenneth van Bilsen to the escape party, where he was accompanied by Daniel Teklehaimanot and Perrig Qu&eacute;m&eacute;neur.</p> \n<p>Teklehaimanot realised a lifelong ambition by securing the polka dot jersey, becoming the first black African in race history to wear it, while Bilsen’s late doomed solo effort ended inevitably with 3km to go. He was swallowed by the bunch before Stybar surged clear to take the win on a day of mixed fortunes for his team.</p> \n<p>Etixx-Quickstep are not the only team being put through the wringer and have at least enjoyed plenty of success to go with their assorted misfortunes. Orica-GreenEdge, the team of the British twins Adam and Simon Yates, have already lost three riders to broken bones while their Tour debutant, Michael Matthews, struggles on despite two fractured ribs. The Australian team would have been fancied to win Sunday’s team time-trial from Vannes to Plumelec but in a discipline where the clock stops when the fifth rider crosses the finish line, they will do well to get five men down the starting ramp. “The team time trial was one of our goals,” mused one member of their backroom team. “Now with six riders, it’ll be a rest day before the rest day.”</p> \n<p>Stage seven takes the peloton from Livarot, hosting the Tour for the first time and known for the pungency of its Graindorge cheese, to Foug&egrave;res along a long and flat route that Etixx-Quick Step have earmarked as a final chance for Mark Cavendish to open his account before the race enters the mountains. In what has been a preposterously topsy-turvy week for them, absolutely anything could happen.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/live/2015/jul/09/tour-de-france-2015-stage-six-live\">Tour de France 2015: stage six – as it happened</a> </p> \n</aside>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/7918f728dc8aa57d3c1a41bb11ae86038274662f/0_0_5184_3110/5184.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":3110,"width":5184,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Bryn Lennon/Getty Images","altText":"Le Tour de France 2015 - Stage Six<br>LE HAVRE, FRANCE - JULY 09:  Injured yellow jersey wearer Tony Martin of Germany and Etixx-Quick Step is given assistance after a fall close to the finish during stage six of the 2015 Tour de France, a 191.5km stage between Abbeville and Le Havre, on July 9, 2015 in Le Havre, France.
