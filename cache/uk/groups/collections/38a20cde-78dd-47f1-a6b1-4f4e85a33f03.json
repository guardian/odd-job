I’d won pretty much every race building up to the Tour and I did feel as if once I got past the halfway mark in the 2013 Tour that I was almost just hanging on to the finish.</p> \n<p>“This year I feel as if I’ve come in much fresher, a lot more mentally prepared and I feel as if I’m getting stronger in this year’s race. Now it’s up to other teams to put the pressure on us. This is the heart of the race now. This is where all the action’s going to be happening, we’re going to see who has done their homework, who has got what in the mountains. This is where the real race in yellow truly starts.”</p> \n<p>The route from the start in Utrecht, through the Netherlands, Belgium and northern France, was expected to challenge Froome, but he has thrived and is relishing the high mountain stages where the yellow jersey is won.</p> \n<p>Froome, the second Briton to win the Tour after Sir Bradley Wiggins in 2012, said: “Coming into this race there was a lot of last year still in the back of my mind. This first week was really one of the biggest concerns. The big thing was not to actually lose any of the time to any of the contenders.</p> \n<p>“It is the first mountain top finish. Everyone’s going to be looking at this as a gauge as to how things are going to go the next two weeks. It’s a very important stage, but I’m very grateful that I’m in this position now, that I’m not trying to make up time on someone else.</p> \n<p>“To actually be in this position, to have gained quite substantial amounts of time on a lot of my big rivals, this is the dream scenario at the moment. I really just have my team to thank for that.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/676ff843883181e0d8dbae8327dfa8e1b4d54818/0_22_3180_1909/3180.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1909,"width":3180,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Eric Gaillard/REUTERS","altText":"Team Sky rider Chris Froome of Britain crosses the finish line of the team time-trial 9th stage of the  Tour de France<br>Team Sky rider Chris Froome of Britain crosses the finish line of the 28km (17.7 miles)  team time-trial 9th stage  of the 102nd Tour de France cycling race from Vannes to Plumelec, France, July 12, 2015.REUTERS/Eric Gaillard","cleanCredit":"Photograph: Eric Gaillard/REUTERS"}],"bodyImages":[],"webPublicationDate":"2015-07-13T13:09:09Z","lastModified":"2015-07-13T14:07:40Z","metadata":{"commentable":true,"commentCount":59,"contributors":[],"feature":false,"keywords":["Chris Froome","Tour de France 2015","Tour de France","Team Sky","Cycling","Sport"],"tags":[{"id":"sport/chris-froome","webTitle":"Chris Froome"},{"id":"sport/tour-de-france-2015","webTitle":"Tour de France 2015"},{"id":"sport/tourdefrance","webTitle":"Tour de France"},{"id":"sport/team-sky","webTitle":"Team Sky"},{"id":"sport/cycling","webTitle":"Cycling"},{"id":"sport/sport","webTitle":"Sport"}],"section":{"id":"sport"},"topics":[],"embeddedVideos":[],"adTargetingPath":"sport"},"style":{"navigationColour":"#005689","navigationDownColour":"#4bc6df","navigationButtonColour":"#005689","ruleColour":"#4bc6df","headlineColour":"#333333","quoteColour":"#999999","standfirstColour":"#676767","metaColour":"#999999","dividerColour":"#dcdad5","backgroundColour":"#ffffff","savedForLaterTrueColour":"#333333","savedForLaterFalseColour":"#999999","kickerColour":"#005689","colourPalette":"news"},"links":{"uri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/2015/jul/13/chris-froome-tour-de-france-team-sky-cycling","shortUrl":"http://gu.com/p/4ajva","relatedUri":"http://mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items-related/sport/2015/jul/13/chris-froome-tour-de-france-team-sky-cycling","webUri":"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/13/chris-froome-tour-de-france-team-sky-cycling"},"shouldHideAdverts":false,"headerImage":{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/676ff843883181e0d8dbae8327dfa8e1b4d54818/0_22_3180_1909/3180.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1909,"width":3180,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Chris Froome believes he is in better shape than when he won the Tour de France two years ago.

Ouch.</p> \n<p>“Personally, it’s quite difficult for me,” said Roche. “This was a massive opportunity for me for a stage win. Over the last few Tours I’ve been riding as a <em>domestique </em>and winning a TTT is something very particular, something you work at. There’s no luck, it’s all about sticking together and being there. It’s something that I really dreamed of, so it’s a bit of a tough one. But looking at the bigger picture, Froomey is in top shape, we kept the jersey, we’re in contention and we’re really ready to be in the mountains now.”</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"x-gu://item/mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/items/sport/gallery/2015/jul/12/tour-de-france-stages-eight-and-nine-in-pictures\">Tour de France, stages eight and nine – in pictures</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Having put down a significant marker in last month’s Crit&eacute;rium du Dauphin&eacute; the BMC team of Tejay van Garderen were again triumphant on a day when they had made no secret of their hopes of getting their leader into the <em>maillot jaune</em>. It was not to be: on the race’s first rest day Froome remains 12 seconds clear of the American. Crucially Froome also put further time into his fellow Fab Four members Vincenzo Nibali, Alberto Contador and Nairo Quintana.</p> \n<p>“Those guys have that tag, the Fab Four, which is getting a little irritating hearing that,” said Van Garderen, the disgruntled fifth Beatle.</p> \n<p>“I’m not offended not to be named in that. All those guys in the Fab Four have won Grand Tours. I’ve had a couple of good top fives in the Tour but I’m yet to finish on the podium or win one.”</p> \n<p>Team time trials are usually held on stage four or five of Grand Tours; UCI rules decree they “shall take place during the first third of the race” in order to give teams as fair a chance as possible of fielding a full-strength line-up in a discipline where the time of the fifth man to cross the finishing line is the one recorded.</p> \n<p>Including rest days this year’s Tour de France is already nine days into a total of 23, on the ninth stage of 21 in an event where 40% of the total distance has already been completed. No matter which way you look at it this was a clear case of world cycling’s governing body ignoring its own guidelines.</p> \n<p>Orica GreenEdge suffered most from the anomalous scheduling having lost Michael Albasini, Simon Gerrans and Daryl Impey to injury in the opening week while their Tour debutant, Michael Matthews, struggles on with damaged ribs that continue to restrict his ability to breathe. He was nursed through this stage by his remaining team-mates without having to do a tow in front.</p> \n<p>Truth be told, the Australian team had no complaints about misfortune for which little or no legislation could realistically have been made. They lost a third of their team to a crash that took place on stage three and treated a time trial they originally had high hopes of winning like a Sunday afternoon countryside spin, finishing just shy of five minutes behind the winners.</p> \n<p>Of the big-budget big-hitters Nibali’s Astana team were first out and set an early clubhouse lead of 32min 30sec that was quickly beaten by Quintana’s Movistar outfit, who finished 11 seconds faster. All eyes promptly turned to Tinkoff Saxo, BMC and Sky, the teams of Contador,&nbsp;Van Garderen and Froome respectively, who were last out on the road in that order.</p> \n<p>On a course that finished with a tough climb up the 1.7km C&ocirc;te de Cadoudal, Contador came off worst of the trio; his Tinkoff-Saxo team finished 28 seconds behind the eventual winners. BMC posted a time of 32min 15sec, which Sky only just failed to match.</p> \n<p>With Froome, Geraint Thomas, Leopold K&ouml;nig, Richie Porte, Wouter Poels and Roche tasked with closing out the stage after Peter Kennaugh, Ian Stannard and Luke Rowe had exhausted themselves on the flat, Poels hoisted the white flag at the bottom of the ascent and, of the remaining quintet, Roche was found ever so slightly wanting in the closing metres.</p> \n<p>“We really can’t be too disappointed with that,” said Froome. “For everyone’s morale it would’ve been fantastic to have been able to get the stage win today, but more importantly we’ve kept the yellow jersey, we’ve put time into most of our rivals. We’ve got to be happy with that.</p> \n<p>“It’s one thing not to lose any time to your rivals, but to actually gain quite substantial amounts on quite a lot of contenders – it’s put us in a fantastic position. Some other rivals – Nibali, Quintana – they’ve both lost quite a substantial amount of time already so the pressure’s definitely on them to attack once we go into the mountains,” said Froome. “It’s for the other guys to get the yellow jersey from me now.”</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/21114be05d50d2a25618e68b408069048bf63be4/0_0_2200_1320/2200.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1320,"width":2200,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Jeff Pachoud/AFP/Getty Images","altText":"Riders of the Great Britain's Sky cycling team, including Great Britain's Christopher Froome (L), wearing the overall leader's yellow jersey, compete in the 28 km team time-trial, the ninth stage of the 102nd edition of the Tour de France cycling race on July 12, 2015, between Vannes and Plumelec, western France.

de France: Chris Froome keeps yellow but BMC win team time trial</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Richie Porte has confirmed cycling’s worst-kept secret: he will leave Team Sky at the end of the year. The Australian is in the final year of his contract with the British team and talk has been rife the 30-year-old is looking to pursue his dreams of Grand Tour success elsewhere.</p> \n<p>He finally laid his cards on the table following the Tour de France’s 28km team time trial from Vannes to Plumelec. “I think it’s the worst-kept secret in the world,” Porte told SBS after the ninth stage, won by BMC. “I’ve got to take my own opportunities.”</p> \n<p>After four years at Sky, Porte is as one of the biggest names in this year’s transfer market and has been linked to BMC. Etixx-QuickStep have also reportedly shown interest and Orica-GreenEDGE are on the lookout for a general classification rider.</p> \n<p>He is in Sky’s team for the Tour but as a key domestique for his good friend Chris Froome, who has tightened his grip on the yellow jersey heading into the second week.</p> \n<p>Porte acknowledged he would have much more opportunity to lead a Grand Tour outfit elsewhere. “I’ve won Paris-Nice and Catalunya this year, and had my big opportunity in the Giro, which didn’t quite got to plan,” he said. “But I’m ready, I’m in the prime of my career now the next few years, so I need to go and lead a team.”</p> \n<p>Porte has proven himself at Sky in the Tour de France as a domestique and played crucial roles when Bradley Wiggins won the 2012 Tour and Froome took the title the following year.</p> \n<p>Two months ago, Porte led Sky at the Giro d’Italia after starting the season with outstanding form. But after a strong start to the Italian classic, Porte’s race fell apart following a controversial two-minute penalty for accepting a replacement wheel from compatriot and Orica-GreenEDGE rider Simon Clarke. Porte eventually abandoned the race because of injuries from a crash.</p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/media/81e04c8bf59c94a105ed329c3f6eee257affa2f6/0_40_3000_1802/3000.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1802,"width":3000,"orientation":"landscape","credit":"Doug Pensinger/Getty Images","altText":"Porte on his way to 65th place in the individual time trial on stage one of the 2015 Tour de France in Utrecht, Netherlands.

Fabian Cancellara is a popular wearer of the yellow jersey, but is destined to hold on to it for one stage before being forced to withdraw from the race after riding on with three broken lower vertebrae. Mark Cavendish and his lead‑out train are unpopular losers of the sprint finish, with manager, Brian Holm, labelling it “a historical fuck‑up”. Oh dear.</p> \n<h2>MONDAY</h2> \n<p>The Tour enters Belgium, a cycling-mad country that has produced one Tour de France winner, Lucien van Impe, since Eddy Merckx won the last of his five titles in 1974. At the summit of Mur de Huy, where Joaquim Rodr&iacute;guez beat Chris Froome to stage victory, Merckx chatted with another five-times winner, the Frenchman Bernard Hinault. The subject of their conversation? It’s possible that Merckx was telling Hinault about the statue that had been unveiled in his honour that day shortly before the peloton passed through Merckx’s home village of Meensel‑Kiezegem, about an hour from Brussels. Philippe, the actual king of Belgium, was in Li&egrave;ge for the next day’s stage, but prompted considerably less awe and adoration.</p> \n<h2>TUESDAY</h2> \n<p>Stage four finishes in Cambrai, where tooth decay among the press pack is actively encouraged by the strategic placement of large bowls of the local boiled sweets, named B&ecirc;tises. The French word for “nonsense” or “stupid mistake”, they are rumoured to have been invented accidentally by the son of a local confectioner and were originally produced in mint flavour only, but now cross the spectrum of flavoursome, sugary goodness. It’s a sweet day for popular rider Tony Martin too. After three near misses in three days, he finally wears the yellow jersey for the first time in his career. His delight is short-lived, as he’s forced out of the race with injury two days later.</p> \n<h2>WEDNESDAY</h2> \n<p>Poignant reminders of the first world war are everywhere as the peloton pedals through the Somme from Arras to Amiens, passing on their way depressing number of memorials to and cemeteries for almost 600,000 fallen. The Lochnagar mine crater, the giant by-product of explosives laid by the British army’s 179th Tunnelling Company Royal Engineers underneath a German strongpoint called Schwaben H&ouml;he in 1916, provides a grisly reminder of the giant explosion that, 99 years ago on 1 July, marked the beginning of the battle of the Somme. Preparations are under way to mark next year’s centenary.</p> \n<h2>THURSDAY</h2> \n<p>Ever wondered how they have the leaders’ jerseys ready for the end of each stage? The Backie was taking the afternoon air outside the media centre in Le Havre when we saw a man acting suspiciously in the back of an official Tour van. Closer inspection revealed that what looked like a sophisticated counterfeiting operation was actually a man printing the ceremonial yellow, green, polka dot and white jerseys with the required badges and sponsorship logos. Upon finishing, he folded them carefully, placed them in a satchel that he slung over his shoulder before cycling half a kilometre to the finish line to hand them over for the presentation ceremony.</p> \n<h2>FRIDAY </h2> \n<p>A star is born. Daniel Teklehaimanot , one of two Eritreans in the MTN-Qhubeka team becomes the first black African rider to wear one of the major leaders’ jerseys in the Tour de France. The King of the Mountains, he can barely contain his delight as he realises his life’s ambition by wearing the polka dot jersey at the start of the stage. He joins a five-man breakaway to win the only climbing point on offer and his team manager later reveals that instead of immediately dropping back to the bunch as he was supposed to, Teklehaimanot was so caught up in the occasion that he forgot to do so and had to be summoned.</p> \n<h2>SATURDAY</h2> \n<p>A manmade crater of a different kind. The tourist board’s station staff extol the virtues of their locale to the visiting media and it is M&ucirc;r-de-Bretagne in Brittany with which The Backie was most impressed. Created when a hydroelectric power plant was built, Lac de Guerl&eacute;dan is the biggest lake in the region and is completely empty so that work can be carried out. “Behold the exceptional marvel of the submerged valley and lunar landscape,” says the local guide, of a stunning non-water feature that is just one rusting shopping trolley and several discarded traffic cones short of perfection. <strong> </strong></p>","section":"Sport","displayImages":[{"urlTemplate":"http://images.mobile-apps.guardianapis.com/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/7/11/1436631591619/tony-martin-009.jpg?width=#{width}&height=#{height}&quality=#{quality}","height":1236,"width":2060,"orientation":"landscape","caption":"Tony Martin took the overall leader's yellow jersey but abandoned a day later after a crash.
