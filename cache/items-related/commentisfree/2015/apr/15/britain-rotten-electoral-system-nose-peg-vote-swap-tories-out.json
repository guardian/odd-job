It's just that something that didn't happen isn't usually news, which is why the LibDems are routinely hammered for a couple of things that did happen and not cited as part of the reason a lot of other things did not. Oh, and, of course, as Polly tacitly acknowledges, the LibDems got ~25% of the vote last time, but only 10% of the MPs, whereas the Tories got ~35% and got around 45% of the MPs. It's funny how this state of affairs (which has been the case for a long time) is apparently only going to be considered unfair if UKIP or the Greens break 10% but get nothing for it.</p> <p>(I'm still not saying I'm remotely happy with the last five years, and I can't understand anyone who still wants to vote Tory, but voting LibDem is clearly not the same as voting Tory.)</p>","date":"15 April 2015 7:04pm","isoDateTime":"2015-04-15T18:04:49Z","status":"visible","webUrl":"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/50503994","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/50503994","numRecommends":45,"isHighlighted":false,"userProfile":{"userId":"1050536","displayName":"Scurra","webUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/1050536","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/profile/1050536","avatar":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/11/23/Scurra/281a6476-6f12-4fbe-a7fe-5ee84b64c2c5/60x60.png","secureAvatarUrl":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/discussion/avatars/2010/11/23/Scurra/281a6476-6f12-4fbe-a7fe-5ee84b64c2c5/60x60.png","badge":[]},"responseTo":{"displayName":"kristinezkochanski","commentApiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/50503537","isoDateTime":"2015-04-15T17:52:27Z","date":"15 April 2015 6:52pm","commentId":"50503537","commentWebUrl":"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/50503537"}}]},{"id":50503365,"body":"<p>Some of us haven't taken the clothes peg off since last time Polly.</p>","date":"15 April 2015 6:47pm","isoDateTime":"2015-04-15T17:47:49Z","status":"visible","webUrl":"http://discussion.theguardian.com/comment-permalink/50503365","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/comment/50503365","numRecommends":47,"isHighlighted":false,"userProfile":{"userId":"14434124","displayName":"Tricky_Disco","webUrl":"https://profile.theguardian.com/user/id/14434124","apiUrl":"http://discussion.guardianapis.com/discussion-api/profile/14434124","avatar":"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif","secureAvatarUrl":"https://static-secure.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/site_furniture/2010/09/01/no-user-image.gif","badge":[]},"responses":[{"id":50509410,"body":"<p>Or the time before.
